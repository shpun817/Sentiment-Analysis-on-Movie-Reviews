"1","Dil Bechara",10,"Love is more important than life.","One of the finest acting I've ever seen.I suggest you to please watch this. I think this is far better than movies originated from nepotism. Shushant Sir has done great work and lived the moment in this film. Everything was perfect."
"2","Dil Bechara",10,"Fabulous","This is the only Indian movie which made me cry..... You need to be emotionally strong specially after the dismissal of the Sushant Singh Rajput.. he is great and he was capable to be no 1 in india.. Because of nepotism we lost a well deserved star. I was deeply upset by the ending but overall it was a great movie"
"3","Dil Bechara",10,"He left a mark and will always be remembered !","Dear Manny/Augustas/Sushant Singh Rajput
you did leave a mark, you left all your viewers speechless.
Be it in the reel world or the real world.
You were the most amazing character and I enjoyed you act, and sobbed at the same time, watching you smile and crack jokes made me so emotional.
How could a person this cheerful with the brightest not with us anymore.
This movie was very warm just the right mix of humor and drama and emotions.
Its so fresh that one can re-watch it a 100 times and still wont get bored.
I recommend it to all the people out their, because it is not just about cancer or just the regular teenage love story, it far more than that.
Give it a watch and I'm sure you'll agree with me."
"4","Dil Bechara",10,"What a masterpiece!!!!!","This movie made me cry so so much I don't remember when was the last time I cried so much. Seriously life is so unpedictable live your life to fullest and enjoy this movie with your friends and family. Take care of your loved ones. Seriously what a fantastic movie. Lots of love Sushant you will be missed so so much."
"5","Dil Bechara",10,"Such an emotional tribute to a wonderful actor.","There is no better way to give tribute to a genuinely amazing actor. The film was pretty emotional and touching. Such natural acting from #Sushanth and #SanjanaSanghi and a brilliant execution from other the cast and crew. The movie indeed had plot holes and rushed up situations but I don't think anyone will notice those stuffs as the movie maintained a emotionally touching storyline and knowing the fact that Sushanth left us made it way more emotional and can't finish the movie without releasing a single drop of tear."
"6","Dil Bechara",10,"One last time!","Sushant will live on forever in our hearts! Its just sad that we never appreciated him enough while he was alive! Loved the movie!"
"7","Dil Bechara",10,"A HEARTHWARMIMG STORY. THE MOVIE WILL TOUCH THE CORE OF YOUR HEART","Again a brilliant performance by Sushant Singh Rajput.We will miss him, will miss his art.
Brilliant performance by all the cast, it felt real.
Great movie!"
"8","Dil Bechara",10,"SSR's acting was beyond words..excellent!!!","I'm not writing this from an emotional side of mine.. but I've rated 10/10 for this film only because of Sushant's acting..the way he conveyed each n every emotion, be it with his eyes/body language..speechless..simply marvellous!!Such a huge loss for the industry!! Rest of d casts were average I'd say!!"
"9","Dil Bechara",10,"Its not about Sushant Singh.","Its life
The one who want to live they die
And the one whom can live they choose to not....."
"10","Dil Bechara",10,"Ssr you will be always missed buddy We love you","A must watch movie... This movie will tell you what lies between birth and death is life that we generally forget to live...

"11","Dil Bechara",10,"Missing you SSR","The best movie and I was in my tears while watching and all I was looking at Sushant Singh Rajput. He brings life to each frame and loved his work. Simply magical."
"12","Dil Bechara",10,"Awesome movie.","Don't know what to write just after the watching the movie but watch this without even a second thought. Love SSR!"
"13","Dil Bechara",10,"The best adaptation yet","This is the best adaptation of The Fault in Our Stars, the book. Both the Hollywood adaptation and this one made changes and are not word for word. But the story, intent and screenplay in this one tops any other adaptation that I have seen, including the plays."
"14","Dil Bechara",10,"A movie that touches the heart in many ways","After watching the movie. I could only say it touched the heart and emotions in the movie make us learn many things in life. I would only say there are some movies which are actually meant to be kept forever in our collection.. this movie is one of those.. Best of 2020."
"15","Dil Bechara",10,"Touching and heart-melting movie","A must watch movie... This movie will tell you what lies between birth and death is life that we generally forget to live... Live your life to the fullest..you never know what will gonna happen next <U+0001F494> Amazing performance by Sushant, Sanjana, Swastika etc <U+0001F44D><U+0001F44D>"
"16","Dil Bechara",10,"Heartwarming and such an Emotional one!","Really just would bring tears into your eyes, this story depicts an amazing and a truly Lovely Story of Kizi Basu and Immanuel Rajkumar Jr. !"
"17","Dil Bechara",10,"Dil Bechara is a mood, Sushant is the Highlight","Hard to think Sushant is gone. But he leaves behind another epic film!You can't take your eyes off him, the movie is amazing. It's easy breezy.I think it's going to be hard to get into the technical details of the totality of the film but what's exceptionally clear is that you've got to Watch it for Sushant... he was made for the movies...He knows his craft, you can sense his powerful presence in every scene, and that's the true mark of an efficient actor. The beauty is in the details - from getting the walk of the character right to setting the mood right, Sushant steals the show."
"18","Dil Bechara",10,"This is How you treat a reamke...","If you had seen The orginal good for you. Now you know this one is better than that. I am not sayin this because it's Sushant last venture. When I heard that they are going to make the remake of 'The fault in Our Stars'. I thought they are going to ruin this.
But Mukesh Chabra proved me wrong. Shushant is the best Manny you can ever get.
And then There is A.R. Rehman sir with his music nothing can get wrong."
"19","Dil Bechara",10,"Seri kizie basu","The movie was absolutely fantastic. After so long I have cried while watching a movie. The conversation between kizie's dad and Manny was really emotional."

"21","Dil Bechara",10,"A Film Beyond just Acting, It has become Emotion, Performance par excellence","Heart wrenching movie unbaisedly, Absolutely roller coaster of emotions..We have lost a superstar.. shame on bollywood mafia nexus."
"22","Dil Bechara",10,"Sushant Singh Rajput","I Smiled, Laughed, Loved and I Cried, Cried and Cried... Kizzie Basu the most lovely character well portrayed by the actress..

Pls watch it subtitles..."
"25","Dil Bechara",10,"Its not a movie. Its an emotion","I'm the one who already watched the original flick ""The fault in our stars"" and still writing that this movie feels like a breeze of fresh air. Don't know if it's the Sushant Singh Rajput effect or my emotions who wanted to see him in every frame of the movie. He acted brilliantly and Sanjana Sanghi also acted very well to add the perfect touch of emotions as Kizi Basu. Watch the movie to feel the SSR magic live. I wish if he was here to watch the audience response after the movie."
"26","Dil Bechara",10,"An emotional,heart touching and tribute to our lost hero.","We all know that it is the remake of the hollywood movie The Fault in Our Stars but while watching this movie I had totally forgot that their was a movie named The Fault in Our Stars.

"28","Dil Bechara",10,"Sushant acted even death naturally!","I had watched fault in our stars movie in 2014 and definitely it made me cry! Wasn't expecting so much from this remake but Sushant even in his final acting made this movie a memorable one for his fans. He acted even death so naturally that none of us can now wake him up from the eternal acting masterpiece!
I wish His final movie will make the Bollywood a better place for outsiders and May the real actors get the piece of it!
To shushant... to his final masterpiece!"
"29","Dil Bechara",10,"Siri SSR !!","He was a star. Every frame lights up when he is there. Brilliant story for a fitting finale. You will be missed for sure. Watch it for the emotional rollercoaster of a film.

The Cinematography is great. The debutant Director did pretty good job. The songs by AR Rehman Sir is so melodious that I will listen it 50 times a day and still not get bored. And One Thing more Specific I would like to say that this movie is an example of how you make a Remake with same level of performances in both Remake and Original movie. This is how you do justice to Original Movie. This is how a Remake should be made. Now I would like to say something about Sushant. Brother I will really miss you there were lots of moments in the movie where I was getting goosebumps along with tears in my Eyes. Now also while writing this review my eyes is moist with tears.. I hope you are more successful and loved by everyone in a parallel universe. Love you FOREVER."

"88","Dil Bechara",10,"Critics won't rate this movie!!","Spectacular performance by Sushant and the rest of the cast. Enjoyed Sushant's soulful acting and the overall direction of the movie. Saif shines in his friendly appearance. It's a shame that somebody with the calibre of Sushant had to die to prove his mettle. It's a wake up call for all viewers to value real content instead of chasing old daddies of bollywood blindly.Critics also need to cautious of their words. While they have every right to share their opinions, they should not put actors under severe pressure by throwing insulting words.A must watch movie, which should not be reviewed by any newspaper or a movie magazine critics. This time, let the audience and just audience speak."

"100","Dil Bechara",10,"Ssr","Speechless. Every moment hits on heart.It is hard to believe that you are not here."
"101","The Kissing Booth 2",5,"Predictable","I basically predicted the entire movie after 10 Minutes."
"102","The Kissing Booth 2",1,"Awful","Firstly why was this 2 hours long??? Secondly why was it that bad, but ended on such a cliff hanger??My advise would be give this one a miss..."
"103","The Kissing Booth 2",5,"Just another typical Netflix romance movie...","This may be shocking for you, but I actually found the first movie of this franchise quite enjoyable. However, in the sequel, The Kissing Booth loses all of its quirky charms, which replaced by factors that makes a typical Netflix coming of age romance movie, cliche and predictable."
"104","The Kissing Booth 2",NA,"Cringy, Awkward and Childish","2 <U+2B50>'sThe first one was cute because Joey and Jacob were in love on camera so the movie was kind of magical.This one was so bad. They were so awkward around each other, even 'by the phone', it was hard to watch. Their interaction were just too cringy and uncomfortable.The plot was meh. The love triangle or square was done horribly.The 2 <U+2B50>'s were for Joey and Joel, they were awesome together. They should have gone to that direction aka best friends to lovers. It would have been much nicer."
"105","The Kissing Booth 2",8,"Enjoyable","The movie is what it's suppose to be. I wasn't disappointed by it. I had a good time while watching. Might feel a bit unreal, but it's a teenager movie and it's amusing and shows that sometimes people have a hard time communicate but in the end they manage to solve their issues by doing it. Think it was a bit better than the first, and the fact it add other people and stories in between, wasn't at all a problem to me, it was better that way. There was more to see, instead of just focusing on Lee, Elle and Noah.
I really think people shouldn't be bashing the movie over a bad line in it.
It wasn't their brightest moment, but don't think it was on purpose, people are just taking it way too serious. Nowadays everyone mocks with everything and do a lot worse, so I really don't think there is a reason to be bashing the movie this way."
"106","The Kissing Booth 2",1,"Waste of time","The script was terrible, it was a waste of time. I can't believe Netflix even decided to waste a penny on this movie. If you're planning on watching this don't. Acting is cringe and the main couple have no chemistry between the two of them. It's just awful all around."
"107","The Kissing Booth 2",4,"It's Still Bad","But it's better than first. It's not as annoying. I still hate Elle Evans as a character though. The screenplay is bad and incredibly predictable. The main conflict is uninteresting. The gay subpolt is nice because it involves characters that aren't Elle, but they didn't really find a way to make it work so it felt really unnecessary. It was like Netflix's usual thing for including random gay characters just to prove that they're inclusive too guys. Also why does this movie have a Good Vibrations cover play at the end, that song is way too good for this trash."
"108","The Kissing Booth 2",10,"Better than the first","Very pleasantly surprised by how much I liked this movie more than the original! Usually that's not the case. But the acting felt more authentic and less cheesy in this one. Loved it! Very fun summer flick"
"109","The Kissing Booth 2",1,"waste of time","The first movie was already bad enough but I decided to give the 2nd movie a try but unfortunately it is even worse. completely wasted an hour of my life that I can never get back."
"110","The Kissing Booth 2",1,"Watched it ironically with friends to make fun of it. We are traumatised.","Full of cliches, devoid of plot or character development, and absolutely no message for teens! This movie has nothing to offer unless you want to take a shot every time someone says something cringey or does something cringeworthy."
"111","The Kissing Booth 2",NA,"IMO: better than the first.","I wasn't sure if I was going to like this one. I know it's based off of book 2 by Beth Reekles. I know the critics won't agree with me. But this seemed slightly more mature. It's YA based obviously, don't expect an adult tale. And it still maintained the spirit of the first one. Don't believe me, watch it. No spoilers in this review."
"112","The Kissing Booth 2",3,"Still bad","I didn't like the first one very much, but watched the second one anyway (my fault I guess!) I hoped it would be better but is dumb, too long (over 2 hours!) and very predictable. There was also possibly the cringiest sentence ever uttered in a romcom EVER! I'll probably still watch the 3rd one when it comes out, but only because I really hope Elle and Lee will FINAL realise how PERFECT they together as they have the best chemistry by far."
"113","The Kissing Booth 2",10,"Good movie","Those who love romantic movies it's the best choice for them and a must watch movie.Best to watch at quarantine."
"114","The Kissing Booth 2",10,"Loved it <U+2764>","Really enjoyed the first movie so I was expecting the same for the second, REALLY HAPPY. Such a good feel good film, actors are perfect for the movie. Cant wait for the 3rd<U+2764>"
"115","The Kissing Booth 2",10,"Another one please!","Liked how they didn't just do a repeat of the first one but really incorporated new plots and characters into the movie and also didn't make it 100% foreseeable. Worth watching and hope there will be a 3rd movie!"
"116","The Kissing Booth 2",10,"Definitely Worth a watch","Well, To be honest both the parts are nice. But, The second part will give you a emotional rollercoaster ride (be ready to take the ride while watching the movie :) ). It's way better in all perspectives. You'll definitely love the movie. Expecting for third part soon!"
"117","The Kissing Booth 2",10,"A very satisfying follow up","The sequel is amazing! There are so many twists and turns and you really don't know if Elle is gonna end up with Marco or Noah. There are some side stories that make you smile and the overall story is just amazing. Worth the whole 2+ hours. I WANT A 3rd one!"
"118","The Kissing Booth 2",6,"WATCH THE FILM FOR YOURSELF BEFORE COMMENTING STAN TWITTER DRAMA!","In all honestly, I know a ton of people from stan twitter are gonna come after a lot of people for reviewing this and not like what I have to say, but this is an honest review section that doesn't apply to their online platform. Caution SLIGHT SPOILER: Yes, there is one very brief scene where a distasteful joke is made about Bieber's appearance from the time he was suffering from lyme disease (an onstage amateur comedian calls out his ""trucker look""). It's a cheap shot at comedy, but not as offensive as they are making it out to be, plus it doesn't draw out and is said in a light fashion, but the scene itself is said in a stand-up comedy bar, which are KNOWN for being offensive and pushing boundaries. They are not meant to appease you or make you comfortable, its meant to be controversial and they target every person regardless of their circumstance, it's not an isolated occasion for Bieber. It's been done for literal years and it's stupid that people are flipping out over it even to the point of harassing people who weren't involved, yes seriously, people are that obsessed. It's amazing that in a film like this that carries misogynistic messages for its young viewers that people would be the most upset over this trivial thing. Mind you this was part of a montage scene so it only appears for less than TWO SECONDS and is a throwaway line so I have no idea why people are so pressed. Just because it's making fun of bieber do people (especially fangirls) feel the need to be angry about it, and no even if he was a woman (like one ""review"" stated, there would not be outrage like this), remember Britney and Lindsey in 2007? No one sticking up for them when they clearly had drug and mental health problems, these people are just hypocrites who like to complain because they are obsessed with a celebrity who doesn't know they exist. Just keep this in mind before you choose to watch or not because it is ridiculous to boycott a film like this just because you get ""offended"" over a joke that doesn't add or impact the storyline. Wish people would think for themselves and not just listen to everything twitter tells them.
Anyway, the film itself is definitely an improvement from the last one, the storyline is more compelling and the acting was definitely better, but somehow is slightly more cringey in many aspects and I think the Kissing booth theme is kind of irrelevant for this plot and left messy at the end."
"119","The Kissing Booth 2",10,"Good job!","Much better than the first movie, dynamics in story keep you going, set designs are amazing and actors are so much more refined. The story lines are great, except Ollie's storyline was either written or portrayed badly (not sure which might also just be how it was edited) but it was kinda hard to watch with these random scenes that didn't sit as well in the story as the first movie. But all in all, great movie, definitely recommended"
"120","The Kissing Booth 2",1,"unbelievable","Made fun of Justin Bieber and called him names when he was struggling w/ depression and lyme disease."
"121","The Kissing Booth 2",1,"Somehow worse than the first","At least the first one was fun to laugh and how bad it was. This one is just boring"
"122","The Kissing Booth 2",10,"Good Job!!!!","I thought that The Kissing Booth and The Kissing Booth 2 are really good movies. They are probably my favourite movies out in the filming industry. They made me cry happy tears and the acting looked so realistic that it could happen to you in real life. I really think that their should be a Kissing Booth 3 because there is going to be a To All the Boys I've Loved Before 3."
"123","The Kissing Booth 2",5,"Better than the first one, but far from perfect","I'll be honest; I went into The Kissing Booth 2 expecting it to be terrible. Instead, I got a movie that was better than the original, although that isn't saying much. It is the rare sequel that is stronger than the original, and I was pretty interested in it throughout. Elle makes some smart decisions in this movie, and each one of them is really satisfying to watch (especially tricking Marco into playing that dance game). The Elle in the original Kissing Booth wouldn't have done that, and it's nice to see how she's grown as a character. Additionally, it was hard to see where the plot was going. I never really could predict what would happen between Elle and Marco, or Elle and Noah for that matter. These are some of the things for this movie that I liked.My biggest problem with the film is that it has a terrible message for young women. Basically, Elle learns to... live for others instead of herself. Excuse me? Are you really trying to posit that a women should not' be herself, and be whatever other people want from her? It was honestly kind of disgusting. Secondly, the fact that pretty much all the people of color in this movie are disliked by the main character throughout most of the movie is also worrisome. Like yeah, eventually she warms up to them, but we still have to sit through two hours of her being suspicious of Chloe, and being annoyed with Marco. Thirdly, the characters did make some pretty stupid decisions often. For example. there's a really tiny subplot involving a guy who secretly likes another guy, but he doesn't know how to tell him. I knew from the first moment I saw them that he was romantically interested in him. However, it takes Elle way too long to figure this out, even though it was extremely obvious. These aren't all my problems with the movie, but these are just some of my biggest ones.Overall, I enjoyed the Kissing Booth 2. It was really, really flawed, but at the end of the day it's still fun. If you are feeling down, watch this movie to bring you back up."
"124","The Kissing Booth 2",9,"Drama Lama","This is a cheesy rom com movie and thats exactly why i like it. It has the romance, the drama and the friendship.
Elle' and Lee's friendship is amazing and i love it. My name is also Rachel and to be honest i really related to her haha.
Overal great movie with what you could expect."
"125","The Kissing Booth 2",7,"F.U.N!","There are so many reasons to enjoy this sequel, one being that the female lead has such a likeable character. She's fun, quirky and really believable. I find that the movie has multiple relatable situations that I think many of us have experienced at one point or another in our lives. It had a good storyline and message regaring how young adults fall under pressure figuring out their uncertain future. All in all it was a smiling, enjoyable, decent movie to watch on a Friday night. It's as good as you can get for an American teenage romcom."
"126","The Kissing Booth 2",1,"even more irritating than the first one","The filmmaking isn't as bad as the other one but that's not gonna save this terrible movieand even worse it's 2 HOURS LONG!i'm still trying to figure out how did that guy just casually pulls out an acoustic guitar out of nowhere"
"127","The Kissing Booth 2",2,"WASTE OF 2 HOURS","This movie is the complete opposite of the first one. The first one I would give a 9/10. This movie was so bad! Could not tell what the plot was the entire time. Everything was so random. Not heartwarming like the first one. Literally trash. Atleast they have two really attractive actors in it. That is what kept me watching for the entire 2 hours of this terrible movie. I would never recommend watching this movie to anyone. The lessons of it are very bad and young brains should not learn these ways of life. All in all, # 2 on my list of worst movies I have ever seen following Hereditary."
"128","The Kissing Booth 2",10,"Total entertainment","It's just a perfect entertainer. Even though It's all expected twists and turns I love the movie!! Was waiting for this sequel actually!"
"129","The Kissing Booth 2",9,"Just as good as the first one","Loved the story, the music, and the cast was perfect!!! 2 hours of just fun. Easy fun."
"130","The Kissing Booth 2",1,"Disrespectful","This movie mocks Lyme disease, as you can see when he mentions Justin Bieber. Awful movie, very disappointed"
"131","The Kissing Booth 2",1,"Trash bc joking a disease.","Justin Bieber was dealing with depression and the effects of his disease... why this trash movie need to joking about it?"
"132","The Kissing Booth 2",1,"Offensive","How disrespectful of them to mock a disease! Using Justin's illness for clout, they should be ashamed!"
"133","The Kissing Booth 2",9,"Nice!!!","It's good you should definitely watch it but it's kind of confusing already so I would suggest if you haven't watched kissing booth. Watch it before you watch this movie. Wouldn't recommend for little kids, this movie is more for teens and tweens. I really like the the new characters and the new storyline. And I'm waiting for kissing booth 3 already because they are AMAZING movies already"
"134","The Kissing Booth 2",7,"Kissing 2","I think this was a cute movie just like the first one..The actors still look too old to be playing teenagers. All of them are in their 20's and look it....still this was a cute rom com. I enjoyed it...."
"135","The Kissing Booth 2",9,"Cute and so spot on with long distance.","Cute and feel good movie. I will definitely watch it again.Sad that the comedian joked about JB but that's how comedians get content or anyone in that matter. I guess that there's a fine line between having a laugh and having a dig. I wish people could tell the difference."
"136","The Kissing Booth 2",1,"Insensitive comment about Bieber's Lyme","In one scene, the characters made fun of Justin Bieber's appearance. That was ridiculously insensitive considering that he his all ears CD was resultant of treatment for Lyme."
"137","The Kissing Booth 2",1,"Disgusting","Is heartbreaking to watch people mocking u because of ur disease Justin bieber doesn't choose to be Lyme disease victim that line on the movie is sooo unnecessary I'm so disappointed"
"138","The Kissing Booth 2",4,"Terrible Script","This film is just written so wrong the the actors in it can only do their best which they do. It wasn't very interesting was bored in the first 20 minutes but it made me cry."
"139","The Kissing Booth 2",8,"I mean what do you even expect?","It's a teen rom-com, it had everything that happens in it. NGL, THIS MOVIE MADE ME CRY AT SOME POINTS. And i liked it's part 1 and this one too. Idk why the reviews are so harsh?"
"140","The Kissing Booth 2",1,"Bad movie","Making fun of Justin Bieber's appearance while he was sick and diagnosed with Lyme Disease!! This is the worst thing"
"141","The Kissing Booth 2",1,"Made an account to review this","Incredibly horrible movie. Was dragged to watch it. Unbearably unrealistic dialogue. No grasp whatsoever of human communication. Over saturated hues make me want to go blind. Overly dramatic characters with the acting talent of a Sasquatch. Please do not watch."
"142","The Kissing Booth 2",1,"Worst Movie Ever","I have never written a review before but I had to sign up and write this. This is most likely the worst movie ever made on planet earth. The acting is horrible and cringey and the script is almost worse. Not to mention Joey Kong's wig is atrocious."
"143","The Kissing Booth 2",1,"Terrible","This movie it's just as cringy as the first one. The stoyline was awful and the script was just pitiful. It made many ""jokes"" that were just extremely distasteful not to mention insensitive."
"144","The Kissing Booth 2",10,"Beautiful movie","I think the movie was amazing just as the first one, and it really catches you"
"145","The Kissing Booth 2",8,"It was nice as a follow-up","It's a good enough sequel from the first movie. It's just something that you watch when you wanna feel good. It's nice."
"146","The Kissing Booth 2",1,"Disgusting for them to mock about someone's appearance when he was dealing with depression, anxiety and a freakin disease!","Mocking about Justin Bieber's appearance shouldn't be someone to put into a freaking movie. He IS dealing with a disease that unfortunately made him appear like that just a year ago. But apart from a disease, he was dealing with depression and anxiety and another illness which is mono and makes you really tired. Disgusting. This is a movie for teenagers. You don't even think about what you teach to those. (It cannot be a movie for young adult because lol, it is THAT BAD). Disgusting."
"147","The Kissing Booth 2",4,"The Kissing Booth 2 - Movie Review","The Kissing Booth wasn't a great film, but it was enjoyable and I had a good time watching it. I still had a number of problems with the film, and those negatives are unfortunately amplified in the sequel.The narrative in the first film wasn't anything special, but it's quite poor in the sequel. I didn't really care about what happened, and it was far too stretched out. The sequel clocks in at almost half an hour longer than the first film, and that extra time makes the pacing wobbly.Fortunately, the saving grace of the film is the dynamic between the characters. I enjoyed watching all of them on-screen, especially Joey King as Elle. It's just a shame that the screenplay they had to work with was sloppy and full of rom-com tropes that have been done much better in other films.The other problem I had with the first film is the way they sexualised El and made her fall over her feet for the stereotypical hot guy. This isn't quite as distracting in the sequel, but it's definitely still there and it's very off-putting in the way it's handled.The film also isn't funny. I barely smiled, mainly because it used a lot of slapstick humour. That's not something that I find funny, because anyone can fall over or cause an accident. I much prefer actual wit within the screenplay, but that wasn't present here.I am being very harsh on this film, but it's not complete garbage. Like I said, the dynamic between the characters is strong, the cinematography is nice, and it's edited well. The soundtrack was also catchy, but the songs aren't as well incorporated into the story as they were in the first film.Whilst there are some redeeming qualities to The Kissing Booth 2, and I can't deny that the last twenty minutes managed to bring it up a notch, there are way too many issues and the long runtime made it a chore to get through. If you liked the first film then you might get some enjoyment from this one, but I wouldn't recommend it.SCORE: 40%"
"148","The Kissing Booth 2",1,"Why does this exist?","A film that takes advantage of naive and hormonal teenagers or maybe just a desperate way to make money, either way this movie sucks. Visually it doesn't innovate at all, most of the film we can only see static shots of the characters who are talking at the moment. The Color Palette seems synthetic, there always seems to be a perfect climate, and it lacks movement.The story, like its predecessor lacks character, is, as I mentioned, a cheap re color from another film, without adding anything new to the plot. Many of us have already seen it, and we are tired of seeing the classic romantic cliché adapted to the time, with very forced jokes that end up being uncomfortable, and with that so hypocritical attempt of LGTB ""inclusion"", that more than integrating it in an organic way, it seems only to want to make a show of it.How believable this story is, I mean, the girl gets upset in the first place because she thinks she's been cheated on, and so she decides... to do the same thing? It's because of this normalized toxicity that real relationships don't work afterwards, and I say this mostly as a social criticism, do we really want boys and girls to idealize these kinds of romances?The characters don't seem to learn from their mistakes and fall back into them again and again. Jealousy is the main character in this sequel, the protagonist jealous of her boyfriend, going so far as to check her phone without his permission, (which unleashed many misunderstandings) the best friend's girlfriend practically forbidding his friendship with the protagonist, just out of jealousy, and in short, I don't give any more thought to the subject, which is already sounding repetitive"
"149","The Kissing Booth 2",6,"A simple rom com...and that's it.","NETFLIX'S THE KISSING BOOTH 2 is enjoyable (in bit & pieces). However, it is better than the first one for sure. The leading cast looks honest and there is no overacting by anyone but the narrative is not compelling enough.It starts where the prequel left off. Noah leaving for Harvard and now, Elle has to navigate life through her senior school as she turns into a doubting girlfriend. The reason is this gorgeous looking new friend of Noah and plus, dashing new boy in her school- Marco.The biggest problem of this rom-com is its duration that makes it a long stretched affair. There are very little humor and a predictable plot that you must have seen it for at least one hundred times. Though, Taylor and Maisie are good additions. Furthermore, the newfound love between the two boys is very sweet.The movie may find its audience in the form of all the high school going kids as they can relate to all the drama happening in the movie and also, for someone who is just looking for a simple time pass without expecting anything new."

"156","The Kissing Booth 2",8,"Cute","Stop making this movie out to be less than what it is. It is a cute follow up (just as good as the first). Sure there are some plot holes, but overall this is very enjoyable."
"157","The Kissing Booth 2",1,"Netflix, what the hell?","This movie made me lose hope for Netflix. I thought the platform was compromised to make good content, but now it's filled with stupid reality shows and THIS. It makes me want to rip my eyes off."
"158","The Kissing Booth 2",7,"Easy to watch","Was enjoyable enough to watch. I assume they left it open for a third movie at the end so she can actually end up with the right guy! Her relationship is more than problematic, let's set an example, trust issues are not cool..."
"159","The Kissing Booth 2",4,"Mediocrity at its finest","Only watched for Jacob Elordi and Joel Courtney's cute ass. Lots of cliché moments and cringeworthy scenes. Honestly worse than the first one. Can't believe there's a 3rd one coming next year. Also who allowed this to be as long as it is?!?"
"160","The Kissing Booth 2",3,"Average","Just another movie that makes long distance dating harder and look impossible. Feeds right into the stereotypes that already exists."
"161","The Kissing Booth 2",4,"The Most UNORIGINAL MOVIE I've seen","So, here's the thing. It went from an opening scene just like one from 'Marley and Me'. To a plot that was resolved just like 'To All the Boys I've Loved Before'
The actual characters that have chemistry wont be together and they just try to shove a that ""destined to be together"" love between the protagonists that it's just dumb. Yes, you'll get a good humor every now and then but even then it's not enough to distract you from how predictable this movie is.
Just another normal romance movie taking bits and pieces from other movies and doesn't bring anything at all new."
"162","The Kissing Booth 2",9,"Excellent Movie","I'm in love with this Movie, i'm addicted to it and im egarly waiting for the third part<U+0001F60D><U+0001F60D>"

"164","The Kissing Booth 2",6,"Feel good movie, not too deep","Its good for when you are pmsing and want some cheesy teenage drama in your life."
"165","The Kissing Booth 2",1,"Unrealistic and unhealthy portrayal of teenage life","HAVE THEY LEARNED NOTHING FROM THE FIRST MOVIE?? i can't believe this was even worse, i honestly feel so sorry for the 13 year olds that are gonna gobble up this movie like it's free cake or something (as much as i hate to admit it, i probably would've been one of them). the way these kinds of movies depict high school is honestly just so UNHEALTHY; it's as if high school was THE MOST important part in life and as if the relationships you have in high school were the ones! that! will! define! you! for! life! which is why they're obviously complete life-and-death situations!
the characters are so unrealistic and pretentious, and the dialogues (unsurprisingly) made me feel uncomfortable as hell. i bet the casting call for marco was just ""must look exactly like jacob elordi with darker hair"".
and don't even get me started on the MONTAGES. it's almost as if at some point they ran out of cringy dialogues, so they just opted for cringy montages with even cringier music instead. I ABSOLUTELY LOST IT AT THE MONTAGE OF ALL THE ADMISSION OFFICERS READING ELLE'S ESSAY AND LOOKING LIKE THEY JUST INHALED A FRESH BREEZE OF MOUNTAIN AIR, SAW THE BLUEST SKY, HAD THEIR SOULS CLEANSED AND REDISCOVERED THEIR WILL TO LIVE."
"166","The Kissing Booth 2",3,"A predictable escapist fantasy that falls flat on its face.","The first kissing booth is by no means any masterpiece of cinema, but this takes it to an all new level. I knew it would be bad, but not this badFirst of all, I am floored that the runtime hasn't been brought up as often as it has been. It's too long. But this is made worse by there being no surprised or interesting character developments. Elle in particular became even more unlikable in this movie (and she was already on thin ice in the first movie due to her behavior.) Also, I started really questioning if some events were happy at all, but the music seems to paint them in this way.So why a 3 instead of a 1?I think that were this director kill off this story line and make a new (shorter) movie, it could do well, because this movie does show signs of progress in a couple of ways. The beginning is pretty fun, much like the first movie, but doesn't try to win shallow sympathy points for the protagonist. Lee is also not quite as bad in this movie as the previous. Some of the few jokes in this movie land better than the original too.It's not even worth an ironic watch, believe me I tried. The runtime ruins that."
"167","The Kissing Booth 2",6,"It's good","Kissing Booth 2 is a good movie in my opinion, maybe for other people it is not, but I love romantic movies and youthful loves. My favorite part was when Elle decided to solve all the problems in her life and think about what she really wanted and follow her dreams despite all the problems.However, I hate when she kissed Marco because I look forward to it despite the fact that he helped her in everything and sincerely loved her, he is the guy we all love but sometimes we do not know how to value him.I consider that she was a lucky woman because having had two exceptional men who loved her, however, she was a determined person and fought for what she wantedIt wasn't as good as the first one but it met my expectations as a public"
"168","The Kissing Booth 2",4,"Wasn't expecting a masterpiece, but this just wasn't good.","The first Kissing Booth was enjoyable to watch and had a clear plot even if it was cheesy. I feel that the second film cannot quite for this description. The plot of the film is very weak and the writing could have been better. Some voiceover was just reiterating points we already got from the visual aspects and already developed concepts. When it comes to the characters you don't see any development in them at all. Other than that It was nice to see a gay couple in the film, however there was no real backstory or real story line to the characters. They felt like a quick add in to the film to make Netflix more inclusive. The acting was often sub par at best and quite a few of outdoor shots especially could have been much better in exposure and more. I also found the soundtrack to be lacking and some covers were not pleasing! I was expecting the film to not be amazing but I was disappointed. The film feels like people liked the first one so they just threw out a sequel."
"169","The Kissing Booth 2",1,"One statement can ruin the whole movie","It will never be a good thing to make fun of someone else's appearance either a celebrity or not.

We need this kind of romantic film right now. I liked the first movie but this one's actually better. It's predictable but would still keep you wondering chapter by chapter. You would feel things making you feel that you're still human.
2 hours -- NOT waste of time especially if you want to feel so good after watching a movie. Go, watch it now!"

"201","The Old Guard",7,"Almost","Love the concept, execution is not bad (there are some cringy & forced parts), but the music really annoys me. Doesn't fit the tone of the film at all."
"202","The Old Guard",5,"Lost potential","There were just so many clichés, cringe, and naive moments. The dialogue was also simple. The music was not all that good. The antagonist had a cartoonish evil character."
"203","The Old Guard",5,"Great potential. Ultimately mediocre","I really wanted to like this film. It's got a simple but fun premise and it's got Charlize Theron, who's a fantastic actress. But the film is just marred by plot holes, cliched characters, tacky dialogues and hands down the most inadequate music possible for this film.It's still a passable action film if you have absolutely nothing else to watch."
"204","The Old Guard",9,"Loved it, I'm praying for a sequel or series.","I didn't read the comic so I went in blind. I loved it. The story, the action, the fight scenes. Thoroughly enjoyed the movie. I hope they have a sequel or series."
"205","The Old Guard",3,"Meh","Disappointing. Looks like a lazy film made for TV, aiming mostly at a teenage audience. Not even a scratch on Atomic Blonde and Mad Max, two others Charlize's action films, which are in a different league to this mediocrity."
"206","The Old Guard",9,"Fun movie","I'm a little surprised at the bad ratings here. Seems wildly polarized between the bottom and top.
Short: I thought it was a well executed rendition of a graphic novel and I'm looking forward to the next."
"207","The Old Guard",5,"Boring and cheap looking","An intriguing concept that they don't do much with. Average action scenes but lots of blood. Feels like it could have done with another couple of drafts and some extra writers. Chief bad guy was overacting and a bit rubbish. My main fault was that it just looked cheap - more like a TV show than a big movie."
"208","The Old Guard",9,"Entertaining, bad ass acting and good fun!","Why why why so many haters?! First thing I thought was ""wow"" what a great sound track! Cinematographery is on point - nothing missed. Charlize Theron is bad ass for sure! Okay, so there are the odd over the top moments like the endless supply of security guards that just keep on coming. But that aside, all in all, thoroughly entertaining, original and full of action! 10/10 from me! Can't wait for The Old Guard 2!"
"209","The Old Guard",5,"Bloodless.","I'm stunned. How can a topic that exciting be executed that boringly? It's a dull movie. Camera work, scenery, editing: uninspired. And that is already the kindest word I can think of. The setup takes way to long. The actors have very little to work with.
Go watch Highlander, instead."
"210","The Old Guard",6,"mediocre","The premise was good, but they didn't got to do something interesting with it. It was kind of a bore all the way. Also, the soundtrack is one of the worst I've ever witnessed in a movie."
"211","The Old Guard",5,"Tis No Highlander","Not bad but not great either. It's watchable but a tad bland. The script probably needed a couple more rewrites. 5/10"
"212","The Old Guard",8,"Agree it's the same ol stuff but it is highly entertaining n action packed.","As this film is based on a comic book, similarities r inevitable but it is a solid action thriller.
A short summary - A small group of centuries old soldiers who r trapped in an immortality with the ability to heal themselves must save each other from being caged by big pharma companies. They soon realize that it is harder to hide in this 21st century and so must get organized to erase their footprints but at the same time deal with past grievances.The cinematography n editing r top notch. There is no shaky cam or darkly shot scenes. The hand to hand combat n gun fight sequences r noteworthy.
Charlize Theron is in awesome shape and all the other actors gave good performances.
Another highlight is the music."
"213","The Old Guard",8,"Thoroughly enjoyable - except the soundtrack","Really loved the action, the acting and the melancholy feel to it all, much better than just an average action flick, except unfortunately for the incredibly stupid and jarring popsongs which ruin some scenes. Please please please just a decent score for (hopefully) part two. Other than that, really no complaints."
"214","The Old Guard",1,"Watchable but terrible terrible music","Really annoying music, movie not terrible nor good"
"215","The Old Guard",3,"Yeah, sorry, it's woke. There, i said it.","I wasn't going to write my thoughts after i saw this film, as i usually don't bother to do that. But now it has been a couple of days, and this movie has been eating at me for a little bit, so i felt i had to say what needed to be said.Listen, there is so much woke talk going around these days, woke is the new PC (Political correctness), and i do not immediately draw conclusions just because a movie has a female leading role. Some of the best movies i have ever seen has leading females. For example Alien, Aliens, Terminator 2 and Kill Bill. And, i also really liked Mad Max Fury road, in which Charlize was the leading role, and made Hardy look like a movie extra.I love great movies, with a great story, with a great script, great direction, great acting, great cinematography, great music, great cgi. I love movies that can deliver greatness. This is why my top ten movies and tv series of all time is 12 Angry men, Schindler's List, Pulp Fiction, The Shawshank Redemption, Alien, Das Boot, Apocalypse now, Band of Brothers, Breaking Bad and The Wire.I have seen over 3000 movies in my life, and i have even worked as a movie critic. But of course, my opinion is just subjective like anyone else's, I'm just mentioning this, because i do have some experience with this.Anyways, to try and keep all my points short. This movie has lots of bad acting in it, which is quite shocking when you look at some of the cast. The villain is dull and the story is a mess. And on the flip side we have a carefully balanced cast of white, black, middle eastern and Asian actors, and also two male characters that just happens to be gay.Listen.. I have seen brokeback mountain, it's a really good film. I grew up watching Jackie Chan and Bruce Lee movies which i love to this day, i am not homophobe, or a racist, or a sexist. All i want, is great movies.What defines a great movie? Well that is of course up to anyone to find out for themselves. But when a movie is so obviously designed around political correctness, the movie as a whole will suffer. Why? Because when your goal is to include as much LGBQT as possible, the story itself comes second. And if the movie isn't founded in cement, everything else will fall apart.What i think is weird, is how high this movie is rated, it is only 5 points behind Terminator 2. Just NO! It is 1 point ahead of Kill Bill.. NO! This movie is not even in spitting distance of those two films. Yet still, critics seem to love it.This is evidence of woke, i am so sorry, but it is. There is just no other way of describing it. I have seen this movie, i went in with an open heart as always, and I'm just left with this empty feeling inside of what did i just watch. Bad directing, bad acting, bad script, forced LGBQT story, absolutely horribly bad villain. I shake my head in disbelief, and it is higher rated than kill bill.... ok then.. And another example, it's also higher rated than Se7en and Joker. Yeah no, nope nope nope. I don't care about subjectivity anymore, we are living in a world now, where certain forces are at play, messing up peoples brain.What this movie has, is some cool action scenes, but even those become dull before we reach the half-way mark. Just an endless slaughter of stunt men in black armor gear. Can it be more dull? No.. It can't.In Kill Bill, at least we had Quentin Tarantino at the helm, who carefully crafted each scene, and made action scenes that are among some of the best ever filmed. But Gina Prince-Bythewood is no Quentin Tarantino, to put it mildly. The action is generic, predictable and dull..... So this movie doesn't work as an action movie either. And this sort of deep story they try to weave through the entire thing, about Charlize's loss and how she has suffered, and what she has been through. It doesn't work, they failed. And it is actually because their focus is in the wrong place.This movie is bad.
3/10. Stay way."
"216","The Old Guard",2,"Wow...this is so bad.","Feels like amateur hour. Script, dialogue, score and most of all directing are all awful!"
"217","The Old Guard",6,"Worth a watch, but needs a better written sequel.","This was fun, and something new to watch in lockdown. Should it be one of Netflix's most popular film commissions of all time? No. And here's why ...The movie was thrown a tonne of money at it, and while the source material is solid and Charlize Theron is as dependable as ever in the lead role, the screenplay and some supporting cast members fail to hit the mark.An engrossing concept: (near) immortal soldiers out to do good, yet constantly tortured by their own gift, but with pacing issues and a weakly cast villain, the movie can only go so far.Harry Melling, as billionaire nut-job Stephen Merrick, is simply put - quite annoying, and not menacing as the film's primary nemesis to Charlize's Andy. New recruit Nile, played by Kiki Lane, just lacks the gravitas to convince the viewer that she's the next badass in line to take over Theron's mantle.There are killer scenes in the film though, as Andy's squad take on various low-lives with fluidity and elegance that makes the fight scenes a pleasure to watch. But while these entertain, some of the dialogue between contorts the film into a less enjoyable romp.Chiwetel Ejiofor brings a level of class to rectify these issues and lends the whole film promise - perhaps this could be the start of something more appetising. It has so much promise, let's hope that this can lead on to greater things for the centuries-old group of mercenaries."
"218","The Old Guard",4,"A Slowish and Plain Action Movie","I kinda went into this expecting it to be like a ""popcorn, action summer"" movie but I found it really boring.It moves at such a sluggish pace for the first hour then it kinda picks up its pace but by then you don't really care.That is another big issue is that the characters are very paper thin for the most part. Its main take no nonsense lady, man, man, man and new girl. They are complete characters descriptions of the main cast. Charlize's characters is more developed with a deeper backstory but the others are so interchangeable and forgettable.The action scenes are well choreographed but I found the sound effects a bit too much like every time a sword or axe was used it would make a cartoon ""swoosh"" sound which I get it but I think it could have been tone down a little bit.It's not like terrible and you could probably watch it if you are really board but I wouldn't carve out 2 hours to watch it.Oh yeah it's 2 hours 5 minutes long which is too long and definitely has scenes that could have been left on the cutting room floor to tighten it up."
"219","The Old Guard",8,"Good Action-Movie","Actually a Great Action-Movie with good Fights and a Lot of Violence !The Story is good and there is a lot of Potential for 1-2 Sequels and i seriously hope they make themCharlize Theron just doen´t get old it seems, that Woman is abssolutly Bad-Ass !My Biggest Point Of Criticism is the Musik in the Movie, so freaking annoying and just bad, bad, bad , sorry, but that was seriously the biggest turn-off for me while watching the movieAll in All, Great Action, Good Story, Lots Of Potencial for Sequel(s) , good Acting but horrible Choice of Music in the Movie8 / 10Greetings From Germany"
"220","The Old Guard",1,"Don't waste your time","This is a really cheap TV movie with a couple of big names in it."
"221","The Old Guard",2,"One lousy film","Terrible plot, lousy script, rotten acting and one of the worst soundtracks I've heard. Seriously B-grade rubbish. Don't waste your time."
"222","The Old Guard",8,"Doesn't quite live up to the Graphic Novel, but still good enough","If you have read the Graphic Novel before watching this, you are likely going to be disappointed because the novel is so much better.It is grander, Andy is more bad as*, more flashbacks about their old life, and the action scenes are much more spectacular.If you haven't read the novel and just watched this, I think you will still find it entertaining enough though. And I would highly recommend that you get the Graphic Novel afterwards."
"223","The Old Guard",2,"Tediously explores social issues, while shortchanging plot and character development","That an action film should be exciting seems axiomatic -- so trite as to hardly bear mentioning. However, The Old Guard is more often an exercise in tedium interrupted by mindless action scenes we've seen done before and better.The plot is a mash-up of elements from Highlander and Coronet Blue, a television series from the 1960s, with a dash of shared dreams from Inception. However, as with many current films, the filmmakers seem more interested in exploring social issues than character and plot development.Much of the screen time is devoted to the dramatic question of whether a black female can be a superhero. Of course, this can't be somebody who is just black enough to seem exotically ethnic, with the manners, sophistication, education, and polish of an upper-middleclass suburbanite; but a tough, streetwise, dark-complexioned, cornrow-coifed war veteran who's a bit rough around the edges.So much time and attention is devoted to the training and inculcation of this new recruit, that potentially more interesting elements in the script are given short shrift. One character has an existential dilemma, which is never resolved. An intriguing element concerning the fate of a former member of the team is never resolved, despite the team's paranormal ability to share dreams, but is inexplicably revisited in a postscript scene during the credits.There is no B-story to give the movie emotional depth. The only romance is a homosexual relationship between two of the team members which may offend some, but will leave most viewers disinterested. There are several pitched gunfights with evil minions dressed in full tactical gear with helmets and balaclavas, who are dispatched with surfeit of bullets but minimal bloodshed, and about as much emotional impact as decommissioning robots.Charlize Theron was quoted recently criticizing Steven Seagal's fight sequences and suggesting that her own were more realistic and intense. For action-film fans, one criterion for evaluating action scenes is the length of the shots. In JCVD, Jean-Claude Van Damme does a three-minute scene involving numerous weapons and opponents, shot in one take. That's impressive. TOG employs a lot of quick cuts which only require the performers to master one move. The fights are fairly good, but Pale compared to movies like The Raid and Banlieue 13 (District B13), or the films of Tony Jaa, Jackie Chan and Jason Stratham.The filmmakers seem so concerned with being woke, that they neglect to make the film exciting, rewarding, intriguing or cathartic."
"224","The Old Guard",1,"Unwatchable","This B-movie directed by an amateur has a horrible soundtrack you only will find pleasing when you never had the chance to develop a taste.The super star you love from Fury Road has a boyish haircut that makes her even more unlikable than a missing limb and baldness.One of the opening scenes is her (Charlize Theron's) buddies betting on her being able to name the ingredients of a piece of pastry she eats. Who cares? Not me. Does it do something for the plot, story, or character development? Of course not. There is no meaningful dialogue either. Nothing makes the viewer want to find out why these people have Wolverine's healing powers.Here is a tip for making a scene believable: When a crew of mercenaries gets shot down in an ambush and starts moving again in a room full of enemies, one will notice. And a lot of gory head shooting would ensue. Not a melee dominated by wonky pseudo martial-arts, which unfortunately was depicted.Not even an extra star due to production value for this hot garbage."
"225","The Old Guard",1,"One of the worst i have watched in 2020","Netflix really dropped the ball here.
Terrible writing, terrible effects, terrible directing, terrible soundtrack and so much more.Take out some of the prominent ""woke"" politics within the movie, its still a terrible movie.We were given little to no background on these amazing characters which left me wandering why they even mentioned how old they are.The whole thing felt cheap and lacking in most places. I really am shicked its received some high reviews as i honestly thought about turning it off about 40 mins in, very predictable story.
Honestly dont waste your time. I wish i hadnt."
"226","The Old Guard",2,"Progressive trash","Of course the white males in the movie are all the villains (the straight ones). Movie is long and super slow in the middle. The fight scenes are so UNBELIEVABLE, I have an automatic weapon but let me first move up to within arms reach of you. So many plot holes as well but if you can turn your brain off for a minute you can finish it."
"227","The Old Guard",1,"Predictable, too much social messaging, boring","Boring, predictable, bad acting, unwanted social messaging. What a waste of time."
"228","The Old Guard",7,"Entertaining","I always like my villains bad as hell. The adversary here was not terrifying, at all. With that said, this movie was entertaining. Maybe Charlize Theron makes up for the downsides. She is awesome."
"229","The Old Guard",2,"Wokelander.....","We all remember ""Highlander"". It was an instant classic; memorable, heartfelt, romantic, exciting, fantastic soundtrack.......Well ""The Old Guard"" is its antithesis. Its a brittle tale of justification for globalist Western meddling, social justice, politics of sexuality and more. Once again, the story has been mostly fogotten. It wanders around a bit, has a predictable twist and finally falls flat on its face.The action scenes are fine, as is the acting but these are only ingredients and in this case the ""mix"" is very wrong.I hope and pray this is the first and last of these. That said, it looks like they are gearing up for a second round of tiresome lecturing. I can only imagine what that will be like because I wont be watching it.......2/10."
"230","The Old Guard",6,"Nothing special... perhaps okay if you want a brainless action movie.","This movie had a lot of potential to be a masterpiece. Sadly, it came cliched with the same action sequence and course of events, that have been going on since the 90s. After perhaps mid way through the movie i sadly lost interest, it just seemed that it was a very simple action flick with a very straight forward story and blunt characters.
There have been some really great action movies recently like and I was expecting either a action sequence something like ""Extraction""or a great story. I must say I am a little disappointed when i saw the movie after the trailer."
"231","The Old Guard",1,"Typical Netflix trash","Boring, clumsy action, you could tell it was filmed on a budget."
"232","The Old Guard",5,"It's OK for what it is","This has the look and feel of something put together by the numbers. There's a comedy British CEO megalomaniac villain (minus the comedy), a tough-as-nails lead harbouring secrets, PTSD etc, and a newbie who has to learn the ropes and save the day.It's competently put together. The performances are acceptable rather than outstanding. The action sequences are OK. Chiwetel Ejiofor does the best he can with a subpar script and Charlize Theron's sharp haircut distracts.Probably a film for a quiet weekend when you've something else to do and need some background noise you can dip in and out of."
"233","The Old Guard",7,"Good, but silly story.","This good have been the Highlander of the 20's
Good fight scenes,good actors.
However,the story is line is so dissapointing and predictable.
That over the top evil bad guy,...c'mon,what a wast of potential.
Mixed feelings about this one. Still,very entertaining.
I hope for part 2 ,with better writers.
7/10"
"234","The Old Guard",7,"Entertaining, would have been a better series","Easy viewing, great fight choreography and action scenes. The plot was simply and predictably executed but remained entertaining throughout. Great individual performances but would of been better as a series to allow for some proper character development."
"235","The Old Guard",8,"I enjoyed it","Surprisingly being a silly childhood imagination of not being dead and become a superhero, this movie is a well made action packed one. I enjoyed it till end. Some of the parts reminded me of many movies and even animated shorts. If you have similar childhood imaginations and love some action watch it. I'm expecting a second part. Good acting by all. Overall good experience."
"236","The Old Guard",8,"Excited to see more","I really don't understand the bad vibes about the music. I liked it just fine. I have not read the comics but figured it must be based on one. This would probably be better as a series than a movie. There's too much to tell in one movie. I'm looking forward to the next one."
"237","The Old Guard",7,"21st century Highlander","Never read the comics, so went in blind. I found it a good fun movie, couple of bits were too slow, but apart from that very enjoyable. Charlize Theron was great in the lead as were the other immortals, but the baddie didn't do anything for me, acted like a spoilt teen. Looking forward to the sequel. P.S. They need to sort out the music."
"238","The Old Guard",5,"It's okkkk","Worth a watch I guess's.....The action is fine it's just very choppy at times.The film does struggle with character development, makes it difficult to care about what you are watching sometimes.But by far the biggest problem is this film has one of the worst villains in film history... It's just god awful.
He is like a cross between a scientist and someone from the social network hybrid.
Just makes me cringe watching him....."
"239","The Old Guard",1,"Oh. My. God.","How this movie received solid reviews from critics is beyond me. It's predictable, and poorly executed. The motives that sway the character's decisions are flimsy at best, laughable in truth. The ending is awful, the writing is poor and mundane. I'm honestly flabbergasted. Honestly, I'm giving it a one because someone needs to balance out the fact that anyone would give this a 6+ review."
"240","The Old Guard",10,"Love it needs a sequel or series...","Completely in love with the movie, it's going to be one of those types of movies that I rewatch time and time again."
"241","The Old Guard",2,"Do yourselves a favour and avoid","Bad story, bad script, bad action scenes, bad directing and above all seriously bad acting especially the woman who was plays a marine. Please, please, please find another career that you are actually capable of doing above the level of total failure.
Charlie Theron, surely can't be in such need of a pay day. The public know that your a quality actress, why lower yourself and reputation to appear in such utter dross."
"242","The Old Guard",1,"very bad dont waste your time","Very bad don't waste your time, many rushed scene unplanned and unreasonable, many holes in plot many predictable moves please dont make a second one..."
"243","The Old Guard",8,"Army of immortals !","Good action thriller. Starting with hostage drama rescue operation preparation but when in action it is a twist that takes you another twist that the army is immortal. We think the story is kind of different till first half ends. Some jolts you never expect in first half but later half is going very usual. Charlie Theron is perfect in her 'Andy's role. Here she looks like Ruby Rose in John Wick 2 and perhaps second time with black hair after firstly in ' Eion Flux'. Later half is less interested and predictable not any twist except last scene. I wish more sequels. Overall movie is enjoyable for action lovers especially who likes kick ass fights."
"244","The Old Guard",1,"Stupidity to the max","The concept of the story is acceptable, but the script and dialogues are excruciatingly unbearable. I almost gave up after the first 30 minutes but then I thought Theron couldn't have agreed to do such a horrendous movie. Boy was I wrong, everyone looked so lifeless and forced except Kiki/Nile, it's like they knew how bad the final product would be and they were somewhat apologetic. This is not one of those it's so bad it's good movies so don't waste your time. If any time you find this movie unbearable don't wait, nothing worthy is going to happen, just turn off the TV or watch something else."
"245","The Old Guard",3,"Watch Highlander instead","Cons.
Direction is cringeworthy especially pop songs over action sequences reminds me of daredevil.Some pretty poor acting from the young actress, very pedestrian.Dialogue is the worst I've seen in many years, just awful.Pros.
Concept is good even thougbits basically Hoghlander ( due for a remake ).It's on Netflix so you can turn it off if you don't like it ."
"246","The Old Guard",2,"Unrelatable character, too clean and PC","Sorry, couldn't watch more than 25 minutes of this film...
The entire movie looked too clean.
None of the characters were relatable to me at all.
Once again I felt like someone was trying to force PC down my throat.
I read that a lot of people thought the acting was great? Please tell me 'when' this was the case? It surely wasn't in the first 25 minutes.
I really wanted to like this movie, but was sadly disappointed."
"247","The Old Guard",1,"Lame, boring, wannabe fake john wick movie","Worst acting, boring movie. No story line, want to copy action from john wick movies, the characters are like zombies, no life. Like a bunch of homeless people together want to make the world a better place, and their leader is fit for the mental hospital."
"248","The Old Guard",9,"Great action film","Loved the film. Much better than a lot of the average action films coming out. I hope they make another!"
"249","The Old Guard",4,"Average No-Brainer","Ifd your one of those people who like a movie wirh a deeper meaning, DON'T watch this :-)It's full of plotholes, meaningless decisions, stupid dialouge, and mediocre action.If you like a 'No-Brainer movie' you should watch it.I'm a in-betweener. Sometimes I like stupid action movies, other times a really 'good story movie'. :-)"
"250","The Old Guard",1,"A total waste of time","Cringe worthy.
Nothing but old cliches of immortality themed action movies along the history of movie making.
Charlize will want to forget this as it offers her most lackluster performance. Totally wooden.
I haven't read the comics but if this is true to the comics than the comics is garbage as well.
I am so desperately yearning for more original thought provoking sci-fi/fantasy but I am truly afraid that today we have forgotten to dream new dreams and can only rehash the precedent dreams and nightmares of others..."
"251","The Old Guard",1,"Don't waste your time","Boring, predictable, slow. I forced myself to watch it till half. Definitely the worst movie played by Charlize Theron."
"252","The Old Guard",1,"Who does these initial reviews","I had to suffer 20 minutes of this cheap cliche cuz the imdb rating was 8.5. Where infact it shouldn't even be 5.8. Weak and predictable story line, cheap heroism and poorly acted garbage."
"253","The Old Guard",2,"Lost potential","Awesome concepts but what is that story? Too many forced and cringy moments to count. I watched because of the plot ideas and high reviews which are currently overrated. Would give it a honest rating of 5 but the counterweight is needed."
"254","The Old Guard",1,"A waste of your time.Bad bad bad bad","No option to rate less than 1.
It gets worse as it approaches the end and would advise you not to bother.
A total waste of time, unless for the new young generation maybe, who are used of watching this sort of cr@p. Nothing else to add it's just a really bad movie badly put together and badly executed. Who these people think they are going to entertain with this??
Much prefer doing any other activity instead. Could carry on forever and tell you everything i didn't like but don't want to bore you and to be honest this is not even worth writing about.
Do not waste your time go for a walk or do anything you like instead you will thank me later.
Very disappointed and sad to think that Netflix thinks this is good enough. Sorry but no it's not.
What else do you want me to say about this thing movie, there is nothing else to say it's bad. Bad directing , average acting, even worse script.
Bad dialogue, bad cinematography, bad music, bad bad"
"255","The Old Guard",2,"Wow","This is so cringy and bad lol. Like it was written and directed by a 12yr old haha. Wth is this? There's either thousands of paid bots from Netflix or people are taking it easy on trash like this cause it's essentially free if you have Netflix, either way it's laughably bad."
"256","The Old Guard",1,"Absolute garbage!","Boring! Cheap! Bad acting! Makes no sense.
Netflix cancel good TV series to make terrible films like this."
"257","The Old Guard",8,"What action movies r meant to be.","The action and the fighting scenes were great! They choreographed the fighting perfectly"

I remember watching 2 old tv shows with kind of the same stuff, some guys which are old af and they dont die.Action is fine, combat scenes pretty awesome, missed story potential but its ok overall :).What I don't like: forced gay scene is forced AF and female empowerment, like usual.We don't need those.. but its netflix"
"259","The Old Guard",4,"Good idea, marred by silly ideas","The old guard are a group of soldiers who are old because they are immortal. Get it? It's an interesting premise, ruined by weak characters and the usual Hollywood cliches.We are treated to a number of liberal tropes in which virtue is portrayed as evil, and truth is portrayed as a lie. For example, the ultimate bad guy in this movie is... wait for it... Big pharmaceutical! We watch the lead immortal soldiers scoffing at the idea that God exists while ironically expecting us in the audience to believe there's really such a thing as an immortal soldier. And of course, two of the main male characters declare their undying love gay for each other and make out on camera. So very woke.If only there was a well developed likable character in this movie. The lead soldier played by Charlize Theron is compelling but flat. Even in the end, when she gives her existential exposition about the difficulties of becoming mortal again, it's hard to connect because, after all, I've never been I'm mortal! Nile is a new soldier to the group, and definitely likable. But her character doesn't really have much of a story arc so we don't get to see her develop or overcome anything significant.Plus there's tons of gore , shooting, hacking, etc. Unless you really love that kind of stuff, it's probably not worth your time."
"260","The Old Guard",1,"Quite boring and pointless","Lets be abundantly clear. This movie is sold on charlize Theron,make no doubt a bout it.
Why though I have no idea cause she really isn't all that.The biggest problem I have with it,is the pace.It's to slow for being a good action movie. And you don't sympathize with any of he characters. They actually bore you to death.
Another thing. They suppose to be hunting someone who is hunting them,but they're not really putting an effort into it. Yet he has no problem finding them. over an over."
"261","The Old Guard",1,"Boring and Politically Correct - how could that be?","I'm going to take it on trust that the second hour is as bad or worse than the first, we couldn't even finish it.Terrible story, directing, characters, dialogue. I'm SURE real Marines entering Afghan villages tell each other repeatedly to be respectful, don't want to offend the people who we are here to kill. There is NO way on earth that Nile was a real marine, she's tiny and as tough as an avocado sandwich, I've seen real Marines.This is the future of movies - inoffensive and everyone gets represented equally.Go watch Atomic Blonde again, you'll enjoy it more than this rubbish."
"262","The Old Guard",1,"1st edition of Don Quixote...","I watched until Charlize Theron's character nonchalantly pulled out a supposed first edition of one of the most famous and hard to acquire books on the planet from her backpack, hands it to a guy who immediately recognizes it but doesn't seem impressed, and quickly dismisses it by switching to a one hand carry (like it's not that big of a deal) in order to talk about whatever initial plot driver the writers want us to follow. Given his reaction, it would have been more plausible if Charlize's character was a food delivery person and she just brought him a bag with some Taco Bell. I'm sure there's not a Taco Bell anywhere nearby, given the architecture and it would have been quite an expensive delivery.Thanks to this poorly written/acted intro I'll wait until I'm more desperate for entertainment to give this another chance.I would also recommend not watching The Ninth Gate before starting this movie.Also, I usually like movies with Charlize Theron so I hope someone whose opinion I trust tells me that this movie is really good so I can give it another chance."
"263","The Old Guard",4,"Waited all summer for this craptastic movie!!!","The premise and set-up for this movie is good but it would be better as a TV show. I love Theron but she couldn't save this movie. They could have done so much more with this type of storyline and set-up but the movie is full of dull characters and the most cartoon villain ever from Big Pharma. This villain was so idiotic in every way and I wished someone would smack him every time he was on screen. Very predictable boring mess. The action wasn't even all that great compared to the other overrated Extraction movie with Thor. That movie still has the best action scenes for Netflix. Also, Theron's character is basically the same one she played in Hancock, which is a better ""comic book"" movie than this."
"264","The Old Guard",1,"Waste of time","I will never understand why Charlize Theron agreed to act in this film. It is one of the worst films I've seen in decades. It is all about shooting, fighting and killing, dressed in a flimsy storyline about immortality. The makers couldn't even be bothered to give that story any sense. Don't waste your time like I did."
"265","The Old Guard",1,"I resisted","I dislike Netflix for the way it functions. I get 99.99% of productions I really don't give a crap about and they keep sending me suggestions that when I watch them I realize they don't know my viewing desires.This is one of those productions.The Old Guard was summed up in the one paragraph on the description. It is boring, lame and a reboot of some old ideas. Where are the new ideas? Why can't writers think outside the box?The fight scenes were a bunch of cuts and quick camera pans. There was zero real choreographed scenes. The acting and direction were hand in hand horrible. The story, the script, the theme was extremely tiresome theme.It is pointless to attempt a deeper review. I have better things to do with my valuable time."
"266","The Old Guard",1,"Horrible Movie","Save your time and money.... this movie is absolute rubbish"
"267","The Old Guard",9,"Stunts and more awesome action","Charlize. Thanx for the fantasy and as always she is stunning in her Stunts and action scenes. Read an article that Charlize was to old to get parts, but come on! The woman is badass .NB and the movie is to;)"
"268","The Old Guard",1,"Boring","I was excited for it when I watched the trailer. But the movie was so boring. Poor storyline. I tried hard to like it... Not worth your time!"
"269","The Old Guard",4,"I am being generous with 4 stars.","There is really nothing about this movie that can be considered good. The acting is terrible from everyone. The directing is absolute trash. The script is so bad I can't imagine why anyone would accept to be in this movie. But the absolute worst part of this movie is the soundtrack. It's so noticeably bad that even if everything else would be fine this soundtrack would ruin the movie for you.I'm reading all these reviews with 7-10 stars and I just can't believe that these are not people from Netflix or someone in some way connected to the movie. You have to be really delusional to think that this is a good movie."
"270","The Old Guard",1,"Dont lose your time","This movie is the wort movie ever! It is a very bad mixing of Highlander and Sense8. Theres many script problems, bad actings and scenes with no sence for the movie enviroment."
"271","The Old Guard",3,"Poor","One more low budget movie with bad storyline not worth watching. Movie lovers don't waste your time on this"
"272","The Old Guard",5,"So F boring","35 mins in and I gave up watching this boring movie. Felt too slow and forced that I couldn't bring myself to watch more. Meh."
"273","The Old Guard",4,"High-Blander: The Blanding","This feels like a bland TV series reboot of The Highlander franchise. Its a low key, low budget movie that seems to un-ironically think it can compete with the big guns in the superhero game. A little humour may have helped lighten things up a little.If the movie had a more dynamic visual identity, or more creative camera work it may have added some interest, but for the most part the movie feels like a low budget Nic Cage actioner. So it is surprising to see A-lister Charlize Theron not only as star but also producer. Seems even her presence could not muster enough of a budget to up the production value or entice a more accomplished director to sign on.Theron herself gives a strangely inert performance. Her features are set into a single marble like expression through much of the film. The audience hardly ever get any significant insight into her character. It's mostly through other characters talking about her (while the beautifully broods just offscreen) that we find out some bits and pieces about what makes her tick. This second hand character development is not involving enough to keep the audience involved.There are a few narrative beats that keep this films heart, if not beating exactly, then at least give the occasional spasm of life. But only just, as these points of interest are few and far between. The stronger story beats are between two supporting characters and most of the more interesting narrative points are bundled in toward the end of act two. Way to late to be of interest. Sadly there's not all that much to make things really intriguing and except for the fight scenes there is very little entertainment value to be had. Though even the action scenes are all pretty much old hat for anyone who has seen a couple of John Wicks, or even Underworld movies.Maybe this is where the Highlander franchise would have gone if they kept making uninspired sequels."
"274","The Old Guard",1,"This is exactly how not to make a movie!","If Netflix thinks it is going with the trend, then it is. But Netflix just doesn't learn. The movie can be better by not trying to adopt too many daily things at once. I tried my best to finish the movie but the longer I watch, the worse I feel for those actors and actresses. The movie is simply edited terribly. Personally, I feel mentally offended by how Netflix attempts to get more subscribers."
"275","The Old Guard",1,"The Woke Guard","Seriously now what did you expect, if not another ridiculous Wokeflix production"
"276","The Old Guard",1,"Great idea, poor execution","The fight scenes are poor with constant cuts making it nauseating to watch."
"277","The Old Guard",1,"if it has a netflix logo it is a dissapointment","Well what can you ask from netflix, nothing good in years, you know they are too political influenced and try to hit too many audiences, there is a saying if you run after too many bunnies at one you catch none, looking over the ratings you can see that they did exactly that, targeted everybody got the scraps"
"278","The Old Guard",2,"Naive and oversimplified","Not suitable if you are over 15, or under 15.
Lacking depth, full of cliches. I was disappointed."
"279","The Old Guard",7,"Entertaining Netflix action movie","Entertaining Netflix action movie. The action scenes are good but this movie also had some deeper moments that explored the topic of mortality which made the movie stand out from your typical action movie. Just a fun watch if you got Netflix."
"280","The Old Guard",7,"You want an action movie, you got an action movie (but nothing more)","Cool concept, great actors, a few laughs and fun action scenes. But thats it. No real moral dilemmas, every conflict feels overly scripted. Not a time waster, might watch it again sometimes but also nothing to actually stay with me like a good movie should."
"281","The Old Guard",10,"Felt like I was at the movies again!","For me this movie was action packed keeping me on the edge of my seat from the beginning to the end . The acting and fighting scenes were amazing! This is the first movie I've seen in awhile that got me excited to see more .. this felt like a first rate movie you would expect to see in the movie theaters .. thank you Netflix for bringing us this amazing movie we get to watch at home !!!! :) don't know why there so so many haters out there .. the movie was free and was very well done ... I'm highly recommending this movie. I see a sequel here!"
"282","The Old Guard",2,"An amalgam of cliches","If you're a cinephile, you'll see that every single plot aspect of this movie has been done and overdone hundreds of times in the recent past. The dialogue is incredibly unimpressive for the cast of actors as well as the for their character roles within the film. The predictable very linear plot continued to unimpress as it trudged towards more unoriginal developments. If you enjoy cheap action movies that attempt to have depth but end up shallow, go for it. If you're looking for something fresh and unique, avoid it. It's wasted potential as usual."
"283","The Old Guard",3,"TIME WASTED!","Dont waste your time on this movie , its soo cringy u don't understand what's happening most of the time bad acting horrible fight scenes and a very predictable plot ...."
"284","The Old Guard",1,"Bad movie","This movie is garbage ,is boring and doesn't have something to watch to."
"285","The Old Guard",1,"Pointless & mediocre acting","I watched about three quarters of this movie waiting for any kind of plot or climax.....neither ever evolved. Poor acting ....especially the young black actress.... I kept wanting to shout ""CUT"" from my bed. Even Charlize suffered in this one ....she just doesn't fit the a$$ kicking character her last several movies have portrayed. I just watched Devil's Advocate last night and she smashed her role in that....just can't stomach her in Nikita form."
"286","The Old Guard",1,"Typically Netflix","This is another example that Netflix has become not much more than an indoctrination factory. Beware of the subliminal messages. At the credits, for example, 6(!) references to the crusades, of which in reality there were 38, and no reference what so ever to jihad, of which there were over 500 aimed at europe alone. Are we feeling a little guilty somehow already, but we don't really know why?
Nowadays, nothing is what it seems anymore. Be suspicious of everything Netflix comes out with.
Other than that, reasonable action scenes, with many plot holes and cringe moments."
"287","The Old Guard",1,"Yet another violent empty film","No seriously uttered short sentences can justify all this rubbish."
"288","The Old Guard",1,"The dumbest movie I've seen in my life.","I desperately try to enjoy everything I watch, and appreciate the creative team's choices. After all, I watch movies to be entertained!Never before have I been so lost for positivity.I am so angry at having wasted my life watching this steaming pile of garbage. You can almost see the actors themselves cringing though some of the stupider dialogue.If they hired a military consultant, they did not get their money's worth, and the entire writing room should be taken behind a shed and shot. The only redeeming aspect of the entire experience is that I didn't waste any money on a ticket, and it came out on Netflix.Charlize Theron was amazing as always, but this is a cringefest written for 12-year-old girls."
"289","The Old Guard",1,"Do not bother","Very weak acting, boring plot... The visuals are okay, but the rest is is just terrible. Nothing to see here, really."
"290","The Old Guard",1,"Movie made by amateurs","This was nothing but a waste of time, really boring, and not worth watching."
"291","The Old Guard",2,"Amerika - Violence - Woke - The End","That's it.Yes, i skipped the violence - ""watched"" the flick in ~ 20 Minutes. What a pointless waste of time."
"292","The Old Guard",3,"Painful","Boring. Familiar PC flags planted. Zero character empathy built. Childish; absolutely childish & condescending on so many levels. The irony about calling movies like this ""woke"" is that they so often put many to sleep.Who's this for?If you want a new release with tension, a good story & a popcorn shovelling night in, watch Greyhound."
"293","The Old Guard",4,"Good story bad dailogs & songs that dont fit in","This is simply my opinion about this movie
The overall movie is average. charlize did a good job
Some cheesy dialogs and sentiments.the fight scenes are good to watch and ruined by songs in the background. watchable if nothing else to watch"
"294","The Old Guard",9,"Great film. Unexpected fun, believability and universe establishing. Hoping for a sequel","Great cast, clean plot. Silly fun, but not silly silly. Action was believable and great camaraderie."
"295","The Old Guard",1,"Unlikeable characters whisper-panicking","Every characters is exactly the same... panicky, whispering, insecure. Everyone acts tough, doesn't breathe. Unlikeable/unfollowable characters."
"296","The Old Guard",5,"The Woke Guard","Well they nailed the diversity in this flick. Most of the action is on point & Charlise Theron is great as always. But that's about it, the script & dialog is super boring, no funny or interesting moments just bad cheesy ones, basically every character is boring. Unfortunately they waste a bunch of time recruiting the new comer & getting her to terms with what's going on. She keeps whinging the whole way through, I feel like every film that's similar does the same thing & it's just repetitive. The music is mostly out of place. The villain/s are not the best & it feels about 20minutes too long. Overall it's just another forgettable Monday night flick. A generous 5/10."
"297","The Old Guard",2,"Even Charlize can't keep me watching this!","But Charlize Theron is a goddess. So 2 stars just for Charlize. I watched it in 3 days <U+0001F605>"
"298","The Old Guard",1,"Spectacularly awful, unoriginal and dull...","Spectacularly awful, unoriginal and dull with some diabolical acting and the threat that the Highlander franchise was surreptitiously making its way back by reincarnating itself with Underworld but without leather."
"299","The Old Guard",1,"Terrible","Possibly the worst film I've ever seen. Period. Shockingly terrible. I can not gain back the 2:05 hours I lost watching this dribble."
"300","The Old Guard",1,"Rubber tiles kindergarten crybaby movie with superheroes ?","These kinds of commercial baloney films are increasingly being reviewed !
Why does every movie have to be so terribly politically correct nowadays. Does humor with self-mockery still exist ? The patronizing nature/condescending character of this film to the viewers worries me. Also: humans are fragile and not immortal and anything but superheroes. I yearn for more content and realism. Who censors and screwes up these films with emotional waterfalls of dialogues ? Please, give good movie actors, like Charlize Theron good movies !"
"301","The Kissing Booth",NA,"Fun Film","Realistic and uncensored (i.e. non-conformist) teen movies are rare, but this is one. It is something different and as an adult I enjoyed it.Don't judge by 1930s standards. Be open to advancement and a truthful movie made to be fun to watch"
"302","The Kissing Booth",NA,"Good Family Film","It was cutesy and fun. I know girls like to fantasize and probably watch it as girls-only, but if you have a good relationship in the family it is fun to watch as a family to see what girls dream of and also to have some fun."
"303","The Kissing Booth",8,"This Was Fun To Watch","And I am a grown woman. I do have to admit that I watch teen movies because they are fun. This one was fun and sure the man-boy was a hunk."
"304","The Kissing Booth",NA,"This was fun","It is a pure teen movie but even if I am not a teen I had fun watching it. It is in the same league as Mean Girls."
"305","The Kissing Booth",7,"Clcihe...",".... but I could not stop watching. I admit.I mean here comes another girl who of course falls for the muscular hunk. What is with women loving only beefcakes?Oh well, at least he is genuinely interested in her and really cares and checking out her wiles we know why.
A film to watch as a family one evening and forget about."
"306","The Kissing Booth",NA,"Finally a film that is not all that serious and is fun","Girl can be a teenage girl and boy can be a teenage boy and like the old teen movies they can have feelings, be imperfect and experiment with love, emotions, sexuality and mostly freedom. It is fun to watch. There is nos ex scene, but isn't sex and sexuality nature?"
"307","The Kissing Booth",8,"Why do girls always go for beef cakes?","This movie is extremely cliched, but that is what I would expect from a movie of this nature so I enjoyed it anyway. What I didn't expect was for me to have such a strong hope that young girls and men watch this and learn. The one reason I gave this movie 8 stars is not because acting is pretty good but because it signals that clarity and communication in relationships is important."
"308","The Kissing Booth",NA,"An OK family film with a good message","The girl is doing her best and performing as well as possible under duress and pressure. Dating is competitive but she is doing her best with all she has. she isn't the sexiest babe, but flaunts just a little to attract a man."
"309","The Kissing Booth",6,"The fantasy of a fifteen year old girl","If you want to experience a fifteen year old girls fantasy, this is it!! :)
For that it like it, kind of. 
The acting is even pretty good, given that the writing is clumsy."
"310","The Kissing Booth",9,"Good family film and positive message","This wasfun to watch. The setting is fun and oriented on two teens with the girl getting a lot of attention from her hunk. Many inferior suitors come for the girl but she is rarely dazzled by weak men. A positive message."
"311","The Kissing Booth",8,"Portrays a good message!","Full of lovely scenes and lines and the messages that this movie portrays are uplifting for young girls. A guy ignores you but it's okay because he is popular and then you get to go on a date with him and you win him because that's what you want, the main guy is strong, powerful and an alpha male and borderline sexy... the only slightly disappointing factor was the relationship between the best friends."
"312","The Kissing Booth",NA,"Great Film - Best Rom Com Out There","Really enjoyed it. Smart girl who has determination. The man is a real Alpha male, modern relationship with a thin hot bod who is worth it, laughs and of course lots of laugh to make it qualify as a comedy. Enjoy"
"313","The Kissing Booth",8,"This was fun","It is a pure teen movie but even if I am not a teen I had fun watching it. It is in the same league as Mean Girls."
"314","The Kissing Booth",7,"Good Message For Young Girls","SPOILER: Yes, at first glance the movie is just cute and light only. Elle and Noah are a classic girl and best friend's older brother couple, not unusual and not too sappy. But here's the real triumph: Noah is an alpha male and has a lot of love in him - before they're even official. He adores her and expects her to be protected by him. We already know he cares when he tells her not to go to parties, takes ownership and gets into fights over her. So romantic! There is one scene in particular where he fights someone over Elle's honor and then he is visibly upset. This is a good relationship for young girls and good to feel wanted and loved. How many men care enough like he does? We should carefully consider how our current media affects young minds in the formative stages where every film has too-cool-to-be-in-love-kids. Not here. I want more kisses!! number two please."
"315","The Kissing Booth",7,"Great Role Models For Teenage Girls","This is not a old people's movie. The adventure is quite innocent. What this is a coming of age movie that has both nostalgia and strong gender roles. One can be beautiful and strong at the same time. One can be a girl at school and in love at the same time. One should not be ashamed of the human body and so on. Good film."
"316","The Kissing Booth",8,"Showing The feelings of 14-15 year old girls","It is a great type of message to girls that she should be true to her feelings and also be happy with her body and proud of herself, her body and her own thoughts. Good film to watch with parents so they can deal with reality."
"317","The Kissing Booth",8,"OK movie with right message","I can't say that i did not enjoy this film. It was fineand it is difficult not to fall for Joey Kings manliness. Yet the movie sent some strange signals because he is fighting for a butterface. Yes, she is thin and has feminine hair. It shows the second a girl shows skin she gets attention and the boy she wants, which is all true, natural and good. Also it is obviously one of the oldest cliches in life about a girl falling for the hunk."
"318","The Kissing Booth",7,"kiss them both","It is a surprisingly complex teen love story , so much so that I couldn't believe that it ended , when it did . maybe a nice divergence from the simple streak of rom-coms . story is fresh-ish , acting nice , well the movie ain't bad"
"319","The Kissing Booth",8,"Unleashing The Sexual prowess Of Teenage Girls","Think nature, normalcy, Britney Spears video...What type of message does it send to girls when she has to strip several times to gain Noah's attention? One of power and control of course. The female body is powerful and the message is treat your body well and become attractive and you control men.A feminist message."
"320","The Kissing Booth",9,"more history of noah and elle please!! I love it!!!","The sequel please!!! a funny movie ... the actors gave everything on the set !!! We all want more about noah and elle ... we need a second one please!"
"321","The Kissing Booth",8,"Shows A Little Bit Of Skin","But really not enough to be free and coolThis is clearly a good attempt to make a sequel for John Hughes films. They had the right ingredients. Bunch of so-so girls (need to be more naturl and flaunt) and guys, losers fighting back the status quo, a main character who starts from 2, goes to 9, loses everything to go way back to 0 and then goes back to... 9 'cause she shouldn't have it all, it would be too cliché right?"
"322","The Kissing Booth",1,"Literally the worst","The only reason I'm giving 1 is because I cant give it a zero or below. Straight up awful. So bad."
"323","The Kissing Booth",10,"Super cute movie!","In all honesty I don't get why people are rating it 1/10 or 2/10. I loved it. Super cute story line about a thin line between friendship or falling in love with her bff's brother. Definitely recommend!"
"324","The Kissing Booth",10,"completely surprised!","I saw reviews that said the film was poor,
however personally I thoroughly enjoyed the film and will be watching it again. it's comedic, emotional and sweet all at the same time. the actors have amazing chemistry and the plot is very well planned out and full of twists.
wouldn't recommend for 12 and under however.
amazing film!"
"325","The Kissing Booth",NA,"A really entertaining film","This is what might be termed a wry humour film. I can see why it is popular with all age groups - you might call it romantic comedy - it says a lot about crowd mentality. But it is about more than gender sociologically. Great acting from the chick... a real heteroFrom the spelling of humour you can guess I am not American.So I am not ashamed of the human body."
"326","The Kissing Booth",8,"Giving me the feels","This movie was just a typical rom-com, but such a good one! It's giving me all kinds of feelings. I'll probably watch it again in a couple of days. Cinematography is great and haven't really noticed bad acting in anyway! Just a fun movie to watch with friends, alone or with your so!"
"327","The Kissing Booth",9,"A loveable, awkward, romantic-comedy","I have read many reviews saying it was cringy and unpredictable. But I loved it. The acting and chemistry was extremely believable. I loved Elle's extremely akward character and her relationship with Lee and Noah Flynn. Sure, at sometimes it was predictable and a bit cringy but I feel like that's part of what made the film so lovable.
However I would have like to see her relationship with her family a bit more. I feel like that wasn't covered as well as other areas of the film because we had about 2 scenes with her dad, who's character I didn't really understand. But apart from that the film was an amazing awkward, romantic-comedy. Although, it did have a wonderful message at the end about individuality which I loved."
"328","The Kissing Booth",10,"Super Cute Movie","I'm older, but I loved this movie! It's a super cute feel good movie. Granted it might not be the best message for young people, but people, it's fiction. And it's fun. And I loved the soundtrack. Great job on this movie and I will get the book to read as well."
"329","The Kissing Booth",10,"Must see Rom Com of the year!","I absolutely loved this movie! Such a cute and fun movie that it is hard not to like. Didn't hurt that one of the main characters IS ""stupid hot"", but that is not the only reason this movie works. It is funny, sweet, engaging and just a fun movie- the music is great as well. The chemistry between Elle and Noah is off the charts and it no surprise that the actors are dating in real life. Definitely worth all the hype and I highly recommend."
"330","The Kissing Booth",7,"A good family film","The girls are not the thinnest but they are not Disney taliban style ashamed of their gender or bodies either.It delivers a good message to teenage girls (be proud of your bodies, fight for what you want, take care of your man..) and the same for teenage men (take care of your girl, protect her, take care of your body, etc.)."
"331","The Kissing Booth",NA,"Not another teen movie..","It is not from the ISIS groupies of Disney so it is a good teen movie. I love the characters and the set up because they are strong and do not deny their own feelings and physiology. 9/10"
"332","The Kissing Booth",10,"CAN'T STOP WATCHING!!","As everyone else, I read about the movie coming out, but I didn't watch it. The first time I watched it I couldn't stop laughing, crying and feeling again the emotion of being in loved again, and specially with your first crush. I have seen the movies 5 times and I can't stop watching it. Every time is something new that I missed the first time. It's super funny. I like how they connect details with the movie The Breakfast Club and not only because Molly Ringwald is the mother of Noah and Lee. I loved the music, the scenery ... in conclusion EVERYTHING. I want a part 2."
"333","The Kissing Booth",10,"Favourite movie!","Fav movie at the moment! The plot was funny and the actors really took their role! Love it, looking for the sequel!"
"334","The Kissing Booth",10,"I NEED A SECOND ONE","Such a cute story and even though the guy isn't perfect and he tries to control her she doesn't let him. they help each other with their imperfections and the issues that come with their relationship. watching this movie honestly made me so happy and I would do anything to see a part two."
"335","The Kissing Booth",7,"Wasn't what I expected but I enjoyed it","People say the acting is bad, that it has a bad representation of women, I disagree - to me it's a story about love, of course, but also knowing what you want, having to make an unideal decision, sure it's kinda cliched to start off with, but an enjoyable film none the less"
"336","The Kissing Booth",10,"Loved It!","I know a lot of people hated the message but I didn't mind it at all. I'm all for it. It could have been much worst. World let's not have blinders on....things like this happen...people have anger issues....you fall for the wrong people...you make childish stupid mistakes. But to read comments about the lead female character attractiveness is the problem with the world today. I really enjoyed it and will watch it again. Although the message isn't great for the younger crowd....parents should be responsible for what they allow their kids to watch. But for a older person who enjoys cheese romance movies they will love this and I did."
"337","The Kissing Booth",7,"Hard to Rate","The acting was good, for the type of movie it was. The chemistry was great. I liked all of the main characters, but the writers WTF? They blamed the love interest for what the main female character was responsible for? WTF? Did I miss why everyone hated the love interest as well? I mean, sure, maybe they didn't think he was right for her, I get that, but they all seemed to actively DISLIKE him. EVERYONE in the mc's life hated him. I didn't get that at all. I actually came to write I think my third? review on this site after 10 years because I'm so confused.Is this explained in the book or something? Did he do something other than kiss/sleep with a lot of girls?"
"338","The Kissing Booth",10,"Amazing movie with great chemistry","I absolutely loved this movie 
And for those who say its full of clichées well thats completely normal when it was first written it was a teen's rom-com maybe thats what Beth Reeckles (the author) wanted to write about or maybe thats what she liked writing about 
I say for everyone to chill out its a movie for people to enjoy"
"339","The Kissing Booth",10,"Ah-mazing!","10/10 for the story line and cast. Loved it!
Different story so far yet inspiring and romantic."
"340","The Kissing Booth",1,"Bad message for young girls","SPOILER: Sure, at first glance the movie is cute and light. Elle and Noah are a classic girl and best friend's older brother deal, not unusual but not too sappy. But here's the real problem: Noah is extremely controlling and manipulative of Elle- before they're even dating. He orders her around and expects her to do as he says, tells her not to go to parties, threatens boys who want to date her, and gets into fights over her. There is one scene in particular where he fights someone over something they have said to Elle, and then he screams at Elle to get into his car. Is this a good relationship for young girls to be idolizing? Do we want them to think that's okay for boys to control them? Maybe we should carefully consider how our current media affects young minds in the formative stages."
"341","The Kissing Booth",2,"Absolutely Ridiculous","Okay, so the movie is cheesy, the dialogue is cheesy, the entire plot is incredibly cliche. The entire football team going ""OOH"" when she sassed Noah, I mean really?? I could get past all that if the relationship between the two main characters was believable. I know that they're dating in real life and it really shocks me because me and my friends that watched this all thought there was barely any chemistry. I feel like they should've actually developed the relationship more instead of showing cheesy montages. It felt like they dated for five seconds before they were in love. Also, I'd just like to say that the notion that Noah could get into Harvard is downwright absured and just plain laughable. Harvard is extremely selective and don't just look at your grades, they look at everything. In the movie he is constantly getting into fights and he skips school. There is no freaking way he could have ever gotten into Harvard. I just couldn't get past how ridiculous that was, I know it was in the book, but it's just plain stupid. This movie could've been cute but the acting was ridiculous and the plot was entirely unbelievable."
"342","The Kissing Booth",2,"Dont know why i watched this","Its so cheesy and SO cringey that i kept face palming and rubbimg my oncoming headache away. Please dont watch this if your taste in movies is...mature??"
"343","The Kissing Booth",9,"Ignore the ratings!","Okay, I'm 21 years old and I went into this movie with the expectations of it being geared toward the 16 year old- 13 reasons why- watching crowd but I was VERY surprised. I truly loved how simple this movie was. The actors were filled with charisma, and although predictable, the plot was good enough that it kept me wanting to see more. All in all, It's totally a feel good and emotional, yet sweet classic high school love story that I would probably watch again and recommend to others!!"
"344","The Kissing Booth",8,"Total Nostalgia Trip","I really really enjoyed this movie, which was a pleasant surprise because I wasn't expecting to. It gave me all the feels of the 80s & 90s movies that definied coming of age and falling in love.Was it cheesy? Yes, for sure! Is it real life? No way! But aren't all Teen Rom Coms supposed to be a bit of an escape? That's part of what makes them great!"
"345","The Kissing Booth",10,"We need a kissing booth sequel!","I absolutely adored this movie. Rarely i watch a movie more than once but ive watched this several times already! Its aimed at teenage girls yes but im a woman in my 30's and i just loved it! Its hilarious with some great one liners! A great little love story and good actors which were perfectly cast imo. Loved the soundtrack too!
The movie reminded me a bit of 10 things i hate about you and had a definite 80's / 90's vibe to it, we just dont get many movies like this anymore and its such a shame. 
In regards to promoting abusive relationships, pffft!! Noah is a teenager and Elle has been like a little sister to him all his life. He is over protective and doesnt want to see her date any of the guys interested in her because he knows they are players and he knows they wont treat her right. I think the story is beautiful and the friendship between Elle and Lee is amazing and so entertaining
Jacob Elordi (Noah) was great in his breakout role and very nice to look at and an Aussie! Joey King (Elle) was so entertaining and carried the movie well. I loved Joel Courtney (Lee) He cracked me up, such a great cast that had so much chemistry between them all. 
The fact that Elordi and King met eachother on set and fell for eachother and are now together IRL makes the movie even more special and has hands down become one of my favourite movies, a cult classic and a must see for its genre!"
"346","The Kissing Booth",2,"Littered with Cliches and Teenage Delusion","As I watched, I kept thinking that this movie had a very limited target audience. High school kids would likely relate to this, especially high school girls. Anyone older than that, would see the absurdity of everything going on and ask, ""WTF?"" 
 
 The Kissing Booth is the story of two high school best friends, Lee and Shelly (Joel Courtney and Joey King). They love to dance, according to the opening narration. This comes up later in the movie in a way that's supposed to be significant and touching, but it's actually lame and eyeroll-worthy.  The pals share an agreed upon list of friendship rules that come up sporadically throughout the story. Most of them are silly, the sort of rules you would expect from kids who are six, not 16. Rule number one is ""you tell each other your birthday wishes."" Really, that's rule number one? That's the first and most important rule of friendship? That's the level of ridiculousness this movie purports.  One day, Shelly and Lee need to create a fundraiser for a school club and decide to set up a kissing booth. All the girls want to kiss Lee's hunky older brother Noah (Jacob Elordi), all the girls including Shelly, who has developed a crush. As luck would have it, Noah also has feelings for Shelly, so he finagles his way into sharing a lip lock with her at the kissing booth. Their feelings for each other become clear, but, oh no, the friends have a rule against dating each other's family! Shelly and Noah must hook up in secret. Cue the predictable montages of the two lovebirds as they narrowly avoid getting caught by Lee and many others. It's hard to watch. Not only is it a painfully obvious and cliché storytelling tactic, it feels icky watching high school kids hook up over and over again. These aren't even the only moments that feel exploitative. Many scenes sexually exploit Shelly, as crowds of guys ogle her and cheer her on as she strips in the boys locker room and again later while drunk at a party. Like I said, icky. For some reason, there always seems to be a crowd cheering, oohing and awing at nearly every moment, which is clearly ridiculous. It's the sort of thing that only makes sense in a high school kid's fantasy. They're so self-conscious, even narcissistic, that they constantly feel that their every move is on display for the world. In this movie, that is depicted literally.Not so coincidentally, the movie is based on a book that was written by a girl at age 15. That explains so much. Now I understand why the movie suggests that kissing is the most important thing in the world. It implies that the kissing booth changed all their lives forever, which, again, is the sort of thing that only makes sense in a high school kid's fantasy. Of course, learning that the story was written by a 15-year-old, does not excuse all its flaws. The movie is still mostly awful, littered with plot holes and logical blunders. This movie could be perfect for a high school date night, but that's about it. It's not a good movie. I would advise anyone over the age of 18 to give this a hard pass."
"347","The Kissing Booth",10,"My fav Netflix movie","The love story you always wanted in high school. The characters are relatable and for once there is no girl drama. It's just a cute teenage love story with a really great ending for YAs"
"348","The Kissing Booth",10,"Adorable and awkward romantic comedy about teen love and friendship","The main three actors have amazing chemistry. Joey King is absolutely adorable as Elle in every way and so is her friendship with Lee (Joel Courtney). They have these cute little rules they are not supposed to break. Rule 9 is not to date Lee's bad boy brother Noah (Jacob Elordi). Their rules are pretty cute. Lee is out to protect Elle, especially from his bad boy brother. But, girls like bad boys.Elle, who has never been kissed, really wants bad boy Noah to kiss her so she sets up a Kissing Booth at school, and he kisses her. Sparks fly between them and soon they are secretly dating. This is not a spoiler since this is the plot of the whole film. Is the love of a friend stronger than the love of a lover? Which do you ultimately choose? What are you willing to risk for love?I figured the movie would be simple, but it is rather complex emotionally and paints a rather good picture of romance between Elle and Noah, and a great friendship between Elle and Lee. But, can her breaking Rule 9 destroy that friendship?It definitely made me a fan of Joey King. The movie is really all about her and her choices in life, and she delivers a strong performance (and she's totally adorable). You find yourself torn over her choice to date Noah and all that ensues. She's a rather complicated character and has a lot of depth. So does Lee. Noah's character surprises with quite a bit of depth, as well.The only unbelievable part? How Elle and Lee didn't become more than just best friends. Many times I was like, the heck with Noah, date Lee. The best guy for you is right in front of you.The ending really left open a sequel many say, but, it really is more like European films that leave what happens next up to the viewer.It's cute film."
"349","The Kissing Booth",10,"I loved it , such a cute film","The story is so beautiful and positive. It is really a very nice fantasy about teen relationships and I recommend."
"350","The Kissing Booth",10,"Surprisingly good for a Netflix movie","Netflix really nailed it this time. So fun and entertaining! I absolutely don't agree with the ones who gave this movie a low rating! Movies like this is supposed to be cliche and predictable. That's what's makes them good! This is a movie that is a little heartbreaking and awkward at some point but mostly fun! Really enjoyed it. Love the story and the characters. The script is a bit poor sometimes but it doesn't make it bad. It's totally one of my favorite movies of all time and I have watched A LOT of movies. Trust me.
Already watched it way to many times but I can't get enough. It is so hilarious and it makes me laugh every time. Really have something extra to it. Just watch it and ignore the reviews with low rating! And if you don't like it, just turn it off, easy as that!"
"351","The Kissing Booth",5,"It Could've Been Great","I've been seeing this movie around the internet for a while, and a lot of people said that it was great, so I gave it a try. I was expecting it to be a proper rom-com teenage movie, but instead it was a cringey movie which was romanticizing a possible problematic relationship. Noah, who was the love interest of the main character, was very controlling even before they were in a relationship. On the other hand, the main character was just as bossy. There were a lot of cringe-worthy moments in this movie, especially with a lot of lines and with the party scene. The actors were great, though it felt weird that the leading man looked like a 20+ old guy trying to get a 15 year-old girl through cheesy and cliche lines. All in all, this movie had potential, but not enough to become a sensational rom-com movie."
"352","The Kissing Booth",10,"This movie was fantastic and now is one of my favorites","I haven't been able to find any new teenage high school movies that were good or interesting till I found The Kissing Booth. Whenever I thought I would find a great movie like this one I kept getting let down and started losing hope for a bit. I almost didn't even watch this movie, but already 10 minutes into the film, I knew it would be great. It has a great combination of your favorite movies from the 80s and 90s and a modern day love story. The casting is great and the chemistry between the characters is great and very understandable as the main love interest is dating in real life. At times, some scenes were slightly cheesy, but overall the film was solid. I even felt that the cheesy scenes fit well with the movie and balanced out nicely. I believe this film was truly amazing and is one of the best, if not the best, coming of age/teenage films I have seen. I think that the people rating this film poorly have never liked this genre of film because they would love it if they did. I greatly enjoyed watching this film and highly recommend that you watch whenever possible because it will not let you down when you do."
"353","The Kissing Booth",7,"I hope they make a second one","Nd this time it focuses on many girls and many guys. So like the kissing booth shows many girls and many beaus with all sorts of guys kissing them. Also if you want a prettier girl call me lol I love to be in the kissing booth and have fun"
"354","The Kissing Booth",2,"eh","Cringiest and most predictable movie I have ever watched."
"355","The Kissing Booth",1,"Awful- not in a good way","Awful and borderline offensive screenplay, performances give the writing a good run for its money in terms of mediocrity."
"356","The Kissing Booth",1,"I feel genuinely concerned for the wellbeing of anyone who actually thinks that this is a good movie.","That is all. I have nothing else to say. I'm literally only still writing because IMDB claims that my review is too short."
"357","The Kissing Booth",1,"Teenagers, adults, everyone deserves better than this.","The Kissing Booth is an agognizing movie. Now look, I get it. Teenagers need movies to relate to, and this is the movies target audience. I had this problem with 13 Reasons Why and To All The Boys I've Loved Before. All of these sources of media all have the same message: it's okay to be a weak, shallow, ignorant and low person. The Kissing Booth does this in a way that's not only insulting to the target audience, but also to the entire audience that spent 90 minutes watching this garbage. The movie all throughout has the main character narrating it. I know it's based on a book, but Jesus it's just unnecessary and falls flat in regard to comedy and trying to relate. Also, the main character is a selfish moron. I know teenagers make dumb decisions but she doesn't ever seem to learn anything throughout her experiences. That's the polar opposite of good story telling. A character is given a character ark and has to overcome it to become a compelling character. That doesn't happen with Joey King's character. She is a complete idiot and does not learn anything that benefits her well-being. She constantly talks about these rules in her friendship with her friend and she breaks nearly half of them. This could be a potential ark for her and her friend. But by the end, BOTH of them break the rules. So you don't feel satisfied with the ending at all. This is the black hole of bad teenage movies and I'm gonna give The Kissing Booth a 1/10. This is most certainly the worst Netflix Original I've seen in a while. And Adam Sandler has made four of them within the past three years."
"358","The Kissing Booth",1,"I couldn't help but cringe the all movie","This movie should be titled: ""Worst clichés compilation"". I honestly feel like a 14 year old girl directed this movie... I mean it's 2018, high school movies are gone long ago, but if you want to do one at least put something meaningful or significantly different in it..."
"359","The Kissing Booth",1,"Terrible","Massive cheese fest. Terrible message for females. Subpar acting. Excessively predictable and full of cliches."
"360","The Kissing Booth",2,"It tries to be so good","This movie tried to copy every successful teeny hopper movie. It even had Molly Ringwald for a few minutes. And she didn't help. 
It is one of the worst movies Netflix has put out."
"361","The Kissing Booth",1,"Avoid like the plague","While watching The Kissing Booth, I was only met with immense confusion. Confused on why I was still watching a terribly acted, poorly written, with annoying/unlikable characters and an out-of-touch coming of age story and confused on whether this movie was a parody of itself due to how laughable it was. The movie lacks a clear understanding of its target audience of the average teenage girl, whereas I am confused whether the target audience is actually for extremely rich teenage girls who just so happen to act like a terrible actress all at the same time. Possibly? Who knows. Please avoid unless you want to waste your time on a very, very, very lazy movie."
"362","The Kissing Booth",5,"Cheesy but in a good way","I watched this film because I wanted a cheesy, feel good romcom and that is exactly what I got. No it's not an Academy Award winner but I never expected it to be. I would have gave it a higher rating if it were not for Noah's controlling and intimidating behaviour being shown in a positive manner. It's not acceptable or desirable for a partner to behave in such a way so please do not glamourise it."
"363","The Kissing Booth",1,"I am ashamed that it was filmed at my University","I created an account to give this movie a bad review, it is awful. It glorifies abusive relationships, is sexist, patriarchal, misogynistic, features gay-sploitation, and was clearly made from and for the male gaze. I am disgusted that my university allowed such problematic content to be filmed at UCT. We had hopes for Lee, bu even he described Elle as an object. Full of cliches, bad tropes, terrible, acting, awful and cliche script, average cinematography and editing. Please for the love of god do not watch this movie"
"364","The Kissing Booth",1,"It's What I Expected","I kind of knew what I was walking in to with this one but I kept an open mind.The biggest issue with this film is the writing. It is a mess. The characters just don't talk like real people. The things they say are so stupid but not even in a humorous way just in a way that confuses you. Like words like Lady Bump being used in a serious context. It is so strange.The acting is hit or miss at best.I don't know if they did or not but to me it felt like Nickelodeon studios produced this film, it has that fort of vibe to it like in the vain of like Fun-Size or Fred the movie or something.It just dragged on so much too I thought I'd been watching it nearly an hour but unfortunately I'd only watched 21 minutes.When I was thinking of the rating I thought it was a 1 star but then I thought that was kinda harsh so I tried to think of redeeming qualities and guess what, I couldn't think of one.So I would say skip it, I'm am going to watch the sequel when it come out just out of morbid curiosity but I don't hold out much hope."
"365","The Kissing Booth",2,"i just can't wait for the movie to end while watching it","Ok, first of all the casting was very bad, even i can act better than those people. and the main character is soooooo unlikeable. i tried really hard to like her and such but i just can't. she's just plain annoying! and the plot? it was mediocre. but BAD mediocre. don't waste your time guys."
"366","The Kissing Booth",1,"it's the end of civilization","You know the entertainment industry has hit a new low when they're basing movies off Wattpad books (for those who don't know, it's an online writing site infamous even among its own users)."
"367","The Kissing Booth",1,"Glorifies abusive relationships","As this was featured on Netflix I gave it a go. I was fine with it until the main character's love interest threatened other guys at her school (potentially for years) to keep them from expressing interest in her. Even after that I still kept on with it for a bit. Unfortunately, as mfbeif said, the scene where they argue was deeply problematic for me. He punches another guy in the stomach, then as she runs off, chases her into a dark parking lot and yells at her and hits the car until she gets scared and goes in. It gave me flashbacks of being in an abusive relationship and I immediately stopped watching. I understand this movie being made, my opinion isn't everything, but really disappointed in Netflix and in it being considered to be featured on the main page."
"368","The Kissing Booth",2,"Portrays a bad message!","Full of cliched scenes and lines and the messages that this movie portrays are horrible for young girls. A guy slaps your ass but it's okay because he is popular and then you get to go on a date with him, the main guy is manipulative, controlling and aggressive and borderline abusive... the only slightly redeemable factor was the relationship between the best friends."
"369","The Kissing Booth",8,"Cute movie!","A cute movie! It was refreshing to see a movie where the popular girls aren't drop dead gorgeous, they are normal looking - it's definitely more realistic. I also think it's good for kids to see average looking women instead of the stunning super model types the 90's movies had."
"370","The Kissing Booth",10,"It's no masterpiece but for a casual chick flick..","I actually found this movie quite refreshing. I understand people's points about feminism and possessiveness etc but I think it just a representation of high school life and they depicted it quite well. If you're into girly chick flicks, then give it a watch. And for those saying the actors had zero chemistry, check their instagrams lol"
"371","The Kissing Booth",10,"Love this movie!","Loved everything about this movie! Acting was great! The chemistry was awesome, had me laughing and even made me cry. Just an awesome movie!"
"372","The Kissing Booth",9,"Feel good movie with great acting","This movie surprised me so much! I expected a cheesy and badly casted chick flick , but the opposite was proven! The story line is surprisingly unusual, fresh and I really appreciated the cast. Not the best movie ever seen, but definitely highly rank-able for its genre."
"373","The Kissing Booth",10,"SO GOOD","Okay, to be honest, i love this movie. very much. i don't care if people said its a bad movie, i still love it. 10 out of 10 for me."
"374","The Kissing Booth",4,"Extremely predictable and unrealistic","First off, this movie is derived from a Wattpad story, so that pretty much tells you the depth it has. The portrayal of high school is very unrealistic and almost feels like a campy satire of traditional high school cliches from the early 2000s. Not only that, but the characters are far from complex - they have little to no personality or development, and it seems as if the message of the entire movie is based on outer appearance alone. The predictability of the film is also a factor, as you can literally guess the ending of the movie and how the whole plot pans out just from the trailer that Netflix plays before you click on the title. That's how vapid it is. However, I really enjoyed Joey King's performance, and I hope to see her in better works in the future. The Kissing Booth is fun to watch when there's nothing else to pick from, but that's about it."
"375","The Kissing Booth",10,"Sensational!","This movie is so amazing, emotional, vulnerable yet light-hearted and funny. I've rewatched it so many times I've lost count. Love it and would recommend over and over again"
"376","The Kissing Booth",3,"Not so innocent","This movie could have been cute and romantic but instead portrays sex and drinking (not to mention sneaking around) in high school as being innocent. I know that's is sometimes what happens in high school but as a parent, I'm disappointed and confused why this would be a Message in a movie that I can only imagine is meant for teenagers."
"377","The Kissing Booth",3,"All Round Cringey","I started watching with fairly low expectations. I was mostly nostalgic of my own teenage years (10-15 years ago; I am currently 28) when loads of similar high school romance/drama movies were being churned out. ""The Kissing Booth"" isn't missing any of the painfully worn out clichés: the high-school jock, the clique of mean arrogant bitches, the underdog of a main character, the high school prom as a climax moment, etc. However, this movie proved to set a new low. I could tell right away that the cast is mostly extremely mediocre (in some parts strikingly ill-fitting), and this didn't help to sell the very poor screenplay and practically non-existent story, which really felt like such an ineptly put together collection of predictable cheesiness, that I couldn't help but think of a certain high school drama novel I had once read, which was written by a 15-year-old girl. And what do you know! The book this movie is based on was written by a 15-year-old girl (she is 21 by now but was 15 when she wrote it). I couldn't believe the chances but at the same time wasn't surprised. It is very obvious to me that the author lacked the experience and the skill to build a solid story and to tell it believably (yes, even a ridiculous high school flick). The screenwriter didn't exactly make a masterpiece of it either. Why anyone would pick this book to turn into a movie is beyond me.
I am giving it 3 stars because of some acceptable cinematographic moments and because I *did* go in looking for a bit of corniness. And well, I guess for overall effort too.
It may be that I'm too old and bitter to buy it, and that the moments I would have found dreamy at 15 are the ones that made me roll my eyes at 28. Either way, these are my 2 cents."
"378","The Kissing Booth",3,"I screamed at the wall while watching this movie","I am a sucker for romance, especially teenage romance. Usually I like this kind of movies. However, this one doesn't do it for me, the sub-par acting, (in my opinion) not so attractive female lead, the lack of chemistry, the predictable plot line and the cringey as hell dialogue just made this movie a pain to watch. I wouldn't recommend it no."
"379","The Kissing Booth",2,"Rollercoaster, but a bad one.","This movie was bad and weird. First of all that dude looked like 25 or something and the girl like 15 years old. Second; this movie was going like really fast on some point while other things took like a year to devolpe."
"380","The Kissing Booth",9,"Loved it","Really enjoyed this movie. Cute story and very entertaining. Better than a lot of other high school romcoms."
"381","The Kissing Booth",8,"Better than the book","I've recently read the book and the differences they made for the film better.Noah and Elle and have great chemistry. 
Fun and re-watchable."
"382","The Kissing Booth",1,"Awful message for teens","It is hard to believe that, in 2018, this kind of movie is accepted and promoted. It is full of cliches and has a bad storyline, but the worst thing is the message for girls. I hope Joey King finds better scripts to work with. She's a fine actress"
"383","The Kissing Booth",1,"Don't waste your time","The plot is weak, dumb and pretty pointless. It just glorifies high school drinking, sex, and really stupid humor."
"384","The Kissing Booth",2,"no thank you","I'm sorry but, who asked for another white boy with anger issues?"
"385","The Kissing Booth",10,"Surprised","If I'm being completely honest this was one of the best movies on Netflix by far. I was expecting this to be another ""Netflix"" movie but it completely proved me wrong. I liked the story even though you could kinda anticipate what was going to happen next it was well put together and wasn't too cheesy. Highly recommend!"
"386","The Kissing Booth",8,"Feel good movie","This movie had all the right romance. Which now a days it's hard to find. I would definitely recommend this to any movie lover. It had that true love feeling. I would have gave it a 10 star but there was a few things that didn't fit right."
"387","The Kissing Booth",7,"Teen movie","I wouldn't recommend this movie if you want to see good writing, (but acting not too bad) it's very cheesy but I love the romance genre of this movie it's very relatable
It's a coming of age movie, it's a massive teen movie and a very girly movie
I would recommend this film with your girlfriends it's a very happy sweet and cheesy film"
"388","The Kissing Booth",3,"Exceptionally standard","The Kissing Booth is arguably the most unoriginal movie of this year. If your taste in movies has matured ever so slightly since you were in sixth grade, I'd advice you to watch anything but this."
"389","The Kissing Booth",3,"only watched it halfway so correct me if Im wrong, but","It started off cute, really, but cheesus, I cannot understand how elles mind supposed to work as only halfway and she already flashes so much in front of guys, and them liking it that much makes elle seems like a slutty girl, and isnt she supposed to be a teenager outgrowing puberty so she gets very concious about her body and stuff? God this film is really sending a wrong message. Judging by targerted viewers, I hope kids dont watch this and get the wrong idea like if u show much skin u finally get noticed and attentions and love from guys and yabayaba. I mean its possible, but isnt it NOT inspiring?"
"390","The Kissing Booth",10,"Loved it","A good light hearted romantic romp. First of all Elle, I thought she was well played.insted of a crying whiney drama queen she took her life with a good hearted laugh. Lee was her friend /unofficial brother, he was well played fun and funny. As for Noah in my opinion he brought chivalry back to the big screen with a good hearted laugh and good on him. I really enjoyed the fact that the leading lady was short with a real body not every film has to have a tall woman with a skinny body. And the guy was tall with a naughty smile that would melt rocks at 10 paces. I liked it and would like a follow up with the original cast."
"391","The Kissing Booth",2,"wow this is bad","I honestly made an account just to say wow. This movie is bad. The acting sucks and the plot has so many holes that it doesn't make sense to anyone with more that 3 brain cells. If you're looking for a ""girl's night in"" flick, please watch something a little more intelligent? For the sake of female pride? This movie makes girls look like idiots who go weak at the knees every time a relatively not ugly guy looks their way. The plot is made from cheese with poorly delivered lines--like the actors themselves hated saying them. The only reason this movie gets a two is because the kissing is hot. But otherwise--don't waste your time."
"392","The Kissing Booth",10,"Love this movie","I think they should make a The kissing booth #2 about where Noah and Elle get married and have kids and stuff"
"393","The Kissing Booth",8,"Good movie","A hunk who does not play it cool and plays it straight. No games, no teasing, no strategies, just tells it like it is to the girl he wants on his terms. Makes her happy he is so frank and strong. A fun movie with a positive message."
"394","The Kissing Booth",1,"Save me Jesus.","I'm not kidding, this is one of the worst things I have ever seen. If you love torturing yourself then definitely watch this, it has some sweet, sweet cringe."
"395","The Kissing Booth",8,"Cute movie!","Watched it 3 times and read the book. Adorable story. Great chemistry. Decent acting though a bit cringe in some scenes. As far as people saying Noah is abusive... He's overprotective clearly, but Elle stands her ground well. I also read something about this movie being problematic because of the sex, drinking, and sexism. Sigh. Go watch a Disney movie."
"396","The Kissing Booth",8,"Cute movie","I enjoyed it throughly. Don't think much and watch it. It's a cute story of a cute girl and dangerously handsome boy. Lol"
"397","The Kissing Booth",6,"The Kissing Booth - Movie Review","The Kissing Booth is an extremely average film, but I'd be lying if I said that it didn't have a certain charm to it. I've seen it twice so far, and I haven't regretted my time on either occasion.The film is far from perfect, but the dynamic between the actors is the glue that holds it all together. Joey King, Jacob Elordi, and Joel Courtney are all great in their roles, even if the dialogue was a little rough at times.The narrative was decent, but nothing too special and it was stuffed with clichés. A lot of the film revolves around the sexualisation of Shelly, and this didn't sit right with me. It felt as if they were shaming girls for sleeping around and congratulating guys who did the same. This might not be an issue for most people, but they went out of their way to have Shelly take off her clothes a lot. This doesn't usually bother me, but it was very distracting.The soundtrack is catchy, some of the visuals were nice, and the editing was strong. There are a lot of elements which made The Kissing Booth a worthy watch, and I'm looking forward to checking out the sequel, but there were too many negatives to say that it's a particularly good film.Overall, if you like rom-coms and you can overlook the poorly written screenplay and narrative clichés, you might have a good time with the film. It was never boring, and so it gets a mild recommendation.SCORE: 62%"
"398","The Kissing Booth",4,"I probably would've liked this movie when I was 14","This movie is definitely something that a younger crowd would like, but it also gives them the wrong message. How controlling Elle's crush Noah is makes me feel really uncomfortable. It reminds me of how some of my bad teenage boyfriends acted. The problem isn't showing controlling relationships, but this movie is trying to convey them as a sexy thing. I wouldn't let my daughter watch this... I'm not offended easily by any means, but this was very cringey. - other than that, the movie is an okay but cheesy rom com. Some of my friends recommended it so obviously a lot of people like it, wasn't for me though."
"399","The Kissing Booth",NA,"Cringe","There are so much cliches in this movie. Terrible to watch. If reminds me so much of twilight and fiffty shades which are also very much alike.."
"400","The Kissing Booth",5,"Same old story","This story has been done time after time. Forced acting. Horrible attempt to match Elle (Joey King) with Noah (Jacob Elordi). There is NO chemistry between these two. Totally unrealistic. Prom scene is almost a rip off of Pretty in Pink. Maybe with a different lead actress this would have been a much better movie. Nothing new here to watch, keep on moving."
"401","365 Days",1,"What did I just watch?","I honestly can't believe this is an actual movie and number 1 on Netflix in my country."
"402","365 Days",1,"I made an account to give this movie a bad review","This was probably the worst movie I've ever seen.
The dialogues between the main characters are unbelievably cringy and the plot literally doesn't make any sense. Don't watch this movie unless you wanna waste 2 hours of your life just to give this movie a (probably) 1 star rating too."
"403","365 Days",1,"Are you lost baby girl?","The cringe levels runeth over. The English is almost as bad as the plot. If you want to watch this movie do so as a drinking game. Did you cringe? Then take a shot my dude. You will be wasted by the end."
"404","365 Days",1,"Insanity","I honestly don't know who thought that this movie would be a good idea. It is a complete train wreck for multiple reasons.One of the biggest issues is the plot is just nonsense. It is inappropriate to have a man deiced that he will hold a woman captive and she will love him. That is just not ok and i don't know why they made a movie romanticising this idea. The male character is a creep. He assaults the female character multiple times and it is not shown as a bad thing. It's just like he is a man and he has power so he can do what he likes. It is really really bad. Beyond that they just do variations of the same scene 6 different times. This movie is just the same scene over and over again broken up with random montages with a song played over it.The actions of the characters are nonsensical too. She has been kidnapped in a foreign country and then the next day there is a shopping montage where she is just like ""woo lets go buy some new clothes"". Like that just wouldn't happen, you would be terrified and she just acts like fine with it. I feel like they try to get the audience on side by making her current boyfriend a horrible person. I think they think the audience will be like ""oh that's good she got away from him"". Yeah she did get away from her bad boyfriend...by being kidnapped by an Italian mobster who is holding her captive????The second issue is the leads can't act and a lot of the movie is just them interacting so its like watching an amateur dramatics troupe half of the time. Now i can't work this out but this woman who is kidnapped never seems scared like at all. I can't deiced if this was the direction she was given or she just can't act or the script said she isn't scared. She literally wakes up after being kidnapped and tried to open the door to get out, can't because its locked and is just like ""Yeah fair enough"" and just sits down like this happens every day.On top of that the scenes with the male lead pushing her against walls and stuff she pulls like ""Posing, modelling"" faces and is not like ""Jesus Christ the man is assaulting me help"". Once again was this the direction or was it the acting who's knows?It also relies heavily on ""Pop"" songs that are really loud and unnecessary. They constantly play one after the other and then when reading i found out the male lead sung like a big chunk of them so i guess production was just like ""well he will give us them cheep let's throw them all in"".I could go one about all its problems but it all circles back to the directing, acting and the script. It was just a perfect storm.Believe it or not it is watchable but in a way that you want to watch it to see the disaster. It is the no1 viewed film on a large amount of different countries Netflix's at the moment and i believe this to be the reason.So its really up to you if you want to watch it. It is very boring but also a train wreck."
"405","365 Days",1,"Straight up porn- no judgement.","I do not even know where to start. Look, this is nothing but straight up porn. The plot is ridiculous, the chemistry between the two leads is nonexistent, and the acting is even worse. Trust me when I say, you will watch this in fast forward. It is that horrible!"
"406","365 Days",5,"Wattpad 100%","I have read a few stories on the app and this movie is definitely a good reason why some books should never make it on the screen.
It was fun but ridiculous and pathetic."
"407","365 Days",3,"Spoiler alert: it's pretty bad","I don't remember if I have reviewed another movie so far, but seeing so many 10/10 reviews determined me to log in to write this, to ballance things up a bit.The movie is pretty bad. The plot (if you can call it that) is mostly absurd and the events are cliche and totally predictable (try to remember what somebody did or said in all the bad movies that you ever saw: yes, it's exactly what's going to happen), the events don't make a lot of sense, the dialogue is cringe, the characters are very cartoonish and unbelievable. What they say don't make a lot of sense, and also nobody reacts to events in the way a normal person would do. These are comic book characters, not people. When they try to suggest some of these people are crime lords it's hilarious, you can't help but chuckle. Real mobsters would have these guys for breakfast. Ironically, the fly girls in the movie are actually more believable, because the way they live it is more close to some girls I know.I never saw any of the ""Shades of Gray"" movies, but for a good part it felt like a relative of those movies. The sex scenes are pretty convincing, I'm still unsure if the oral sex was actually simulated or not.The good things I can say about this are (and each gets a star from me):
the photography is pretty good, at least the cinematographer knew what he was doingthe actors are generally pretty easy on the eye, the costumes are also solid, there are nice and diverse locations, hence there is always something appealing to look at on the screenthe sex scenes are pretty good if you're into that kind of thing (I am)Should you see it? Well I don't know, even with the low score that I gave it, I feel like people should make up their own mind and not take someone's else opinion on it. Besides, I think people should watch bad movies from time to time, to be able to understand better why other movies are good, and to be more appreciative of those, as a consequence.So yeah, go watch it, but keep your expectations ridiculously low."

What i liked is she is open-minded and can be persuaded.

"409","365 Days",1,"Toxic","Such stupid, worthless, toxic story line . Glorification of relationships where the sole role of a woman is to be a slave and fulfill the desires of a harsh , egotistic ,rich male character."
"410","365 Days",NA,"Er, I Will go Against The Grain","I liked it. I enjoyed it. What's not to like? He loves me, gives me pleasure, gives me money, a boat and lets me go shopping. Good movie and allowed me to fantasize.
And I have a choice.
And I can have a baby too.What I don't like then? Actually, Massimo. Do not like his face and the beard has to go.
Also, the music. Why was it so disconnected to the plot and so loud. I could not hear them talk or make love!"
"411","365 Days",6,"Sequal of Shades Movies?","What I have to say, don't know. I didn't find any plot or story yet it was engaging."
"412","365 Days",NA,"positive reviews are all fake single use accounts. Lead male character has all the sex appeal of Harvey Weinstein.","Seriously, I am not a politically correct, ""woke"" or outraged person.But the idea that a scumbag mafia guy, is going to sexually assault his way into a woman's heart is not just absurd, but simply disgusting.Think Christopher Moltisante's ""Cleaver"" script within Sopranos with no dramatic irony. My guess is this film was financed by mafioso types. Exactly what attributes does this mafia leader have? He has brutishness, but he has no cunning, no leadership skills, and is not credible as someone who would rise through the ranks in anything, including organized crime.
He is about as sexy as a toad.The acting, dialogue, plot and cinematography are just amazingly bad and cringe-worthy. The makers of this spent more time shilling the review section here than they did writing this junk."
"413","365 Days",4,"Euro chick party movie with sex to keep guys interested","Outraged woke people will obviously 1 star this movie.The guy is a brute, and the girl acts strong, but loves that hes a brute.People complain about the English... the English is fine if youre from Europe. Woke people angry its not directed at their country. Surprise!Its a chick flick full of girls partying with no consequences, drink, spa, drink, dancing, drink all while someone else pays for it. Seems accurate.On top of that, there is a lot of sex in the movie. Very 50 shades sex, but naked bodies on screen so guys wont immediately turn off how the irresponsible, party girl movie.Was it the worst? No, probably would have been pretty popular 10 years ago. Was it good? Meh, I was engaged through to the end, but no. It wasnt that good and the ending is very... oh, ok.Verdict, watch it once with your girlfriend/boyfriend. It will probably get you hot and heavy... unless youre woke and outraged at everything."

The director has chosen the right characters to fulfill the roles and writers have done a well satisfying job in writing. You won't get bored even for a single minute and if you're a romantic lover, you'll love this movie. The dialogues are really romantic and attractive that you will not be able to blink for a moment. The ending also satisfying and unexpected.Other good films if you liked this one: in The Realm Of Senses, The Vow, Lost In Beijing and of course Fifty Shades Of Grey."

"419","365 Days",9,"I loved this movie, but probably because I like erotic fantasy.","First off, I must say I loved the 50 shade books, but thought the movies were so so. If this movie was this good, I can't wait for the books to be published in English. Polish people went all in. Now, it's not exactly like 50 shades, but it's the same principal: cat and mouse game. I know people are confused on why people and women in particular love this movie. It's a fantasy, yes, it's not real, we know that, but that doesn't matter. It's a safe fantasy in our minds because it's in a movie and not real. Michele who plays Mossimo does an amazing job, better than Jamie did with Christian Gray. He fits the role to a tee.As for the ending, this is part of a trilogy. Once people understand that, the ending makes sense. It's not over and I CAN NOT wait for #2.At the end of this day, this movie is not meant to win awards. It's meant to be a feel good movie and it gives millions of women all over the world, the feels and it hits the mark. Especially since we are in quarantine, we need a movie that takes us away.For anyone who doesn't understand this movie, they don't understand erotic fantasy. This movie is not for everyone! But it is for millions of people all over the world!"
"420","365 Days",10,"Mob boss ..,.true Sicilian playing the part well!!","The Mafia boss spoke perfect Sicilian. Acted like s true mob boss but lost his head when it came to that girl. If the story line continued with him and exactly what the crime business was it would have been more interesting. I gave it a 10 because of the lead actor playing the part of Massimo. Very well known actor in Italy,"

Because the plot of the story gives the viewer a different way to have a love.
Besides, this is the romantic movie not a action or drama.
This movie give you a different experience how to get love from your lover.
The ending make you feel twist because if this movie not make a sequel, the audience must read the novel to know the real ending.
Good movie from good novel adaptation"
"427","365 Days",8,"Organized Naggers","Sorry, Iit is a great movie.If you thought all modern movies were boring, stop right there because you will love this film. The background of the polish woman is barely shown, but from there this is a different way, having the actor and actress filling the blanks of the path they take to love. No passage is hidden, but the add-ons of the director makes this story so interesting you will want to repeat it. The relation between boyfriend ( a man), the in-demand woman (a woman) and the Polish boyfriend (not even a man) is taken to a different level.Women and men will enjoy."

"431","365 Days",8,"Why Watch it If You Do Not Like The Genre?","The oldest review is rather shameful...it's not indoctrination to tell us the truth and what turns men on and turns women to lust. The movie's good and worth seeing. It's great that it got a theatrical release, considering the junk in Hollywood today that hides women's body like Hollywood is in league with ISIS. Also I don't agree that it trivializes the story at all."

There are times that my phallus just does not rise to the occasion. Time for outside help!
We watch good erotic movies like this and at night we satisfy each other as I am in fantasy land and she is enjoying my renewed energy. This is that kind of a movie. Win-win.

"435","365 Days",7,"7/10","We liked it as a family
Everyone in my family liked this movie, me, wifeand kids, ages 13, 11 and 9. A couple of inappropriate sexual parts, mainly at beginning so easy to skip past or talk over. We watched from home but would def go to theater for sequel. It is hard to find movies that we can enjoy as adults and we are okay with kids watching. I see there are poor reviews but it is a fun sexy movie we thought. Loved the girl power because she is a given a choice and she makes one. I don't know why it is lower reviewed but society does seem to put down female empowerment movies, especially when they are more sexy rather than fulfilling cliche mainstream stuff. Anyway, we would recommend and will watch again."
"436","365 Days",9,"Story line was good but needs more","Storyline over all was good, could of been a bit more detailed but the action of erotica was awesome. It was a bit smutty but I liked it, it was mysterious, sexy, hit, steamy and as the movie plot kept going (not just the R rated scenes) it got more and more interesting. It left me wanting more and I can not wait till part 2 .. more detail in the plot itself would be good for part 2"
"437","365 Days",10,"Loved it!","Yeah, the story line could have been slightly better, but I couldn't stop watching it! Reminds of me of fifty shades of grey, but naughtier!

The ""erotic"" scenes seem so forced and compared to 50 shades it just is not on the same level.The guy is so creepy and doesn't even come across in a seductive way, just an extremely awkward, overly aggressive control freak!The people who made this movie should be ashamed of themselves, it has to be ranked in the top 10 worst movies of all time, it certainly can claim the crown of the cringiest movie ever made.Just wow."
"475","365 Days",NA,"Straight up material girl who gets bought - no judgement","I do not even know where to start. Look, this is nothing but straight up sexy materialism. The plot is normal, the chemistry between the two leads is sexy and alluring, and the acting is natural. Trust me when I say, you will watch this and be very hot and horny. It is that good."
"476","365 Days",10,"This film is not for feminists!","I never watch a film twice but I have already watched this film two times. And the second time was as good as first time. The sex scenes are so real and Michele Morrone is perfect for this movie."
"477","365 Days",NA,"Epic romance-melodrama that hits (almost) all the right notes","The most amazing thing about ""365 days"" is that, despite all of its shortcomings (some of them glaringly obvious), the film still manages to come out on top.Yes, the film is derivative in places. (But then what did you expect of yet another Fifty Shades movie in 2018?) The director borrows heavily from every male and female fantasy, Melville's Le Samourai and Cassavetes' Gloria, especially in the last 30 minutes. But before that it quickly takes a shape all its own. And yes, there are some huge holes in logic but ""365 days"" must be seen more as a modernist fairy-tale than a gritty thriller in order to makes sense.Laura and Massimo are foremost anchored by the three (yes, that's right!) lead performances, all brilliantly framed by the sexy and stylized direction. All three actors and actresses give highly emotional performances unlike anything you have ever seen before. And despite their characters having opposing agendas or being downright antagonist they all seem to be part of the same family. All of their (re-)actions make sense, if judged purely from an emotional POV.This setup is actually strongly reminiscent of spaghetti westerns but adds sex and it is obvious throughout the film that this was a big influence - from the close-up mug shots to the theme-heavy pop score. The director injects a modern style that is partly influenced by 50 Shades, John Woo and french ""cinema du look"", creating a hybrid that is totally original.If you are afraid of nature and sex then you will be afraid of this movie.
I am glad to see that it is ranked so highly on Netflix signalling a silent majority of sexually liberated viewers."
"478","365 Days",1,"Totally garbage from the beginning to the end.","Don't waste you time on this, it's about nothing and end about being nothing no story at all no acting at all"
"479","365 Days",2,"Incredibly bad","Laura, from Warsaw, and her boyfriend head to Sicily for a holiday. There she meets Massimo, the young leader of a local Mafia family. He is immediately smitten by her and kidnaps her, takes her back to his estate and holds her captive. He gives her 365 days to fall in love with him.Incredibly bad: weak story, dull and wafer-thin plot. Doesn't work on any level.Not sure who the target audience is. If you want a good story, there isn't much of a plot. If you want a good gangster/crime drama, that element takes up maybe 5-10% of the movie. If you want a romantic drama: what part of a woman being kidnapped by a knuckle-headed hoodlum and yet somehow falling in love with him is romantic, or even plausible? If you want an erotic drama, this will only work if you're a teenager and/or you don't have access to the internet.I assume this was made to cash in on the inexplicable success of Fifty Shades of Grey. On that note, as bad as Fifty Shades of Grey is, 365 Days makes that look like a masterpiece."
"480","365 Days",1,"Ughhhhhh","This movie makes me embarrassed to be a polish citizen. It singlehandedly set back women some 20 years purely by existing. There's nothing I can say that other reviews haven't said already. The single positive thing is the fashion, it was quite good, and wow that was hard to say."
"481","365 Days",6,"It's a chick flick","Rate it as such. Before watching i heard a lot of that it is terrible etc, and my expectations were really low. It wasnt so bad! Plot is not too good, acting is ok, camerawork is kinda good, ending was actually quite surprising in a good way, and hey, its made for women. Multilinguality was also a plus. Not so bad as they call it."
"482","365 Days",7,"It is not a bad movie","It's not a bad movie at all! Ignore the bad reviews. It looks like the work of a spammer (unattractive tattooed chubster?) It doesn't have to be to the taste of every adult movie fan who seeks natural love making. You will get amused from beginning till the end. Let me brief you on the movie. All the movie is a game of seduction played by a tattooed thug on a slender pretty babe who is on holiday, so she is ripe for the party. He is a fat tattooed mafioso man therefor, shelters the soaked girls and satisfies her sexually and materially, she is fertile too."
"483","365 Days",8,"Get a grip folks","This ipure fantasy, not to be taken seriously.

This movie should be destroyed!"
"486","365 Days",9,"Top movie in the erotic genre","One of those rare movies in the erotic genre that stand above the rest. Much better than 50 Shades of Grey. This one is actually truly erotic, nice settings too and made both for man and women. Only drawback of the movie is that the story is very predictable without any twists. But most movies are these days."
"487","365 Days",1,"Illegal","Who wrote this plot then decided it was okay?!? I mean this man not only kidnaps a girl and forces her to love him, but has horrible one liners. Twilight was toxic but this takes it to another level. I kept excepting him to murder her. But he was attractive so u guess him being crazy and a stalker doesn't matter."
"488","365 Days",1,"Softcore Porn Rape-Fantasy","This movie is porn for Karens who think they're too good to watch actual porn, so they watch this ridiculous rape-fantasy garbage instead (another example being 50 Shades of Grey). Of course, filmmaking wise, it's an insult to everyone's intelligence and has some of the worst production I've ever seen. I can't believe Netflix is paying money to stream this. I've seen pornos that are legitimately better films."

"497","365 Days",7,"Sometimes a good movie comes along","I don't know what's in the head of the spammer here. The movie looks great and is totally amusing. I only watch it because my friend recommended it and she was right. Many do not watch this for the story. The plot is fun and different though. If you always watch good movies, you should add this to your list, If you have no taste for love, sex and erotica and are unnatural then stay away.

"498","365 Days",1,"Does these people have common sense?","Despite the stupidity and the many holes in this movie, we all know it belongs to somewhere else and it's not Netflix"
"499","365 Days",1,"Very bad","This is the ""The Room"" of erotic movies. It all has an overall cheap feel to it. At a certain point it begins to feel as a musical too. There's a BJ scene with rock and roll in it that made me consider hanging myself with my belt. It feels like the script for this was written by an underage WattPad user. I'm impressed Netflix would put out such hot garbage. Giving the equipment used and image quality is so high and the movie quality is so bad I'm willing to believe that the director is just a well connected rich person."
"500","365 Days",1,"A degrading bag of trash","This film basically acts like the sexist and pitiful dreams of a loser who has never interacted with women or anybody else for that matter without having ulterior motives. I can't even put into words how sad and ridiculous the idea behind this movie is and the execution of it is somehow even worse.If the director is not some creepy old guy who just wanted to make his own softcore porno I'm confused"
"501","Greyhound",9,"Deja-vu for a 92 year old destroyer officer!","I served on a destroyer during the Korean War. This movie really captured the excitement of being on the bridge during convoy duty."
"502","Greyhound",9,"Intense, compressed, brief...","Having served in the Cold War on both a destroyer and on a submarine, I found this story contrasting the tensions between both worlds. The action is shown from the bridge, CIC, and decks of the Greyhound, which BTW is the slang term for destroyers and those who serve on them. Hanks subtly conveys the ache of leaving a loved one behind and her presence with him during the battle. He and his crew feel the presence of the subs stalking the surface ships and the deaths of sailors both above and below the icy water. There is no perfect rendering of combat in film, but the repeated commands and protocols between naval personnel and vessels are accurate enough to convey a sense of proper urgency to the story. Compressing roughly 48 tense hours into a ~2 hour film doesn't give much time to absorb all that's happening, and that's the point. Training and subsequent reactions shape the story in the faces of the bridge crew as they watch the captain and follow his orders which he does not explain. This is about relationships between combatants, among the ships in the convoy, and between U.S. and British allies. This film, The Enemy Below, and Das Boot make a reasonable trilogy for a weekend marathon. Enjoy this story from either a technical or a relational view as you see fit."
"503","Greyhound",7,"Entertaining movie without over doing it","Spectacle? Dramatization? No. This movie allowed me to experience ww2 naval combat without the bombast of the usual action movie. It felt realistic with a decent amount of suspense, a glimpse through the eyes of the captain."
"504","Greyhound",9,"A great procedural movie, and a great tribute","This is a movie about the procedure of command. This is an innately more complex task than the more common episodic approach that buries the procedural reality under a mask of plot and character. But this film pulls it off, largely by not shying away from the task.Guess what? Naval warfare, especially the sort of highly asymmetric warfare shown here, doesn't really revolve around the captain demanding more speed while the engineer says she canna take it. If you're looking for a movie that's truly respectful of the labours and sacrifices made in the Battle of the Atlantic, then this is a fitting tribute.Don't expect a character movie, don't expect to spend time below decks exploring the usual stereotypes. This movie is seen through the eyes of the captain, and the captain alone. I can think of very few other films that dare to depict the loneliness of command quite so clearly. There's little time for thought, there's no time to process or even truly grasp the horrors that they encounter (something which forms one of the roots of PTSD). What there is is the fight.The fight is relentless and deeply technical. We've become used to fight scenes carrying a few bits of technical gibberish followed by some visceral and personalised action. There's no gibberish in this film, and the latter consists of the captain cutting his feet on broken glass. The movie, like the mind of the captain, is consumed with the intricate technical and personal demands required to hunt down a submarine at that time. That was clearly the aim here, and the movie has succeeded admirably at showing that particular aspect of this type of warfare. This is not a common way to stage a war movie, but it's worth doing well on a few occasions, and this movie achieves its goal.The reviews show that many come looking for something more conventional, and end up missing the point, which is a shame."
"505","Greyhound",8,"I wish it was significantly longer...","Honestly, I decided to write a review to counter some of the more trivial reviews found in this thread and to try and present an objective perspective of this film.Firstly, the dialogue in this movie is typical for a movie depicting World War II Naval life and is accurate to the time period. Do not watch this film if you expect anything other than period correct Naval terminology or the constant passing of orders between the captain and the crew, as you are not going to be satisfied with this movie. Ninety percent of the dialogue in this movie relates to the business of conducting asymmetrical naval combat in a high-speed situation and is way too short to have a grand introspective or extrospective expose on the psychology of warfare or one's place in the world. Sadly, the short length of this film prevents any adequate amount of time dedicated to forging interesting and dynamic characters or a complex plot with a villain that was somewhat pointless. If anything, the director should have lengthened the film to expound upon the narrative and bring our cautious, somewhat hesitant, captain to life or pick a handful of critical Sailors to develop a relationship with within 80-minute time constraint.Secondly, there are better movies or shows that depict the Battle of the Atlantic which brings me to my second point. If anything; this film should have been broken into a mini-series, like Das Boot or a full feature series like Band of Brothers or The Pacific. Had the directors decided to embark upon that route, we could have had a significantly stronger plot and been able to identify with the characters in a more empathetic way. As a former United States Navy Sailor, I felt right at home with the style, accuracy, and briskness with which the film endeavored to portray. However, I did not find myself overly attached to any of the featured characters. In fact, the film attempts to ""show"" us that we should feel shocked, saddened, or disheartened by the plight of these Sailors, however, without any in-depth character development, I found it difficult for me to feel any more than somewhat saddened, and by the time that I did experience this emotion, the movie moved onto another chaotic event. Reflecting upon the movie now, maybe that is the point of the plot? Maybe, the film tries to showcase that the chaos of battle does not grant us a moment of emotional expression aside from the adrenaline rush of combat or a life-threatening event. In any case, if you are looking for significant character development, and a grander view of the Battle of the Atlantic at large, this is certainly not the film for you.Lastly, I do not, in any capacity, feel like I wasted an hour and half of my life like some of the other viewers felt. For me, it was a nostalgic trip back into an old life that I long forgotten and I enjoyed every minute of this film despite its shortcomings. Has Tom Hanks done better? Certainly. Did I think he did a poor job with this film? Absolutely not. While my main complaint is that this film could have been significantly longer, I am left with a desire to want to explore more in regards to the treacherous Battle of the Atlantic and the men of all nations who participated.Overall - I was pleasantly surprised with this movie, and while I felt that this film could have been produced as its own mini-series in order to develop the plot and the characters better, I thoroughly enjoyed my time, and I am sure I will return to it again in the future.Enjoy!"
"506","Greyhound",8,"Short and sweet","Loved the authenticity and general faithfulness to the technical side of naval warfare. For me, this is a great movie, I love seeing small little details in how the captain commands his vessel, and every crewman doing their job, and quick glances to the CiC trying to keep track of enemy vessels. The movie didn't need to show the crewman following the captain around and repeating every word that Sonar/Radar reports, but it does so and adds a very nice detail that I found to be great, and also helped build the stress and tension everyone was under.My only complaint is that the movie could have been longer. I could definately have watched a 3 hour version of this that took it slower in the style of Das Boot. Other than that, I recommend this movie for anyone that loves the more technical parts of warfare and especially naval vessels."
"507","Greyhound",6,"Technically right but ... something missing","Though the movie might have been right on technical terms , it somehow did not unleash the potential it hadI felt the movie could have been longer with a better depiction of the enemy to understand the details on strategy betterThe climax (if any) was not up to the markU571 and Das Boot had done a better job long time agoHowever in these time of pandamic with nothing new in the offering; this is worth a watch"
"508","Greyhound",9,"Great movie","Finally a movie that isn't conventional. We don't have to have character dev. This is a movie about war. If you need a backstory, learn some freaking history because it's pathetic how dumb Americans have gotten when it comes to history. The war in the Atlantic was very long and would be hard to make a movie out of it. How this movie is done, shows how the captains and crew would hunt and destroy Nazi u boats in that era. I'm glad the movie wasn't over 2 hrs like everything else in today's time. If you want to learn what it was like crossing the Atlantic during WW2, this movie is for you. If not, then yea I guess you'll say it's missed potential. I'd have to disagree, though"
"509","Greyhound",5,"Good reenactment of a WWII sea battle, but nothing else really","Good production, quite intense, very interesting reenactment of a battle at sea, although I am not sure how realistic and accurate it is (those submarines liked to fight a lot in plain sight over the water, right?).My main issue? It was like a documentary, lots of battle time but no much human drama. No time given to develop any characters or even make us feel something about these people.
Ships were sinking in the middle of the Atlantic and we never had a look in the horror of trying to survive this. Even Hank's character felt flat. The few scenes with his love interest were rather awkward and didn't contribute much. At one point we were wondering if the captain was in the spectrum or something..Still, if you are a fan of WWII movies I suggest to watch it for the unique perspective of a battle at sea."
"510","Greyhound",6,"Wanted to Like This More than I Did","It was just OK which is reflected in my 6 star rating, which I think is generous. They made little effort at any sort of character development. Hanks has some sort of love interest that is hinted at, but that's it. I thought they were going to build some sort of bond between the captain and his Black cook, but that never got off the ground. We know almost nothing more about the man at the end than in the beginning.It's a difficult challenge to portray on film the battle between a destroyer and a submarine. This movie never really pulls that off, it's like listening to one side of a telephone conversation. The German U-boats never seem to be part of the narrative. They try to bring the U-boats in with their radio broadcasts which come across more as obscene phone calls than viable dialogue.Almost exactly half of the dialogue is sailors repeating orders. It got very tedious, very quickly. I thought they went too far in the whole ""navy talk"" department.I found the U-boat attack theme music to be mostly bothersome and heavy-handed, like death wail of a fat man, or a runner-up in Dumb and Dumber's most annoying sound in the world.The sea burial onboard was a moving tribute to our military dead. I couldn't imagine a better resting place than the open sea. I was air force and not really sure what we did. Threw bodies out the back of a C130? That'd be cool with me."
"511","Greyhound",3,"Dull Thud...","One of my most anticipated 2020 films lands with a dull thud. Excluding credits, this movie is 78 minutes long... and 75 of those minutes are spent listening to Hanks scream orders like, ""Left Full Rudder! Bearing Two Niner Zero! Hard to Starboard!"" There is zero character development... and Elisabeth Shue (who gets second billing) has exactly 15 seconds of screen-time. What a disappointment."
"512","Greyhound",5,"Missed potential","If you have no attraction to military procedure then this film has no selling points.
No backstory or character development. Tedious action and boring dialogue.Back story is no longer then a couple minuets of naval captain leaving lover to go to war.
The rest of the movie is just naval commands I wish I was joking but this film is 80 minuets of rudder left rudder right and sonar positions.Only positive is the film look amazing the visual departments knocked it out of the park.Music was disappointing just generic tension music.This film had potential to be so much better. But the simple fact is there is no major story yet it's some how stretched out over 80 minuets of boring."
"513","Greyhound",6,"It had potential","I had great expectations as I had just finished season 2 of Das Boot. I was disapointed. It fails to even come close to the suspense and the horror of the battles in the Atlantic during WW2. Watch Das Boot instead."
"514","Greyhound",8,"I Think They Shortened it - But Great Movie","I am pretty sure that there were some extra scenes that were cut out of this movie as i remember watching the trailer a while back and seeing more of an introduction to the command and the Naval journey.That said, this movie was very well done. It does cut out a lot of the slow drama and build up that a lot of these movies have, and it gets right into the heart of the action from the start. For some that may be a bad thing, but i found that it just captured my attention quicker as many movies often make too much out of the prelude to the action scenes.The scenery and CGI was nicely done and Tom Hanks was excellent. This wasn't a fancy movie with a big shocking ending, it was a nice steady action movie. It keeps you hooked and you feel like you are truly along for the ride. The drama and relationships to the characters is subtle but it is there. I would say it was definitely an emotional journey - one that made you connect to the loss of life that was experienced on these journeys.A very good job from Mr Hanks - not Oscar worthy - but one to watch again and again !"
"515","Greyhound",8,"Very entertaining","A lot of nautical talk and directions/distances, but very thrilling and one of the better war movies made I'd say. I'd rank Dunkirk, saving private Ryan , and hacksaw ridge ahead of this. But then this is right behind those."
"516","Greyhound",6,"Greyhound review","Actually there is not much good things to say it, the film is kind of immersive, they try to make you feel like you are in the same environment of the characters, but even some good scenes, especially the first chase scene which have some suspense and the score is good in that part but also kinda look like a copy from Dunkirk original score, the whole film don't actually doesn't work very well.Tom Hanks can't give a bad performance, is nice that his character is a religious person and of course as a capitan noboby is going to make fun of that in front of him, and is good to see him in a war movie, but i also would like to see more the inside of the ship, the oher characters preparing to launch the bombs, kinda like that scene in Titanic that shows the people working in the underground of the ship.Also the CGI doesn't work very well, the film looks too clean and the editing is not good, for example in the begining of the film they cut to a scene of someone drawing a swastika, and the way they did looks like it was in the american ship, is very strange."
"517","Greyhound",4,"Why?","My question at the end of the movie was ""Why?""
Why make a movie about such a thin plot? Now, its rather difficult to make these comments about such dramatic events; but we are supposed here to review and rate a movie, not the bravery of those who fought and died in the events told by the movie.
So my question stands; on top of its thin plot, the movie has virtually no dialogues except a series of orders
""Right standard rudder!"" ""Right standard rudder, aye aye!""
""Steady ahead on 091!"" ""Steady ahead on 091, aye aye!""
""Contact bearing port 015, range 900 yards!""
Repeat the above dozens of times and you have 95% of the dialogues of the movie.
Character development is virtually inexistent as it is impossible in a movie like this; even Ha ks performance is just about OK.
So, why make a movie like this?"
"518","Greyhound",9,"History uncovered","This was a part of history I had no knowledge of. Fascinating study of a man, a leader"
"519","Greyhound",5,"It was beautiful... but the plot was just meh","No Character development.... I didn't find myself caring for anyone and in these kind of movies I usually find one or two I connect with.... there were nice battles but... there was no plot around it at all..I surprised Tom starred in this... It seemed destined for the B Bin..."
"520","Greyhound",8,"Enjoyable summer treat.","Was this a great film? Not quite. But for what it was it was very well done. Excellent performances by Hanks and the entire cast. One of the greatest war movies? No. But given the dearth of entertainment options this season an enjoyable (but short) little feast."
"521","Greyhound",10,"An excellent, nothing extra, war film that hits on one very important note","As a made-for-streaming movie, this is exceptional. As a war film in general, it's still really good. At 90 minutes long, there's no time for a love story, drawn out character development or pandering to today's issues. Only enough time to hit on a few key messages regarding WWII and ship battles.One of them struck me personally. At one point the captain makes a questionable mistake which costs lives. A mistake that any good man would make. Though his actions otherwise cause him to be later applauded a hero, the captain believes he could have done better. A simple message but this film delivers it so subtly and accurately, Hanks nails it.My Grandfather is a WWII veteran, decorated with honors from the US and France. Yet, in the few times he has talked about his part in the war, he tends to focus most on his one mistake and has never talked about any victories for which he is decorated. This is common among war veterans and this movie touches on it perfectly without saying anything and helps me better understand my grandfather.Well worth the tiny price of streaming admission."
"522","Greyhound",7,"A Slice of History Done Well!","An enthralling non-stop sea battle action flik that delivers all the right blows - if you will excuse the pun.Even though there is absolutely no character development, the film worked well. From the action, the special effects amd the overall storytelling, which for the record, Tom Hanks did very well when writing the screenplay. A slice of history well portrayedA blasting 7 out of 10 stars for this film that could have seen 2 more stars if there was a more in-depth story to the opening and closing that would have supported the core of the film."
"523","Greyhound",1,"Too much animated onesided storytelling.","I've started to watch with an open mind, but being a seaman and ex navy it's hard to 'not' notice the flaws in this movie. It is a onesided storytelling. First and and formost i hate the computer animation, it is so 'Disney-like', second it is obvious that the seaman and military character is not present in the actors, third, never throughout the war did a u-boat surface at those short distances at all, let alone to commence a surfacebattle with a destroyer, and last, it is not raw enough, that's what made 'Das Boot' such a great movie... Pity... i had great expectations for this movie."
"524","Greyhound",NA,"Gripping and poignant","This film maintains its intensity throughout. It is gripping, thrilling and touching. I got moved to tears in the end. I find this film very poignant."
"525","Greyhound",NA,"Zero character development","This is not a good movie. Imagine if you were watching part of a naval battle from nearby and could overhear the captain giving orders for the direction of the ship.That's the entire movie.You learn nothing about the main character All other characters do not speak outside of repeating the orders the captain gave them."
"526","Greyhound",1,"Let Me Save You From 90 Wasted Minutes Of Your Life","It's Tom Hanks on a boat, shooting at other boats. The entire movie. It is SO BORING!!"
"527","Greyhound",1,"Bland and empty","Lacking a back story for the main characters, any meaningful establishment of the broader WW2 situation, and being totally filled with fake looking CGI, Greyhound is a total dud.The entire film is one single battle that felt bland and empty. It lacks any depth what so ever. Thrown in is some commentary about the limited role African Americans played in the US navy that felt shallow and was dimly implemented. Tom Hanks does his Saving Private Ryan mark 2 performance, but it lacks anything new and certainly doesn't save this 'ship-wreck'.The CG looked so fake and is so over-used that I thought I was watching Polar Express a few times. With a budget this big they should have gone to sea and captured imagery that doesn't look like it came from a PS4 on steroids.The run time of the film is less than 90 minutes showing how little there is in terms of story. All there is is the battle, nothing more.You will probably get more emotion from watching a documentary.With the great cast and big budget the film makers could have made a memorable war epic about a critical aspect of WW2, but instead we have this uninteresting pile of rubble. Avoid."
"528","Greyhound",5,"Boring...","IMO it just didn't to turn out to be the movie they thought it was going to be. Acting was good, special effects were good but it was boring movie."
"529","Greyhound",5,"A Very Dull, Grey Hound","It's a bottled movie, shot on basically one green screen soundstage and later dollied up with digital waves and ships. For a war movie there is a surprising lack of blood and gore, which makes this an oddly toothless film. There is also a weird religious subtext that remains unexplored and doesn't add anything to the story. It's just there... much like Elizabeth Shue. She appears and disappears without adding interest or making an impact. It's not her fault, there is just nothing for her to do.There are some tense moments of naval cat and mouse but the overused CGI never allows the film to ever really build on that suspense.Hanks is dependable as always, but all by himself he can't keep this one from sinking."
"530","Greyhound",1,"Unbelievable","The biggest problem with this film was Tom Hanks.
He is a good actor but over rated and his performance here was terrible.
Mind you the screenplay (he wrote)was pretty thin and he did not have that much to do anyway.He kept asking for things from his cabin and I expected him to eventually be sitting in a bath chair smoking a pipe reading Kipling. Which would have been good for the crew as he was an idiot.Mind you not as stupid as the Germans whose tactics seemed to be surface next to the Greyhound in broad daylight and shoot it out.
At the end a British Captain after receiving Hanks report said 'unbelievable' and it was.The British Movie The Cruel Sea (1953) had a believable portrayal of the Atlantic War and the effect it had on those who kept watch and fought and died there. It was superbly acted and totally believable. Greyhound was a joke of a film. Not as bad as the laughable U571 but a joke all the same.Perhaps with a none star name and less money spent on explosions and more on an actual script and it might have been half decent."
"531","Greyhound",8,"Good, but lacked Epic-ness.","I really wanted more movie and less closing credits; in the 91 min runtime, almost 11 mins were closing credits, and the rest a constant minimal climax without any high points. Sure the runtime could've been sufficient, but Hanks needed a stronger script with more epic moments. Some of the scenes were too long, redundant, incomplete, or even unnecessary. Tbh, if Hanks didn't star in this one, it would've been a typical B-grade war flick. Directing was good, cinematography excellent and the score on point, especially the eerie orca sounds during the tense moments. An enjoyable, but easily forgotten film."
"532","Greyhound",2,"Monotonus and boring","This movie was very disappointing, I really wanted to like it. But it was monotonous with 99% of the movie on the fighter ship fighting with a fake sounding loud sound effects. Gave me a headache, take a couple of aspirins if planing to watch it."
"533","Greyhound",2,"Ridiculous Hollywood tripe.","If you have no understanding of the war in the Atlantic, then this movie is passable. If you want to watch it to get some historical context, do yourself a favour and avoid it. Fury on the high seas."
"534","Greyhound",10,"Stunning","REVIEW - GREYHOUNDApple TV exclusiveThere have been many film made about the war and living in the world we live in now it seems impossible that so many people lost their lives.The film follows a first time captain (Tom Banks) who leads a convoy ships across the Atlantic and follows him every step of the way from waking up to.........Slightly confusing at times when all of the course directions are being shouted out and I can't imagine how these captains did what they did to escort the convoy and protect them from enermy U Boats.Even though you at first do feel confused you soon realise the cat and mouse games being played between the sailors on the surface and those below.Stunning film, simply stunning and definitely one to watch first chance you get.Rating 10 out of 10"
"535","Greyhound",4,"Maybe it was all made on a video conference.","Cheesy graphics - The on screen graphics and CGI have the feel of a PC game.Basic sound track - as with the graphics, the loud repeating sounds are like a cheap PC game.Poor acting by the support cast. No craft in the production to build tension. Just bang bang bang.Hanks - out of place in a 'straight-to-DVD' cheapie."
"536","Greyhound",1,"Boring...",".. and doesn't come close to the other great navy war movies, it's a waste of time and only positive thing about this movie that it's short."
"537","Greyhound",5,"Short story","It is ok movie, but it is like a short story. There is no convincing character building, there is no back story. A the end you see it as ok short story that could be seen in 30 minutes and not 90 minutes."
"538","Greyhound",4,"Cheap filming quality","Felt more like a made-for-TV production instead of a feature motion picture."
"539","Greyhound",6,"Torpedoes but no Tension","The overall problem I have with Greyhound is it's lack of tension. Thrillers, especially war movies need to build the conditions of the plot to keep the audience engaged. The movie assumes the stakes of the plot from the second it starts. The lack of developing the circumstance of a ship being sunk suffers to motivate the viewer into really caring about the events that the characters will endure. This idea is also applicable to the characters: all are hardly developed leaving me underwhelmed in empathizing for them and wanting to root them on. Because the majority of the movie is filmed on a ship, there's little opportunity to get immersed in the setting. This element is especially frustrating for me due to how good this setting could of been. If the cinematography and directing was better, the Greyhound ship could of felt super claustrophobic, conveying a sense of no escape and little hopes of survival. I just never felt the full incentive to care about much of the movie's plot... this is not due to the lack of historical significance, but the lack of the film's ability to fully immerse me into the it's circumstances. Meh... go watch Dunkirk."
"540","Greyhound",NA,"The usual cut cost WW2 dreck we are fed now","Hazy CG battle scenes and now U-boats built like tanks as if if this was a battle of civil war iron clads, no the reality was U-boats were extremely fragile. Instead of taking the opportunity to demonstrate the drama of cat and mouse tactics, what we see is a cartoon. The 50 million budget must have gone towards the usual Hollywood accounting."
"541","Greyhound",2,"In German they call it ""Scheissdreck""","I never knew that the Germans have used submarines as ""Tanks on the water surface"" and fight Destroyers with the tiny machine gun. And so did noone in the whole world.One star for Mr. Hanks, and one star for the 17.5 Dolby surround roundandround noisy fuss 90% of time.Suggestion: Watch ""Das Boot"" for the real thing"
"542","Greyhound",4,"I wanted to love Greyhound, but it won't let me","The movie is technically just borderline ok. It's all studio filmed and therefore lacks authenticity of people being on a ship, at sea. It felt too much that I was on set watching the actors as the shots are almost always too close to give wider ""sea"" context. The CGI is PS4 quality. Soundtrack and sound effects are underwhelming.The dialogue is navy technical and sometimes you have no understanding of what they are expressing. 40% of the film is sailors repeating orders. The movie is certainly a golden gem for Navy veterans who understand what it's about.Zero character bond or development. Very difficult to be empathic/care for them. One sided movie with less than 1% German presence in the film.It's 90 minutes wasted, yet it feels like if it was longer, it could have been better developed.This movie is not worthy of being a major theatrical movie nor a premium Apple TV+ movie. A disappointment."
"543","Greyhound",1,"waste of time","A typical US movie boring would a German u-boat contact a us war ship ???
and all the rest again private ( hanks) movie not worth a second to watch ok maybe now with the virus nothing better on"
"544","Greyhound",5,"Disappointing","We really wanted to like this film but it is weak in many areas and sadly, Tom Hanks is partly the cause. He wrote the screenplay which is not very interesting. Compared with such films as The Cruel Sea and Das Boot, which covered the same scenarios, Greyhound was left in their shade.Worth a watch but don't get your hopes up."
"545","Greyhound",5,"Had Potential....","Decent battle scenes with a good cast. Could have been so much more. Weak storyline and character development. If there was more thought put into it, it could have been something special."
"546","Greyhound",5,"Dissapointing","The whole film is naval war and a ship called Greyhound fighting other attacking ships at sea. The backgroound music is annoying. All over the film. Didn't like it one bit."
"547","Greyhound",1,"My uncle had 2 navy cross ...","As a sub commander in world war 2, yet Hollywood keeps pumping this fictional story stuff out and drama without actually representing the people who served. Soo many stories they couldve used, and chose a 1:30 min chopped version of a fictional Captain to represent the Navy in WW2?? Garbage."
"548","Greyhound",3,"Disappointing performance and movie","This movie is only for the die-hard marine fans, as it all about a captain yelling coordinates to his staff to turn the ship from left to right or from right to left. Boring after a while"
"549","Greyhound",1,"Fell asleep in ten minutes...","Flat.Save yourself the time.You would think they would get most things right in this move but honestly from what I am seeing on revi"
"550","Greyhound",9,"Solid movie. It's a shame it didn't hit theaters.","If you liked Midway and Dunkirk, then you'll love Greyhound. This movie is a mix both of those movies in my opinion. The combat scenes were realistic and didn't have a bunch of unnecessary explosions and chaos. I was slightly disappointed that they lead everything up to the final battle, and then it wasn't very climactic compared to some of the combat scenes earlier on in the film - but again, it was VERY realistic. Not every movie has to end with a huge final battle filled with a TON of firey explosions and gunshots, especially since that's usually not how it happens in real life. 9/10 movie for me!!"
"551","Greyhound",10,"Outstanding Film!","This film is nonstop action. It takes you aboard a Fletcher class destroyer during a North Atlantic convoy escort early in the war. There is none of the human interests story like most of the War films that have been made. No unnecessary back stories or love stories. Just a small part at the beginning. It is all action. It will keep you watching if this is the kind of film you like. It is highly accurate and not missing a thing."
"552","Greyhound",5,"Typical and Boring","Stories tend to be just boring. the ending is predictable and typical American hero"
"553","Greyhound",1,"Horrible","This is not a moivie, it's a bad video game. :) Poor script, poor acting and very poor (or stupid) navy fights."
"554","Greyhound",3,"A Sinker","A pop-corn flick and more of these dumbed down war movies like we have seen in films like Fury that look amazing, pretends to be serious at least from the start, but ultimately offer nothing substantial and even resorts silly antics to entertain certain audiences. The supposedly scary Germans here are once against portrayed as stupid, inept adversaries (Star Wars syndrome) as their submarines who have the advantage of stealth and ambush, surface to engage and expose themselves to Allied destroyers, cruisers, ASW aircraft and engage in a naval battle in a manner not seen since the Napoleonic wars! I have not read the book but I doubt this is what the very technical C.S. Forester had in mind."
"555","Greyhound",9,"A true ""War"" movie","I see what the ""critics"" write about this movie, that it doesn't have ""character development"". Well, it wouldn't since it's about a battle in a war, now would it? And it's a damn good telling of a World War II battle. If you're looking for fluff, don't watch it. But if you want to get in the middle of a war, do not miss this movie."
"556","Greyhound",3,"Apparently Tom Hanks doesn't think he's famous enough","Tom Hanks wrote the screenplay. Tom hanks is a super huge star. One would think he wouldn't need more affirmation. Apparently not. As evidenced by three things:1. He wrote a movie with no other big star in it besides him. (I'm pretty sure Tom Hanks could scrounge up some big names to be co-stars.)2. Those of you who've seen it- can you name ONE scene in the movie without Tom Hanks in it? Think about it. ONE? Some individual shots, sure, but complete scenes?3. Can you remember any character besides his that isn't two-dimensional?I get that it's all about the character he plays. But you can do that without *having your face on the screen every damn second of the film*. Someone should write some code to go frame by frame doing facial recognition and check the ratio of frames with Tom's face in it vs any other faces (the special effect shots would automatically be weeded out since we're talking ratio of face frames only.)3 stars because the special effects were good."
"557","Greyhound",8,"Gripping","Really good. Based on C.S Forester's novel 'The Good Shepard'.It's not a long film so it's action packed, Hanks is his usual great self with great pose and action from him throughout. The character he plays has to deal with his faith as well as his role of a Naval Commander.Stephen Graham is his 2nd in command, apart from the not so good American accent, he performs fantastic in this.Don't get up at the end, watch the closing credits, these men from the Allies were ones to be proud of.Only things is it tells you on the Allies loses, could do with the fact that 9 out of the 10 German U boats were sunk, Shame that's not written at the end to show what the Allies did, a triumph."
"558","Greyhound",3,"Difficult to watch...","It's really badHanks acting is terrible - the CGI (which is the majority of the movie) is averageThe acting of all cast members is shocking - not one actor had any potentialAlso little things like talking really quietly when you ship is in the middle of a storm or wearing a jacket in a storm, but not one drop of rain lands on it annoyed meOne more thing, as others have mentioned, I don't think this story needed a movie...Worse than average"
"559","Greyhound",7,"Good fun but lacking bite","A good war movie, with excellent cgi and a great example of what they can do today to make a movie 'real'.But it lacks depth in the script to fully engage you, little character work outside the 2 main and little connection with anyone outside Hanks.Either way light but good fun."
"560","Greyhound",9,"Excellent Naval Warfare Movie!","Loved it! So refreshing to NOT have character development and tired storytelling tropes. Just great ships and men doing what they can to survive a terrifying situation. They could have taken the pre-war ""girlfriend"" scene out and added a little more ""destroyer crew life"" and it would have been even better, but I suppose people are critical enough of the lack of backgrounding. Yeah, there was a lot of CGI, but that's the deal with naval movies; without it they're just way too expensive to make. Solid 9 out of 10 from this ship fan!"
"561","Greyhound",8,"Good movie for service personnel","I enjoyed the movie, I don't think people who have not served will like it as much, but if your a veteran you will get it and enjoy it. Good movie"
"562","Greyhound",6,"Short but not sweet...","Short but not sweet, often chaotic and confusing, like the events they portray. More aptly called Greylamb as the 'Wolves' gather for the slaughter in the mid-Atlantic during WW2. A valiant attempt but doesn't quite achieve. Hard to be original with so many precedents."
"563","Greyhound",2,"Poorly writen C movie","Dull,boring with no meaningful plot or dialogs to speak off, Packed with below average cast, terrible scripting and GCI's. Left me wondering where was 50mln dollars spent. Tom,please stick to acting,writing is not your horse for sure. Unless, of course, you writing for modern state raised idiots that have no idea how to operate a door handle."
"564","Greyhound",2,"Yawn","40 minutes in and the same thing is happening. ""Left flank. Full rudder."" Yawn.
Hanks is great. Film rubbish. Switched it off after 40 minutes.
Don't waste your time."
"565","Greyhound",2,"Ridiculous and disrespectful","Tom Hanks is good as always and it looks good - BUT !!! what on earth were the U boat captains up to, how did they all set sail and leave the Dummy's guide to submarine warfare at home - if that is how a submarines are supposed to take on multiple heavily gunned destroyers its no wonder Germany lost WW2. So for me the film was spoilt totally, and the German U Boat commander taking on the role of a sub-aquatic Tokyo Rose i found disrespectful to Submarine commanders on both sides - Tom Hanks wrote the script it seems, and this is the epitome of him being so famous that others who read the script did not put him right on facts and history - if only he had watched Das Boot the film could have been so different"
"566","Greyhound",9,"Gripping, intense","This isn't a character driven movie, except for watching the slow exhaustion of the Captain. It IS a brilliant action movie - in the mode of Run Silent, Run Deep. It's short, 90 minutes, but those 90 minutes will raise your blood pressure. I loved it."
"567","Greyhound",2,"Cold wet men shouting numbers to each other","Cold wet men shouting numbers to each other - probably one of the most boring movies I've seen in years. Gosh it's boring. Really really boring."
"568","Greyhound",5,"Boring and cliched","Lack character development, depth and characters backstory to make some kind of bound between viewers and them but also between characters. It just feels like one naval battle, there is no room to see how the characters are changing, mature, how the war leaves its mark on them and so on. As a result you dont care about any of them. Lots of mediocre CGI. Lots of things that made me laugh and felt unrealistic, ubots like alot to emerge in close distance and even fight with 2 destroyers while beeing damaged and on the surface, german submarine commanders like to howl like wolves over radio etc. To sum it up it feels like CGI based short video. If you expect good marine/war tale and human drama you will be disappointed."
"569","Greyhound",3,"Disappointing","A Tom Hank's war movie sounded perfect. However, this is a poor effort and it was actually an effort to finish it. Apart from the boring, mundane plot there is very little character development or human interest going on.
The battle scenes are hopelessly unrealistic and there's a complete lack of tension and suspense throughout.
If you've ever seen Das Boot or The Cruel Sea you'll know what I'm talking out. Being stalked in the Atlantic by a wolf pack must have been terrifying, but Greyhound just doesn't get close to conveying this.
Moving on, the actual U Boat attacks were ludicrously bad, and this really hit Greyhound below the water line. While watching the hapless U Boats I genuinely wondered if the u boat crews were trying to get themselves sunk.
Over all very disappointing, this is best given a wide berth."
"570","Greyhound",8,"A chilling game of cat and mouse","Greyhound is another historic treasure starring Tom Hanks as US Navy Cmdr. Ernest Krause. His task in this latest WWII flick is to assist other allied naval vessels in seeing supply ships safely across the mine and submarine infested waters of the North Atlantic to Europe.Greyhound keeps the tension high by constantly reminding you of the unseen danger that not only surrounds them, but potentially lies ahead as they cross one of the most unforgiving bodies of water on earth at the height of the Second World War. What sets this film apart from most though, is that the lulls in action are as stressful than the bursts of combat they engage in. It's during the brief ceasefires that you realize what they're really up against and it's not just the German subs that literally taunt them from just beneath the surface.Krause's inexperience sees him fall for some of the decoys the Germans deploy, leaving his crew, the supply ships and the other allied escorts even more vulnerable. What starts out as a show of force retaliation becomes a shrewd showdown of wits using nothing more than instinct, skill and bluffing past their weaknesses. And in the midst of all this intensity, Greyhound
perfectly conveys the subtlety and power of what is unspoken in times of battle. It's the silent courage, the refusal to give up, and the modesty demonstrated while facing adversity. This personalization and humanity of the story is what will ensure this film becomes a classic.Overall, a great story about a rarely seen aspect of war that could have only scored higher by showing the perspectives from the other vessels who were a part of the same journey."
"571","Greyhound",5,"Just ok.","This was just an ok war film. Entertaining but the mistakes, for a military historian as myself, too away from it. Depth charges exploding and throwing up huge gouts of water (looks cool but doesn't happen unless the U-Boat is near the surface), the whole taunting bit was totally made up. And the Fletcher class destroyer wasn't in service yet. So, just ok."
"572","Greyhound",3,"Rather watch Das Boot instead!","This movie completely lacks of any emotional attachment to the characters. Therefore you don't really care who dies or which ship sinks. Despite Tom Hanks doing his most tormented faces I found myself rooting for the Germans in the end... just out of sheer boredom!I'd highly recommend watching Das Boot instead!"
"573","Greyhound",3,"Imptrresive CGI is not Enough","Special effects and CGI were very good as expected from a mega budget Hanks, if a bit cartoonish at times. The narrative though was pure Americana - from the captain's fanatical religiosity likely intended to appeal to fundamentalist evangelicals, to the melodramatic 'moments', deep lingering pregnant pauses, and Hank's irritatingly ponderous, morose demeanour.And then there was the inevitable American triumphalism and exceptionalism which is almost invariable overdone in just about every US war movie I've ever seen with the possible exception of Saving Private Ryan.Compare and contrast this rather spongy American melodrama with the electrifying Das Boot which encapsulated the utter horror of sea warfare. A masterpiece of a motion picture which grabbed you by the throat and never let go.."
"574","Greyhound",2,"Hauntingly bad","I am a Tom Hanks fan, but this movie is poor. There is no character development and some of the scenes feels random and should have been edited out. Don't waste your time. Apple please up your game..."
"575","Greyhound",8,"Very good movie for bridge communication presision","To the good bits I'm pretty sure anayone who served on a warship would say the communication and the way things are done on the bridge and other decks are on point best I've seen in a long time, the ackting from all was good to, everyone behaves differently under pressure and so it should be, obviously the movie uses a lot CGI luckily it looks ok toNow the bad parts a little more background story be nice it kinda jumped into the battle quickly sure we don't want a 3 hours long das boot movie. Also perhaps also what class of ship was the greyhound and other supporting ships names good but missing something"
"576","Greyhound",9,"Wauw lived it","I'm not a fan of war movies, BUT after Midway. This is my second favourite war movie. Great soundefects and music. Great shots, and most of all very scary. I was all the time like, go go go. Must see"
"577","Greyhound",8,"Thrilling. Although it was more of a reanimation of historical moment.","Thrilling. Although it was more of a reanimation of historical moment. Texts appearing often to give you information made it so, firmly. That's a minor inconvenience, however. I'm sure one can pass through that and just enjoy the thrilling war scenes and cool in-deck situations."
"578","Greyhound",5,"Is Greyhound a ""I love me"" movie for Tom Hanks?","Don't get me wrong, love the guy. He's a fantastic actor, collaborator, and producer. He has played iconic roles and is loved by all.I have three issues with Greyhound, and my 5 is a gift because it's a Hanks movie.1. The entire movie was about the captain. And guess who wrote the script?
Tom Hanks wrote the screenplay for Greyhound. I felt his character development of the Captain as wooden, shallow, and confusing. There was no witty or crisp dialogue. It was all about him, his suffering, and the decisions he had to make. Me. Me. Me. Me me me me. Me. Me and me. Sorry Tom, it's like you wrote the movie to glorify yourself in this role.2. It was too short.
The background intro was so meaningless I'm confused why it's even in the movie. He meets a 'girlfriend?' - some short dialogue, and then there are more flashback cutscenes from that meeting used that he actually had talking to her. And when it ended, at just over 80 minutes before intro and end credits, I was left confused as I felt there was a lot more to say about the movie for character development. He also had a good cast to draw upon for storytelling, and this movie had little.3. It was too much, too quick
Sometimes you need to go slow to go fast. I felt the movie went from 0 to Ending in the first 10 minutes - the interactions, action scenes, sequences, dialgue, didn't change much from, Captain has a target, chases target, some interactions with Captain with crew or other ships, target destroyed/escapes, Captain has some dilemma, Captain tries to eat, has sore feet, can't eat cause....Captain has a target, chases target etc etc etc and rinse and repeat.Should you watch this movie? Maybe. If you're REALLY bored. It's not a bad movie - and it felt more like a pilot for a proposed TV series than an actual Hollywood flick. Maybe that's the problem? Instead it wound up as a 91 minute ""We love Tom Hanks"" period drama and it seems narcissistic because he wrote the script as well and the entire movie was about... him. Mr. Hanks."
"579","Greyhound",5,"Not one to re-watch - like the 'oldies'","I like Tom Hanks. He's definitely one of the more realistic weather beaten believable actors out there. Without him the movie would have sunk like one of the merchant ships the convoys were protecting across the Atlantic.I'm a great fan of classic war films and there are very very few that cut the mustard nowadays when compared to those that were churned out in the fifties/ sixties. In particular : Run Silent Run Deep; The Enemy Below; Sink the Bismarck ; Torpedo Run & countless old British wartime adventures can be watched and re-watched time and again due to their storylines, multiple great character acting performances, intelligent scripts all wrapped up in an overall package that stands the test of time.Greyhound was better than some more recent films in that it didn't bombard you with ridiculous special effects & gung-ho but it just didn't grip you. I like a movie that gets straight into the business without wasted dialogue that makes no sense to man nor beast and I was pleased that Greyhound followed this course but I had no affinity with the characters whatsoever and the fact that it was the Captain's first seafaring trip across the Atlantic as lead convoy protector didn't come across as well as it might have.It's always welcoming to watch something new based on this era and it wasn't bad but.... they just 'don't make them like they used to'."
"580","Greyhound",2,"Pretty near the bottom of the apple barrel.","Really not sure where to start with this. Like the other recent offering Midway this movie is also on CGI overload. The quality of which is highly debatable. Certain scenes looked like Tom Hanks ( in a bizarre performance) had been super imposed on some X Box game. There is little or no character development and whenever you hear a British voice on a radio it sounds like someone putting on a silly voice. Thankfully this mess of a film has a short running time. It does serve as a reminder of how good Das Boot was. Not so much a Greyhound more a fat Labrador."
"581","Greyhound",10,"Better than expected by a nautical mile","Had very low expectations of this movie, and sure in parts it seems a bit pedestrian but overall its a 90 minute ride that will have you forgetting what the time is and make you forget you have a drink in your hand. I would certainly recommend and would happily watch again."
"582","Greyhound",1,"Video game rubbish","Forget it. Gung ho rubbish with ludicrous unrealistic tactics all round.
Watch 'The Cruel Sea' and 'Das Boot' if you want realism."
"583","Greyhound",1,"Boring movie","Not a good movie at all.. i was faster sleeping watching this movie.. anyways I watched it for Tom hanks"
"584","Greyhound",3,"Jim Lovell Meets WWII","Text: I've been looking forward to this movie. But unfortunately -1. It's convoluted. Hard to keep actions and consequences straight.2. Hanks seems too soft. Not sure if that was the point.3. Story seems to run in circles.4. CGI is muddy.5. Constant title descriptions are annoying.6. What's with the whale sound when showing the uboats?7. A few characters get killed off. We can barely care because they are undeveloped."
"585","Greyhound",2,"Why ???","So what to say........Another one bites the dust...
Hanks no Thanks......."
"586","Greyhound",5,"Could have been shortened to 30 minutes or...","...turned into a miniseries.I really wanted to like this movie; had high expectations for it as Hanks has proven to deliver excellent films on the WWII theme; however, it turned out that the trailers are much more interesting than the film itself. As many other reviewers have pointed out, the characters are completely empty, the dialog is composed of steering orders almost in entirety and if you remove introduction titles and closing credits, you're left with 80 minutes of finished film.You will also be left with a good amount of open questions to which the average viewer would have certainly appreciated even the most terse or cursory explanations.Last but not least, the ""enemy"" side is completely ignored, deformed and difamed. The German ubootmänner were valiant, brave and able men who laid their lives for their country, however wrong and atrocious their government may have been. Of all submariners who served on the German side, only 20% returned home; I think they would have deserved at least being treated in a respectful manner by the writers, but then that's Hollywood.A big ""F"" for Hanks, pity."
"587","Greyhound",9,"The Good Shepherd on screen","This is a great movie. Based on the novel ""The Good Shepherd"". It provides a realistic view of the battle of the Atlantic. The courage of the allied crews, the U-boat deadly threat, the agony of the Destroyer Captain. A must see for all naval officers, highly recommended for the war movies fans. If only it could last longer."
"588","Greyhound",6,"Unremarkable","Quite unremarkable. Probably the story itself is at fault, so I don't think someone could have done it much better. Do not want to diminish what those soldiers did, but maybe this story was not destined to be a good movie."
"589","Greyhound",9,"Very accurate","I thought this was a great movie. Not many movies have really captured what it was like for the sailors and soldiers to cross the Atlantic during WWII. I thought the battle scenes, basically the whole movie, was very accurate. I highly recommend it."
"590","Greyhound",3,"No it's not spr","Everyone knows Hanks is great actor, has a passion for ww2 and yes Saving Private Ryan is one of the best ww2 films ever madBUT this is nowhere near that..You just don't care about the characters. The cgi is crap..it'd look ok in a modern warfare game maybe..There is just a weird feel to this film..not to say we don't appreciate the efforts of everyone in the war but this film doesn't truly give any credit to those efforts"
"591","Greyhound",3,"Boring","I was really looking forward to this movie but regrettably found myself snoozing halfway through it. I love Tom Hanks which is what made this so disappointing. There is literally no character development. The story feels like it's missing a climax. The whole things feels incredibly monotonous. I gave some stars because the acting and cinematography was good but the story line is sorely lacking."
"592","Greyhound",5,"It didn't sink in!","This one stars Tom Hanks commanding a CGI-destroyer called 'Greyhound' in the Atlantic Ocean. He has couple of stand-offs with some CGI-german U-boats before returning home at the 1 hour and 20 minute mark. 5 minutes later: the endtitles.Like Nolan's 'Dunkirk' there's no character development at all. It's just 70 minutes of Hanks giving orders, and the second in command repeating them for the crew.I am surprised that I found 'Greyhound' boring, but now I can at least understand the reason for the straight-to-VOD decision."
"593","Greyhound",5,"Not great, very boring","Kind of a boring story to tell. Not worthy of a movie. It's basically reverse Das Boot. Whereas the U-Boat crew in Das Boot were underdogs in serious peril, the Greyhound crew is basically on a comfy theme park ride. The captain and crew got delicious meals in the middle of battle. Any Uboats trying to attack were dealt with with by serious, organized firepower. I couldn't tell one ship apart from another, there was no reason to care. Of course, the Greyhound had serious plot armor and you knew no torpedo would scratch the ship. The movie eventually just ends and that's that.Can't recommend."
"594","Greyhound",9,"Coulda shoulda woulda.... DID","I thoroughly enjoyed this movie,
Tom is one of greatest cinema's actors, except when he acts a politician :-).
It was from a novel, but that doesn't mean it wasn't from a 'true story'.
I love the actual light of the courage and you know what...
discipline .... military discipline.. only one 'f' bomb
and that came with an apology, I mean, so many movies highlight the ""undisciplined"" abusive language used as part and par of the military life.
I'm no military person but, foul-mouthing has become such annoying distraction to any and every movie.
Anyways, kudos to that aspect..... everything else, I repeat
I thoroughly enjoyed this movie,"
"595","Greyhound",9,"Some people like musicals...","This is a war movie following a US Navy destroyer shepherding a convoy of merchant ships crossing the Atlantic during WWII. As such, it is excellent and gives one a sense of being on the bridge of a warship as it traverses harms way. If you what singing and dancing or car crashes or sabotage or love triangles this is not your film. If you want what is probably a fairly accurate depiction of this narrow slice of combat then this is a movie you will enjoy."
"596","Greyhound",6,"Could Have Been So Much Better.","There was a lot to like about this movie. The battle scenes were tense, and the movie shows to great effect just how nerve wracking WWII naval combat was. It also was accurate for the most part, to naval protocol and procedure. However , Tom Hanks at age 64 is just too old for the part. Destroyer captains were likely mostly in their 30's in WWII. There was also just too much of ""Left Full Rudder"", or ""All ahead flank"", almost endlessly, for my liking. The part about the Germans using the radio to taunt the American sailors was ridiculous, so also the fact of having a submarine engage with destroyers on the surface. There is a reason they were called ""destroyers"". The movie did have naval advisors listed on the credits , so where were they on this ? I am being a bit generous with 6 stars here. Not one of Hanks' best, for sure."
"597","Greyhound",6,"I really thought I would love this movie more than I did.","First couple of minutes is exciting cause if it's action. Honestly, it's a repetition of Naval commands for the whole 1hr 30+ mins! Nothing else happened. If you're a Naval officer, you'll find this golden! But the appeal is not wide at all!The visual is AMAZING! Great! But other than that, there's not much else."
"598","Greyhound",2,"A very long boring naval battle","I was very disappointed by this movie, given the very good critics that it has received.
There is not much of a story, it is basically a single very very long naval battle. The film is too centered on the main character of Captain Kraus. Other characters are barely sketched.
In the end, watching the film was boring, and I ended up doing something else while the battle was moving at a snail pace."
"599","Greyhound",3,"A lot of action...nothing else.","Tom hanks as good as usual. This movie is basically all action and absolutely no character development. With better screenplay it could have been an excellent film...as it stands, it will be quickly forgotten...."
"600","Greyhound",6,"Intense but falls short","It's based on real life events, so I realize you can't really embellish it like an entirely fictional film. But you see some attempts at character-building, but in the end, no character really stands out or has any depth. Characters are just discarded--the wife (played by Elizabeth Shue for all of one scene and a flashback), the first officer, crew members, etc. It just becomes a series of naval combat action scenes. As many reviewers have commented, the movie feels like it's too short and missing something.There is a hint of something there--the frustration, dread, and the conflicting emotions of having to make difficult decisions of protecting a large convoy with limited resources. But Hanks plays a captain who supposedly is an inexperienced commander on his first command, having to face the full onslaught of an experienced German Wolf Pack--the problem is, he is so calm, collected, precise and intuitively makes all decisions correctly, it's not believable. Again, it's entirely feasible that the real life captain was exactly that and this was an extraordinary accomplishment, but as a movie, he just comes across as any commander with exceptional anti-submarine warfare experience, with none of the vulnerability, fear and doubt. The ""cat and mouse"" hunter vs. hunted tension that one would come to expect from a movie involving sub combat feels somewhat lacking.The action sequences are very good and seem realistic. But in the end, there's not a lot of substance, and you won't feel very emotionally invested in any of the characters, the way we've all felt watching movies like Saving Private Ryan, Das Boot, Fury, or any number of excellent WWII movies out there. It's certainly not a bad movie and enjoyable to watch, but understand that it's very limited in what it portrays."
"601","Palm Springs",9,"It's Very Hard to Dislike a Movie like Palm Springs","Films that revolve around characters repeating the same day over and over again has grown very tired in my mind. Groundhog Day perfected it and it really wasn't until more recently with Edge of Tomorrow that I really found a film that seemed to stand out among the rest. Well, I'm glad that I can now add Palm Springs to the list of films to put a clever spin on this concept. This film was originally supposed to play at more film festivals around the world and eventually receive a theatrical release, but things being the way they are, Hulu has now released it. Although this may be a film that's hard to find for some right now, here's why Palm Springs is one of the very best movies to come out of this bare year of 2020 so far.Nyles (Andy Samberg) and Sarah (Cristin Milioti) find themselves sort of bonding over the fact that they both really don't want to be at the wedding they're at. He's the date of someone who cheats on him and she is the sister of the bride, who clearly has many issues. Stumbling across a strange cave after the wedding, they both find themselves caught in a time loop that has them reliving the same day over and over again. Certain things are revealed about each of these characters that add a lot more depth to the story and I found myself incredibly engaged from beginning to end.Where this film shines the most is in the fact that it completely commits to the whole time loop concept, even giving a few winks at the audience. It never once makes any huge mistakes logically, which felt refreshing, especially in the ways it would subvert expectations and most importantly in the way that they choose to conclude the story. The way Palm Springs wraps up was a very entertaining and emotionally earned finale. Now, I feel like I say this about a lot of movies that focus so much of their time on very few characters, but I truly mean that if Samberg and Milioti didn't have any fun chemistry together, this film would've been a disaster. This is probably the most laid back and comfortable I've ever seen Andy Samberg be in a film and it made the entire experience that much better.Only having written and directed a few short films and a documentary before tackling Palm Springs, director Max Barbakow has honestly blown me away here. With a small budget, a small number of characters, and a small scope, this film felt much bigger than it was. I can honestly see a big future for him in the coming years. I will gladly seek out his next project. On top of his stellar work on this film, writer Andy Siara (who also doesn't have a huge filmography as of yet) added a very funny and clever tone to the whole concept. It was clear that the performers were very comfortable with the dialogue because their acting lept off the screen and that just seemed to be a nice mixture of everything coming together nicely behind the scenes.In the end, Palm Springs is a film that I was very much looking forward to, but was wary of due to the concept itself. Thankfully, this is one of the best movies that I've seen accomplish this concept in years. I'm not calling it a masterpiece by any means, but for a fun time loop movie, I really couldn't find many issues. At a mere 90 minutes, this movie flies by and has just enough clever surprises for those who may not have been completely engaged. While the idea itself has grown tired for me, this movie is undeniably hard to dislike. Everything about this movie put a huge smile on my face and if that isn't what the world needs right now, I don't know what is."
"602","Palm Springs",9,"Pure fun","Palm Springs is just such a good time of a movie, i was smiling for just about the entire runtime. Andy Samberg kills as always, and so did Cristin Milioti, they are both extremely likeable and have great chemistry together.I liked happy death day a lot, and I am very much not unhappy with the trend of Groundhog Day genre movies. This is now my favorite one. It's so inventive with it's story I couldn't predict what was gonna happen at nearly any point. So many clever twists to a story that could get tiresome quickly if not done right.Props for casting Connor O'Malley and Jenna Friedman in smaller parts, they both rule. #MinionSquadThis is a greatly enjoyable and fun movie, that I would recommend to just about anyone. Watch it"
"603","Palm Springs",8,"Weird but Good Weird","I was expecting a conventional rom-com where the guy meets the girl, but this one has a little twist. It's smart-funny, well written some of the shots are gorgeous and very wholesome. It's a fresh take for this type of ""genre""."
"604","Palm Springs",8,"Nice late night surprise","I was flipping through Hulu one night and saw this movie pop up, I saw it was Andy Sanberg and the cute chick from HIMYM, I thought hey maybe it'll be good for a chuckle, and if not, eh who cares. But it was a perfect late night gem, I love coming across movies or shows that I genuinely like by accident and with no expectations going in."
"605","Palm Springs",8,"Hilarious, you will not regret if you watch this movie!","A good thing about movie is that it doesn't last long, it has a story and a beautiful message. You will laugh, I promise."
"606","Palm Springs",8,"A New Take On Groundhog Day","Palm Springs is ""One of those infinite time-loop situations you might have heard about"". Palm Springs is a Rom-Com about Nyles (Andy Samberg) and Sarah (Cristin Milioti) two wedding guests stuck in a time-loop forced to relive the same day over and over again. Samberg and Milioti are great together as Nyles and Sarah. The CGI may not have been great, but that didn't take away from the many laughs I had during the movie. Palm Springs is a great movie, and if you haven't yet watched it, watch it."
"607","Palm Springs",8,"Absolutely Hilarious!","Palm Springs is a flat out hilarious comedy! The story itself has been done before and some have been great (Groundhog Day, Edge of Tomorrow, etc.) but Adam Samberg makes this one of the better ones. If you don't find this movie funny then something is wrong with you! Give it a chance and you will not be disappointed!"
"608","Palm Springs",9,"Hidden Gem!!","I really wasn't expecting a ton from this movie, I expected a pretty decent romantic comedy and I also love Andy so I was excited to give it a shot. But WOW was I very very pleasantly surprised!! I literally started it over immediately after finishing it cause I liked it so much. Completely not what I was expecting but I thoroughly enjoyed this movie. I laughed out loud multiple times, and the story is completely amazing in my opinion. Highly recommend if you're wanting a quirky comedy, but it also has very cute moments. LOVED it. I hope it gets the recognition it deserves."
"609","Palm Springs",6,"Pretty Good Rom-Com Time Loop Film","I'm a huge fan of time loop movies and this one might be in the top 5 of those I've seen.The first half is fun and enjoyable. Samberg and Milioti are great and work well together, and the use of multiple people experiencing the time loop - something that's surprisingly rare for time loop movies - works well. Samberg's usual over-the-top schtick is turned down to 25% here, which made the movie more enjoyable for me, as it meant the humour meshed well with the somewhat more serious vibe of the movie.Where the movie faltered for me was around half way through the movie where it switches from fun to drama. As with a lot of stories, this is when the world falls apart for our protagonist(s) and they need to fix things to get back on top and come out stronger than before. But here the resolution is not greatly satisfying, so it's not really worth the switch from fun. The ending itself is not the worst they could have gone with, but even that feels somewhat underwhelming. In fact, despite the movie having a somewhat unique premise, the last act of the movie feels like the generic final act that a lot of rom-coms movies use. I also didn't find Samberg's acting to be fantastic when he needed to act more serious, although that issue only stood out to me a few times in the film.Overall, though, the movie was good. It did something a little different with the time loop concept, the good parts of the movie were really enjoyable, and even if the second half wasn't fantastic it didn't ruin the entire film. So I'd recommend this to anyone who likes the sound of a semi-serious rom-com time loop flick. (And now that those 90 minutes have come and gone for me, I wish they'd actually made it an 8-10 episode miniseries instead.)"
"610","Palm Springs",3,"I Must've Watched a Different Movie than Everyone Else","I turned on Palm Springs last night since everyone is talking about it, and it has gotten rave reviews from both audiences and critics, which is kind of a rarity these days, and it also has Andy Samberg in it. It really sounds like it can't go wrong... but, it does.Throughout its run-time, I don't think I laughed even one time. Its trailer advertises it as a comedy, and everyone on here calls it hilarious, but seriously I didn't even laugh once. It starts off as almost like a sci-fi horror movie ala You're Next meets Happy Death Day, but after those first 15 minutes, it becomes to drab and mundane.I really don't think I've seen more people cry in a supposed comedy. Every 5 minutes someone is either crying or teary-eyed. And there is no comedy at all to be found. It's not darkly funny, it's not silly funny, it's just overall not funny. At all. But it's also not sad either.It's not a total waste because it is beautifully shot and well acted, but those are about the only two good things I can say about this. I just don't get it. Not sure what all the hype and ranting and raving is about."
"611","Palm Springs",10,"Honestly, I didn't expect to love it, but it's a classic.","This movie is utterly wonderful. It's heartfelt, romantic, real, and topical. It made me think, laugh, and cry.The Groundhog Day setup may seem stale, but they get so many fresh ideas out of the concept that it solidifies this film as a future cult classic.I was never really a Samberg fan. I am now!"
"612","Palm Springs",4,"Not Good Enough","Palm Springs was an okay movie. Script vice, the movie doesn't really offer anything new. The characters find themselves into a time loop and they just follow every classic rom com trop until the final ending. We don't get to know them, we don't get to understand them, or to understand the whole time loop concept really. The whole thing can be described as generic at best, with some odd touches here and there. The performances, in addition, were okay but nothing special. For all it's worth, it is not a waste of time, but nothing special either."
"613","Palm Springs",5,"Average.","Movie was okayish at best. Definitely not worth 9/10 rating people are giving it. Good for a one time watch."
"614","Palm Springs",9,"How to put an original spin on an unoriginal scenario","Im not gonna spoil anything or say anything else about the movie, if you've watched the trailer your just thinking to yourself ""oh another groundhog day"". This movie goes beyond what it is intended and leaves you laughing and feeling better than before you watched it. HIGHLY RECOMMENDED"
"615","Palm Springs",5,"Had potential but went too far with the cheesy rom com story","While Groundhog day was much more inspiring and transformational for it's main character, the characters in this movie seem to end more or less in the same place they started - being sarcastic and superficial. The first half of the movie was better, had some funny moments and interesting scenarios. But the 2nd half just turned into a very generic rom com and the end result was flat and uninspiring."
"616","Palm Springs",8,"Delightful, sweet, and charming","Ha! This movie is bold, sweet, and funny!I'm 65 years old and generally a prude when it comes to sex and violence. But this was a charmingly-delightful experience into a clever time-loop snafu, so I got over the cartoon sex and cartoon violence.Andy Samberg captures some of Bill Murray's frustration in Groundhog Day but then makes it charmingly his own. Andy is exhausted but then added into the mix is the captivating Cristin Milioti. And then things just take off in a bizarre way.The bar dance was mesmerizing and hilarious. Bonus points for the great J.K Simmons who stole every scene he was in. Bonus points for the amazing chemistry of Samberg and Milioti.I'll let the rest of the reviewers discuss direction, set design, editing, and cinematography - but all were perfect.In a normal year, this film would've garnered many academy award nominations. Maybe Best Picture would've gone to such a unique comedy. Who knows how the 2020 AA will shake out but this movie is just charming and delightful. Watch and enjoy! It's laugh-out-loud fun and just so sweet."
"617","Palm Springs",9,"Beautiful!","Thought I was not the rom com type, but this flick takes the cake. Such a refreshing and original premise and bombshell ending."
"618","Palm Springs",8,"Love it!","Gorgeous movie with a great premise, time loop movies are something that I will never get enough of! This movie certainly met my expectations. The twists were subtle and surprising which is hard to come by considering the fact that the same day kept happening over and over. All in all, a fun film!"
"619","Palm Springs",7,"A solid, innovative entry in the time-loop subgenre! [+73%]","Wow! This film was such a breath of fresh air. It's exactly the kind of film you need more of, during difficult times like these. The basic thread is borrowed from films such as Groundhog Day and Happy Death Day. However, thanks to the clever treatment of its core concept, the infectious chemistry between the leads Andy Samberg and Cristin Milioti, a solid supporting act from the ever-dependable J.K Simmons, and a brisk runtime of 90 minutes, Palm Springs is a winner all the way.Palm Springs will now be looked upon as one of the ingenious entries among films that deal with infinite time loops. More than being just a romantic comedy (which it is damn good at!), it also succeeds in putting forward relevant questions about life, relationships, routines, happy moments, and realizations. And most of them get answered too, within the film's context.Nyles (Samberg) and Sarah (Milioti) forge an unlikely connection on the latter's sister's wedding day. As Nyles and Sarah hook up, Roy (Simmons) shows up trying to murder Nyles and all 3 of them are drawn to a vortex that makes them relive the same day over and over. Palm Springs doesn't try to dig deep into the tedious scientific details of a time loop; writer Andy Siara and director Max Barbakow clearly know what they want to extract out of this idea.As a result, you get a rom-com that works well as a character study (Milioti is awesome; why don't we get to see her in more films?). Nyles has been in the loop longer and has grown to accept this repetition of events. Sarah, on the other hand, clearly was going through a lot (in terms of how she's perceived by her own family) and wants out of the loop. Roy is seen to be out occasionally seeking revenge against Nyles for bringing him into the loop. Do these characters attain closure the way they want? The film has some interesting tricks and laughs up its sleeve.Some of the humor stems from situations when the lead duo is trying to live it up while in time captivity but is not restricted to just that. Sarah is a well-written character as is Nyles, and the film benefits a lot from its quirky writing and energetic performances. Palm Springs is definitely a film that I'll watch again and I know I'll like it a lot more each time."
"620","Palm Springs",8,"A simple concept executed beautifully","The time loop shtick has been done a number of times but this new film takes it and puts a great romantic comedy spin on it. Andy Samberg and Cristin Milioti are great and their chemistry is off the walls. Watch it for a great time."
"621","Palm Springs",9,"WOW ! so much better than expected","This movie now is one of my favourite time loop movies.
Funny, hilarious, enjoyable and romantic. <U+2764><U+2764>
Do not think twice and watch it !!"
"622","Palm Springs",2,"Awful","Why all the buzz on this movie? Yes, it's a new and creative spin on the November 9 version of Groundhog Day, but it is nowhere near better. Except for some moments of JK, the repeat of nihilism day after day is not fun, nor is it entertaining. At least we weren't subjected to the first five minutes being played out each waking day.
I so wanted to like this. I so didn't."
"623","Palm Springs",4,"Weak sauce...","A weak-sauce rip-off of ""Groundhog Day"", but with particularly unlikable characters who never really show the growth that Bill Murray did in that 1993 classic. It is all so slight and insignificant. I chuckled twice."
"624","Palm Springs",7,"Enjoyable but no Groundhog Day","A good movie to watch if you want to kill a couple hours. The two leads are pleasant and I liked their chemistry but the movie was just not as well crafted as Groundhog Day which includes the attention to detail. Admittedly GD is one of my all time favorites so it's a high bar. The lead often doesn't act like a guy stuck in a loop for a long time. Also they didn't tell Roy what they discovered near the end which is a big loose end. They could have don't without the cheesy effects used to demonstrate traveling through dimensions or whatever."
"625","Palm Springs",9,"Really great!","Palm Springs works on just about every level. It has some genuinely funny moments, its heartwarming at times, and Andy Samberg/Cristin Milioti are fantastic and have great chemistry together. It's a romcom with a twist (which you should try to not know going into it) and it executes on its premise as effectively, if not moreso, as many other movies/TV shows with the same twist. Overall, I'd highly recommend this movie and would say that just about anyone can enjoy it."
"626","Palm Springs",7,"A lively time loop film.","* There is 1 mid-end credit scene *Max Barbakow in his feature directional debut and crew brought a lively time loop film. The story is about two strangers who meet at a wedding and they are stuck on a time loop. There are many genres with that concept, some of them are good and some of them aren't and this one was an interesting comedy-romantic version. It wasn't hilarious like I thought it would be but I still enjoyed it. The narrative was fun, odd and it all clicked fantastically. I loved the scene where the lead male character did a calculated dance at the wedding to impress her, sadly there weren't enough scenes like that. The ending felt cliché and it could have been better. They should have left it open to interpret and have the mid-end credit scene its only ending making an exciting interpretation.The composer Matthew Compton brought great music but I preferred he stuck with a pattern. His main music was basic in this kind of genre and it did fit with the film. He also had a few of them that were like in a synthwave tone and those were magnificent. How I wish the whole movie would have that same pattern instead of having a mixed one.The cast was fantastic, Andy Samberg's vibe was so electric and exhilarating. Cristin Milioti was more centered and loved her solo mission scene. Both of them had undeniable chemistry and never a dull moment."
"627","Palm Springs",3,"Samberg v Sandler","Call me an old fashioned bore, but they really suck at making movies these days. How on Earth is this a 84/100 on Metacritic is beyond me, even by their laughable standards. This is absolute pedestrian drivel. Out of the many recurring day themes in movies and TV (Groundhog Day, 50 First dates, Supernatural), this is definitely the worst. This made an 85 minute runtime seem unwatchable and never ending. Probably because Samberg is such a third rate version of Sandler, with none of likeability of the latter. Even my girl who can consume modern BS with more tolerance than me, was found fast forwarding this annoyance multiple times."
"628","Palm Springs",8,"Simply terrific","I'm impressed that people are still able to find new, original spins on the classic Groundhog Day premise of repeating the same day over and over. Palm Springs is a unique and compelling film that blends so many genres together into a dazzling package. It's slightly absurd at times, but that just adds to the charm of it. Andy Samberg is hilariously goofy and Cristin Milioti does a lot of the dramatic heavy lifting. This is just a really enjoyable, wonderful film that deserves to be seen and will undoubtedly make you happy."
"629","Palm Springs",7,"Very funny and amusing take on nothing you haven't seen before...","Very funny and amusing take on nothing you haven't seen before but re-dimensioned in a way that the films it copies will look a little less appealing next time it comes to replaying them - whether it be the past, present or future."
"630","Palm Springs",2,"Groundhog Day recycled again","Nothing new, nothing unique, nothing original, I have seen it so many times before. Not really funny, somewhat entertaining but gets boring pretty fast."
"631","Palm Springs",9,"A rom-com as one of 2020's best movies?! The refreshingly unique Palm Springs is here!","If you enjoy reading my Spoiler-Free reviews, please follow my blog :)If you've been following me for a while, you know I'm not the biggest fan of rom-coms. It's not that I don't like the genre (I appreciate and enjoy every single one), but I find its movies tremendously difficult to *really* love. The massive majority follow the genre's formulas and cliches to such an extent that I rarely end up truly loving one of these films. Some are way too cheesy. Others are way too unrealistic and dream-like. But the aspect that throws me off the most is the lack of originality. I can't remember the last rom-com I watched that didn't borrow from countless other installments. I didn't know a thing about Palm Springs: no trailers, no knowledge of critics/audience's opinion, nothing... And I'm extremely happy about that!I usually watch the main trailer for every film I review *after* I've seen the actual movie. I ignore all other trailers, clips, images, and so on. I do this so I can have some sort of knowledge regarding how far I can take my spoiler-free reviews. This way, I'm sure that I don't write about something I shouldn't. The official trailer for this film doesn't ruin the experience in any way, but it does tell its viewers the most relevant aspect of its screenplay. So, I could address it in this review, but I won't... because I enjoyed this movie a lot more, not knowing a thing about it than if I knew how it developed its story.Therefore, I'll keep it really vague, and just write that Andy Siara's first feature-film screenplay can easily snatch a couple of nominations when the awards season comes around. This is a rom-com like no other due to its refreshingly unique concept. It's true that it's not an entirely new method of storytelling. Many other movies also employ this idea, but Siara holds so many surprises within his narrative and so few of the genre's common traits that the whole film is elevated by his outstanding writing.It's one of the most entertaining movies of the year. With a short runtime and a fast pace, Palm Springs is constantly being genuinely fun, engaging, and even mysteriously intriguing. Its original plot makes the viewer think and remember previous lines that take a whole different meaning a few minutes later. There are no predictably dumb narrative decisions, and its characters escape the cheesy and forced relationships that these films usually insert them in. The dialogues are hilariously captivating. Almost every single plot point packs an emotional punch, a jaw-dropping revelation that never crossed the viewer's mind.Andy Samberg and Cristin Milioti share such great chemistry. Their characters are exceptionally developed, and their relationship feels incredibly real. I'm rarely that viewer who requires the main characters to be together, kiss, fall in love, and all that, but Nyles and Sarah are two wonderful protagonists I can definitely root for. Both carry an interesting ""baggage"", which is also explored at a deep level. They deal very differently with the ""situation"" that the story puts them in, and it's so much fun to watch them go through it and evolve as characters. Oh, and J.K. Simmons (Roy)... this man doesn't know how not to be utterly remarkable!Max Barbakow (directorial debut) demonstrates his talents as well, by allowing Siara's screenplay to shine under impeccable direction. Tonally, it never loses its balance. It keeps its comedy pretty grounded, considering the craziness of its premise. It never relies on the genre's formulas, cliches, and cheesy outcomes. It really separates itself from the majority of modern rom-coms. I don't really have any flaws to point out... The ending does have a ""just accept it"" narrative component, and there are a couple of unnecessary scenes, but I'm nitpicking here.I can't believe I'm going to write this, but Palm Springs is not only one of the best rom-coms I've ever seen, but it's also one of the best (if not *the* best) movies of 2020, so far. With the help of their first-time director (Max Barbakow), Andy Samberg and Cristin Milioti spread their extraordinary chemistry all over the innovative, original narrative, written by the also debutant, Andy Siara. The latter is undoubtedly the main responsible for such an entertaining film. Siara takes an imaginative concept and develops it in the most captivating, fun, hilarious, and even intriguing way possible. A surprising screenplay packed with emotionally impactful plot points, revelations, and twists that keep the enjoyment levels extremely high. The two protagonists are exceptionally developed, as well as their compelling relationship. With a fast pace and a perfect balance of its tone, Palm Springs sets itself apart from the other movies of the genre, staying away from all of the cliches, formulas, and stereotypes associated with it. J.K. Simmons also lends his awesomeness because why not? Whether you're a fan of rom-coms or not, I definitely suggest giving this one a look. You won't be disappointed!Rating: A"
"632","Palm Springs",9,"A Beautiful Movie Indeed","After watching the trailer, I thought it'll be the same time travelling thing again like GroundHog Day or any other time loop movies but this was much more.Even the feels and how I felt that it's more than a venue but a comfort zone and what do you do with it.By the end, I was smiling so wide due to everything that happened and what the characters represented."
"633","Palm Springs",9,"Surprisingly Pretty Good","If you watch this with an open mind, no knowledge of what it's about and no expectations, it's refreshingly surprising and heartwarming. Much needed distraction from all the nonsense that is going on in the world. Some parts are a bit inappropriate, but what else would you expect from Andy?! Give it a try!"
"634","Palm Springs",10,"A very funny and smart take of Groundhog day","If you are not familiar; with the concept; basically a person keeps living the same day again and again until finding a way to get out of the loop.
Basically is that happens to Sarah (an outstanding and lovable Cristin Milioti) when by accident gets trapped in the same time loop with Nyles (Adam Samberg ) and Roy (J.K. Simmons).
The movie portraits three depressed, frustrated and immature in funny and sweet way making really care for the lot.
Giving too much will be to spoil the surprise; but let's just say that the movie is able to be sweet, entertaining but with a very deep message about what we make of our lives and understand for happiness.
In brief; it is really worth seeing it."
"635","Palm Springs",7,"Enormous and exhilarating fun","While the basic thread is borrowed from films such as 'Groundhog Day' (Harold Ramis, 1993) and the recent 'Happy Death Day' (Christopher Landon, 2017), 'Palm Springs' benefits from the clever treatment of its core concept, the quirky writings, energetic and infectious chemistry between Andy Samberg and Cristin Milioti, a solid supporting act from J.K. Simmons, and a brisk runtime of 90 minutes. Enormous and exhilarating fun."
"636","Palm Springs",7,"A breath of fresh air","Palm Springs is the typical romantic comedy meets Groundhog Day. The trailer is very indicative of the tone and style of the movie. Yet it is not overtly explicit and leaves out some nice surprises.It is hard not to love this movie. Not only because it is funny but also because it is sweet. The movie operates on a Groundhog Day(GD), time-loop, premise. Andy Samberg relives the same day over and over. Then, things become complicated when Cristin Milioti is dragged with him to live on the same day forever.It is interesting that GD has become the canon of time-loop movies. Not that it is a bad movie, but it feels very quaint. It works more as a modern day fairytale than anything. And it revolves entirely on Bill Murray and on his own desires and impulses. Bill Murray breaks the spell when he grows out of being a jerk. Obviously it is a movie from another decade, but you can see the same mechanics in Edge of Tomorrow.Palm Springs starts almost where GD ends. Andy Samberg has already mastered the world and himself too, to a certain extent. He starts with the nihilistic hedonistic worldview. This leads me to consider actually Milioti as the protagonist. This movie is GD from a woman's perspective. But not in a hacky Oceans Eight way.
It takes the absurdity seriously, and builds on it to deliver a powerful story. I loved that the first thing she does is trying to get out of the situation. And later on her whole character arc is not dependent on the actions of someone else, but it her willpower to fix the situation herself. Her arc is that she actually does get out of the time-loop. It is refreshing to see that dynamic in these types of movies.Of course, for all the movie's psychological and meta-physical themes it does stay firmly in the rom-com genre, with a light emphasis on comedy. The topics of the purpose of life are secondary to the tropes: they meet, they fight, they go back together after having learned something. Yet, I don't necessarily hate that . It makes for a charming movie. My only complaint is that there is not enough JK Simmons. He ends up having a smaller role than the trailer suggested. But it is not all that bad, in return the movie focuses on the romance between the two leads.And I think that is the charm of the movie. It is smart, but it is not heavy. The story is character driven but it also allows for gags and funny setups. It is similar to Love Wedding Repeat, premise-wise. However, it left me with an even better feeling, which might be result of a more focused story, more out-loud comedic tone and some of the greatest comedy actors. Not that they had bad actors, but hey were mostly unknown and British. Here Samberg and Milioti carry the movie to the highest levels."
"637","Palm Springs",8,"Groundhog Day and Friends","It's like I said, I love ""Groundhog Day"" (1993). I've seen it over a hundred times.... But, I enjoy time-travel movies in general, including the time-loop variety in the vein of that Bill Murray-Harold Ramis classic, such as ""Edge of Tomorrow"" (2014) and Netflix's ""Russian Doll"" series. Time travel is an inherently cinematic notion, of an art form that literally consists of moments in time--still images, shots and scenes--along a continuum--what used to be the film strip--that may be edited, rearranged and begun again, reviewed by the spectator ad infinitum. The main difference of ""Palm Springs,"" although it's partially a continuation of a thread from ""Russian Doll,"" is that it places multiple characters in the time loop instead of just the usual lone (and usually male) protagonist--to wake up in the same place on the same day every day, always at a wedding in Palm Springs. Thus, there are shifts in perspective running concurrent with the temporal repetition of events and place. Besides offering a greater gender balance to the rom-com formula, this opens up an array of possibilities in montage and storytelling.In this case, the bifurcated narrative is largely exploited for efficiency. I'd be fine lingering in such a scenario, a sense Murray gives us in ""Groundhog Day,"" with his various schemes and explorations of his situation. It's a fantasy that's well suited to the episodic format of ""Russian Doll."" Unlike these prior efforts, however, ""Palm Springs"" rushes through and is able to do so because Andy Samberg's Nyles has been living this repeated plot for long before we caught up with him in the movie, and so he is able to quickly get Cristin Milioti's Sarah up to speed when she joins him in the repetition. Interestingly, the idea of beginning the picture with the male character having already re-lived the same day untold times was a feature of Danny Rubin's original screenplay for ""Groundhog Day,"" but Ramis altered this rather arthouse notion to an easier and more commercially-friendly beginning where we enter the time loop at the same moment with Murray. ""Palm Springs"" is able to have it both ways.Neither does ""Palm Spring"" afford much space to philosophical or religious musings. Indeed, Nyles declares on the first night we meet him that there's no god. Even the supposed quantum physics within the picture doesn't rise above the sophistication of an installment from the Marvel Cinematic Universe. Ultimately, ""Palm Springs"" is merely a place we're meant to inhabit fleetingly, for some laughs and the cliché love story conquering all. Some critics are surely tempted to analogize this version with the unraveling of habit and structure making days seemingly run into each other--losing track of time--for many in the real world of 2020 by isolating themselves or otherwise limiting their activities due to the pandemic, but the timing here is as accidental as that for the characters within the movie. No, ""Palm Springs"" is a lovely fantasy, where death is a reset button and where one feels more freedom than ever without the threat of tomorrow, as well as to experience it safely with others. There's no meaning underlying this romp beyond the hackneyed wholesomeness of family life provided by J.K. Simmons's Roy and romantic coupling that's the foundation of the entire premise. That's fine; fun need not always be wrapped in layers of existential profundity--a ""shaggy dog"" story will do. Some days are well enough by just enjoying the slight variations to the same format. I'll see ""Palm Springs"" again."
"638","Palm Springs",8,"It is worth a watch","This is not a movie that will change the world, but it was a very pleasant diversion. It has some great performances and a watchable, if not recognizable, plot line. It was a very nice way to kill part of a morning."
"639","Palm Springs",8,"Groundhog Springs","I'll be honest, I've been getting a little burned out on the resurgence of the ""Groundhog Day"" style movies. It's not that they're all bad, I've actually enjoyed a few of them but there's been such an influx of them lately I'm just... Not super into it. That said, really enjoy Samberg and the Lonely Island guys and Brooklyn 99, so I was a bit conflicted on this one.Absolutely surprised me with how good it was. It plays with hilarious comedy and moving somber notes so well throughout. It embraces and challenges the ""Groundhog Day"" theme wonderfully. Samberg even plays a more toned down character and it's still exceptional. Oh, and J.K. Simmons? Even more wonderful than usual.For me, the only down note is Cristin Milioti. I didn't feel like she struck the right balance with her character. With Samberg playing more reserved, I would have loved for her to be the crazy one or maybe even the super nice one, something to work with Samberg's performance and instead I feel like she lands right in the middle and... She's not bad but doesn't quite shine either. There's a possibility that she's just not for me though, because I didn't love her in How I Met Your Mother either.They were also clearly on a weird budget because some of the locations look pretty fancy, but the few special effects looked dreadful to me. I don't expect blockbuster effects from a movie like this but we've been doing CGI fire for a while now and I feel like it should be possible to make that look half-decent on a budget. Still, that's a small thing.This is an absolute recommend for me. This was a lot of fun and even my negatives aren't a huge detractor here. Throw in the fact that it's streaming right now on Hulu and this is a readily available movie that everyone should check out."
"640","Palm Springs",9,"The only Groundhog Day reboot","Great twist on the OG Groundhog. The chemistry between the 2 is real. The range of the acting and witty humor makes it a refreshing watch. Grinned for most of the movie."
"641","Palm Springs",8,"Very enjoyable rom-com with a little twist","While it's not ground-breaking or revolutionnary by any means, Palm Springs provides a fun and heart-warming viewing experience.It's not perfect, the resolution and the ending feel a little bit rushed in my opinion and certain plot points remain a bit of a mystery (especially how Andy Samberg's character ended up in this situation in the first place) but overall, I do not regret spending one hour and a half watching this movie. 7,5/10"
"642","Palm Springs",7,"7.0 A very clever rom-com.","I planned to watch Gladiator tonight but I honestly couldn't be bothered as it's around 3 hours and quite heavy. So I remembered that Andy Samberg had a new film out so I thought I'd watch it for the ""How I met your mother"" , Judd Appatow feel I was looking for. I watched it and was pleasantly surprised at how clever what could've been a very simple rom-com turned out to be."
"643","Palm Springs",7,"Good sci-fi romance","Good fun entertaining. It is almost impossible to make a good movie with an happy ending. Disney spoiled happy ending for the most of us."
"644","Palm Springs",7,"i didn't love it but it's still a very good film, with relateable characters.","Now this is a pretty fine film, that came in a time where movie audiences want to watch something good - mostly because there isn't as many offer as it's usual in a regular year. i haven't seen more than 3 or 4 movies from this year, this one is the best so far, from my very little sample.Samberg and Milioti have a very good chemistry that definitely carries this and it makes a very watchable piece. samberg isn't far from his usual, even though he's more contrived here. the characters go through a journey of self acceptance and caring, through a time-loop. there's a lot of dialogue concerning nihilism and how far they have to go until they start to actually care.now i'm a fan of time loop movies. everytime i see there's one i want to check it. groundhog day is probably still the best, but here they do a creative approach to this.with the editing for example that i think it was smart. or on the different stages they positioned the characters at the beggining. there are a few variations from the theme that actually work here.the script makes two likeable leads and creates a good pace too. i'm not a big fan of two things: first i think this could have been funnier. it has some nice jokes, but i think it could have been a bit more tailored. the style...well i like the music and the editing, but i don't find the cinematography or the colours very attractive. there are some parts where this definitely wants to make an ""indie vibe"" and i didn't feel it.it is still a fun watch and an emotional journey. the pace is also cool, never gets boring. i understand also why some people loved this. i don't think it's a great film, but it's a very nice one, that is engaging, interesting and has heroes we actually care for."
"645","Palm Springs",7,"Not a bad watch!","Though it was better when it was called Groundhog Day, it still was a decent movie! That said, it's a
""one-time only"" viewing. Modernized version of the Bill Murray classic, but mirror image on the premise."
"646","Palm Springs",7,"Immortality, yea or nay?","New twist on living each day over again. Made me think ""Would I really want to be immortal?"" I really liked this movie. It's all about the mood your in. Just go with the flow and enjoy. Peace."
"647","Palm Springs",9,"They did it!","Somebody finally reinvented Groundhog Day. I sat through Edge of Tomorrow, Love, Wedcing, and Repeat and Before I Fall only to realize it was for the Lonely Island to master. Milotti and Samberg play off another beautifully while the amazing JK Simmons is great as usual. Also this screenplay was ridiculously clever."
"648","Palm Springs",7,"Pleasantly predictable movie based on ""Groundhog Day"" formula","As many of us have been stuck in quarantine over the past three months, reliving the same boring day over and over, ""Palm Springs"" couldn't come at a better time. What makes film work is that it's a blend of the familiar and the new. Basically, movie is just another ""Groundhog Day"", but tonally, the comedy here is much more in line with a more Millennial, crass brand of humor than the Boomer-produced ""Groundhog Day"". At the end, ""Palm Springs"" is entertaining enough no mater there are some slower moments, but they won't really bother you. For me, it wasn't the best time loop movie ever made, but my wife and I did enjoy it on a lazy afternoon during 2020 pandemic.Rating: 7"
"649","Palm Springs",8,"Perfectly Captured","What will happen if two wedding guests get stuck inside a time loop?! Hulu's Palm Springs delivers that answer perfectly in it's beautifully written and thoroughly engaging rom com that shows you how endless the possibilities can be along with the powerful performance from both the actors and the director."
"650","Palm Springs",9,"Ending movies like this is problematic...","I kept waiting for this movie to shyte the bed, and it just refused. I REALLY enjoyed this ride.As I neared the end, I was almost anxious wondering how they were going to wrap it all up.
I realized immediately that ending a movie like this was always going to be problematic, but they did a good job, and it did not take away from an otherwise great experience.I watch movies with the intention of laughing, crying, and laugh-crying, and this movie delivered on all counts.A final quick note, I absolutely love Groundhog Day-ish movies, but so rarely are they done well. This one delivered."
"651","Palm Springs",8,"Very enjoyable!","Surprisingly good! May even watch again. Samburg is hilarious, the leads chemistry is good, and the movie was altogether engaging and heart-felt. Ending was a little lackluster, but I still came away from the movie with a smile on my face."
"652","Palm Springs",8,"Stop, Repeat and Rinse! Repeat Again!","For a time looping movie, Palm Springs came out tops! Fun, funny, smart and a fresh take on the tired worn out start your day over and over again concept.Some very decent writing, acting and directing takes this film to a high level that lately many other films fail to reach.A must watch - a good laugh and an ending that works!This film scores a very well deserved looping 8 out of 10."
"653","Palm Springs",8,"Totally made me LOL a few times!","Cute story. Obviously, like 95% of the movies, you already know what's going to happen and how it's going to end. It's the journey that matters and all the jokes along the way. This movie made me seriously laugh out loud a few times at least (which doesn't happen that often these days) and I really enjoyed watching these two characters go through the story. Definitely recommend this but if you are going into this expecting something new or a masterpiece then... well, you need help."
"654","Palm Springs",9,"A happy little accident","I watched this because I love Andy Samberg, and I genuinely thought it would be a mindless rom com that was must meh, but boy was I wrong! This is such a fun modern day take on the Groundhog Day, time warp plot. I was actually on the edge of the couch most of the movie. Full of laughs, plot twists and genuine moments. So glad I found this gem."
"655","Palm Springs",9,"Well acted and charming, excellent take on Groundhog Day","Andy Samburg is hilarious in this movie and shows his acting chops, I think Bill Murray would be proud. Christin Milioti really helps to bring an original take on an idea that has been done over and over again. JK Simmons is always a welcome addition to a movie. I'd watch it again tomorrow."
"656","Palm Springs",7,"Better Than Expected","I honestly thought this would be just another Groundhog Day ripoff, but it ended up being considerably more. The acting was well done, the casting was on point, and it was funnier than I had even hoped it would be. Very happy I decided to see it."
"657","Palm Springs",7,"Nice shot","Time loop has always been a recurrent theme on movies but few times has a movie about the topic achieved this amount of entertainment and fun. Simple but entertaining movie. This is another proof that imagination is better than big budgets. This movie is about having a good time watching it and it delivers. One of those little gems we find from time to time."
"658","Palm Springs",8,"Pleasantly enjoyable.","Pleasantly enjoyable comedy movie. It was so casual. I liked it. Just lay back and let the drama flow. Oh, one crucial thing though; Do not get serious at this one tiny science part. That's a comedy too, in a big way. You should know that by now. I mean, didn't we watch this movie for eons? 'Woaaaaaht? (lol)'"
"659","Palm Springs",6,"Fun but uninspired","The two lead performers and their chemistry elevate this take on the Groundhog Day formula even though the story leaves plenty to be desired. There are some funny gags but the overwhelming sense was that I had already seen this movie. You get all of the standard rom-com beats plus a retread of every joke in Groundhog Day. It is a nice movie overall and there is nothing expressly bad or offensive about it (besides one groan inducing ""science"" montage), it just isn't very new or innovative."
"660","Palm Springs",1,"I am with the negative reviews.. this was just...","... terrible. Obviously the total rip-off Groundhog Day. Just adding another person to the time loop doesn't make it different enough to make it good.Plus, the acting was so atrocious. Everything was so over the top and forced trying to be funny. Can actors just act like they mean it? The lead actress was beyond bad.Then they had the extremely lazy exposition of how everything ""works."" I have so many questions to why it made no sense. He hates his wife, but he still wants to have sex with her?I could go on and on.Skip this..."
"661","Palm Springs",8,"A refreshing take!","We do get a lot of these time loop movies now a days but trust me, this one does have a unique approach.I was actually really surprised with this one. Great chemistry/performances from both Andy Sandberg and Cristin Millotti, plus its always good seeing J.K. Simmons whenever he shows up in a movie. Funny dialog and does keep things engaging throughout. It is not an average RomCom and rewards those who are giving their full attention. The pacing does slow down a little bit compared to the first act but still keeps things pretty interesting. Dont let it slide under your radar and check it out!
My actual rating is an 8.2/10"
"662","Palm Springs",10,"What would you do if you lived the same day over and over again?","Answer is: Most people already do. You wake up in the morning, go to a job, get back home, hang out with your family, maybe do something in between and go to sleep.
Living one day over and over is one movie concept that gets used every once in a while, and usually those movies are very enjoyable to watch. Why? It's a mix of ""how are they going to get out of this"", character development and finding new ways to enjoy life. Palm Springs is similar to Groundhog Day because of the repeating days concept, but they don't have much else in common. If you like movies like About Time, Groundhog Day or even Edge Of Tomorrow, this is a movie for you. It is really a great combination of romance, comedy and sci-fi and if you like a good laugh and a good romantic story, I would definitely recommend it. Really well done by Hulu, everything from acting to directing was done professionally and superbly. Netflix/Hulu movies have not been famous so far for their cinematic/entertainment quality so I was really surprised by Palm Springs."
"663","Palm Springs",7,"An incredibly fun and original film.","""Palm Springs"" is incredibly original, thoroughly inventive and the feel-good movie we need right now.
.
In this comedy, two strangers who meet at a Palm Springs wedding, get stuck in a time loop.
.
The script is fun and sharp and the performances from Andy Samberg and Cristin Milioti are really great. The duo has a quirky chemistry that is almost impossible to resist. The film itself is seriously irresistible; if you don't have a good time watching ""Palm Springs"" maybe get yourself checked. The use of the premise and the time loop are done with precision that even if certain scenes are contradictive, it still feels refreshing to see these characters go through what they're going through. I really enjoyed this film.

"664","Palm Springs",9,"Heartfelt and quirky time loop movie.","This movie was a fun and intriguing watch that was able to pull you in from the start. I've loved many of Andy Sambergs previous works, as well as Cristin Milioti, and the chemistry between them was undeniable.There were many things I loved such as the 80s themed music, beautiful cinematography, sarcastic comments between Samberg and Milioti, as well as the tender moments between the leads and the supporting cast. While this movie was great I did find certain scenes didn't flow as well, and there were a couple plot points that were easy to figure out early on, but I think those things are able to be overlooked with this type of movie.Overall, if you have Hulu (or even a drive in nearby that might be showing it) I highly recommend it. It has laughs, a likeable cast, and is a well done movie that should be watched during a year when movies have almost ceased to exist."
"665","Palm Springs",9,"The less you know about this movie the better.","Yes, it's an indie rom-com, which is the worse combo of genres imaginable. But with ingenuity, humor, sincerity & as many surprises as a clip show of Shyamalan endings, Palm Springs should be the sleeper of the summer. With Samberg & Milioti soaring, it's an honest look at a relationship from every side, what it looks like when people grow apart, and is it worth ending a relationship for the promise of comfort. A beautiful capsule of what marriage should be."
"666","Palm Springs",4,"Over the top positive reviews does not make a film great.","Let me just say that this movie was ok at best. But it is no where a 7.5 rating film. It's a 5 at best. There was nothing outstanding about the story, the cast or the climax. The over the top positive reviews are nothing but possible Samberg groupees flooding IMBD with delusions of grandeur fake reviews. The best time loop film of all times is and always will be Groundhog Day. And let me just add, not to give the only African American any lines in the scenes (except for about three words) he was in is just the absolute worst."
"667","Palm Springs",9,"I have nothing but respect for this movie","Pure fun, good times and really happy kinda movie."
"668","Palm Springs",6,"This film should have stopped at 40 minutes.","This is a six...barely. The start of the film is actually pretty good and you 'd think that this will get funnier and funnier but halfway through it gets closer to romance than comedy and loses it's pace. Also, for Andy's style, this is not a raunchy film. Acting is ok, storyline is cool...but for about 40 minutes. Then the script changes tone and becomes a neo-melo-dramatic hipster-esque conversational piece. 6/10"
"669","Palm Springs",7,"7.5 Well worth watching, just once","This film could have been much better, like possibly an 8.5 or 9 film if it was just longer and funnier. Throughout the entire film I laughed twice, so it's certainly not a 'laugh-a-minute' type film. The plot/story is a good one, and not one that I've EVER seen done before, which is great, since you see the same plot/story used OVER and OVER again so often, but this film's plot is truly original.Samberg and Cristin Milioti deliver good performances. The film is a little short though... I would have loved it if the film was about 20-30minutes longer, so that some time could be spent on showing the various 'loops' that the main characters have previously experienced. With a plot/story like this, you could have SO MUCH fun, with the various crazy and wacky things that the characters could be shown doing (like robbing a bank, jumping into a volcano, wrestling a bear, etc.) but alas this film's short runtime leaves very little time for such antics, and thus results in only a 7.5 film."
"670","Palm Springs",5,"You wouldn't watch it again","This was an ok movie
An ok movie to spend time if you are watching it for the first time !
it is a groundhog day in a different perspective, you could and would watch groundhog day anytime again but not this movie !
good enough to enjoy but not good enough to watch again !"
"671","Palm Springs",9,"Incredible for a Hulu film","I've long decried the quality of streaming-only platform films, which are usually high budget but low quality. The ""expensive mistakes"" bought up by streaming services from big studios desperate for any new content, or made by the streaming studio itself.This movie is not those movies. I really enjoyed this film!
It was entertaining throughout, I cared about the main characters, I dug it.I actually watched it two times, I haven't said that about a film in ages, let alone a Hulu film.It has minor, forgivable flaws. I'd probably normally rate it 7-8 / 10, but compared to what's out there right now in the film world? This is a solid 9 all the way."
"672","Palm Springs",10,"finally","Finally a true successor to Groundhog Day! Cristin Milioti gives the breakout performance she has been waiting for. Script is wry and sly and continually engaging. Also the best romcom in years."
"673","Palm Springs",10,"I can't believe they actually made a romantic comedy that's (completely) different from any other ever made!","That's it. I don't think there is a better complement to give here, is insane. They've managed to re shaped, and tell such a refreshing story, in a genre that can be so repetitive most of times. Don't get me wrong, some of my favorite movies of all time are rom-coms, but this is different from everything I have ever seen. A movie doesn't need to be completely different from everything that came before in order to be great, but when they are, it feels... fulfilling (if that makes sense).If you've seen the trailer for the movie, you know what the movie is about. Basically, two people, getting to know each other, in ridiculously stupid situations while stuck in a time loop (actually, it would be at least interesting the experience of seen this movie without any previous knowledge, just thinking is a regular romantic comedy).And well, they delivered, Andy Samberg is my man, I love the guy, I love Brooklyn 9-9, and I've been closely watching almost everything he does for the past few years, and he rocks, always funny, a great comedian and actor. Cristin Milioti is also great here, some of my biggest laughs in the film were on her scenes (like the first scene in the desert, when Nyles gets shot and she goes ""wtf?! wtf!?"", is so genuine! J.K. Simmons, is also here, he isn't in the movie that much, but when he is, he's great, as always.Anyway, to sum up, the movie is great, is refreshing, is so damn funny, the story is great, the dialogue is great, the direction, everything about it is great. Sure, you could point out that their ""way out"" isn't that believable, but c'mon, they've earned cause of how innovative, and smart the whole storyline of the movie is. So, that's it, Palm Springs is an amazingly funny rom-com that takes place in a time loop, and that's a phrase I never thought I would say, but I'm glad I'm saying now.Before I forget: One other good thing I thought about it, is that I thought cause I already knew about the time loop thing, that the first third of the movie or something would be useless, and boring, but it wasn't! They go almost instantaneously straight to the point, and the story moves fast (after all, the movie has just 90 minutes)."
"674","Palm Springs",9,"Weird. Goofy. So funny and entertaining","Such a fun and entertaining movie. Great chemistry between Andy and Cristin. I highly recommend. This was a much needed movie in these crazy times."
"675","Palm Springs",9,"The Cinamatic Manifestation of 2020","Palm Springs Micro Review -When Palm Springs premiered in January at the Sundance Film Festival it never could have predicted it would be the cinematic manifestation of the year 2020. While the film is built upon traditional romcom scaffolding its characters and their balancing of hilarious moments with honest and authentic underlying feelings of loneliness elevates the genre. Palm Springs is near perfect at accomplishing what it set out to be.Andy Samberg (Nyles) has been stuck in a repeating wedding day time loop for an eternity, when by chance, Cristin Milioti (Sarah) becomes unknowingly trapped with him. Samberg uses his comedic background as a well executed shield for Nyle's nihilism for the situation he has found himself in. Miloti faces her own challenges and plays off of Samberg's quirkiness acceptance of this bizarre situation fantastically. But Samberg and Milioti's back and forth is more than well executed hilarious moments, they punch upwards towards exploring our interconnections.While I did not care for ""how"" the time loop was addressed, Palm Springs is not a film about escaping a never ending repeating day. Palm Springs authentically addresses the feelings of loneliness in a world we sometimes feel we have no control over with leviety. One of the best films 0f 2020."
"676","Palm Springs",10,"Loving it","Great movie. Funny and creative. Great acting though"
"677","Palm Springs",9,"Palm Springs - Movie Review","Palm Springs isn't the best film of 2020 so far, but it's one of the most purely entertaining experiences I have had in quite some time.It's labelled as a comedy, but one of my problems with the film is that it's not as consistently funny as I would have liked. There are some humorous moments, and most of them land, but there weren't as many gut-busters as a film like this could have done with.However, this didn't bother me too much because it was replaced with deep, complex questions, and a narrative that was far too clever than a film like this had any right to be.The script was sharp, and the characters were fleshed-out. Andy Samberg, Cristin Milioti, and J.K. Simmons were fantastic in their roles, and the film is carried on their shoulders and the predicaments they find themselves in.The pacing wasn't the strongest, which is a little concerning for a film which clocks in at less than 90 minutes, but there was a section in the middle which I could have done without. There was some nice development of the Roy character, but I still felt like everything else ground to a halt for a while.Fortunately, the film picked up again and the last act was incredible exciting. It challenges the audience with complex questions, whilst being entertaining and powerful at the same time.Although we have seen films using time-loop elements before, including classics such as Groundhog Day, I still felt like Palm Springs was an original take on this formula and it gets a strong recommendation from me.SCORE: 90%"
"678","Palm Springs",9,"Cute rom com that is a lot of fun with the lovable cast.","Palm Springs (4.5 out of 5 stars)Palm Springs is a lot of fun romantic comedy film that delivers a Groundhog Day like scenario with a romantic comedy twist. The plot follows Nyles (Adam Samberg) who is stuck in a time loop, reliving the same wedding day over and over. Stuck with an unfaitful girlfriend. Sarah (Cristin Millioti) who is living with regret and follows Nyles and gets stuck in a time loop with him. They both try to make a time of there lives.Fun plot. The movie does turn a lot of fun when Nyles and Sarah try to make most of it with there repetitive time. Like having fun and doing things differently. Having like a 1980s retro dance in a bar. Interrupting there girlfriends hook up. Ect. The film does leave you smiling and has a few laughs. Which does get a little few in between throughout.Adam Samberg is great with the role. Cristin Millioti is also perfect with the role. The music score was decent. Trying to be like a 1980s score. Yes, its a romantic comedy that does have a predictable ending. But it is a lot of fun throughout that makes the movie worth watching."
"679","Palm Springs",8,"Thank you for making 2020 less sucky.","Palm Springs is great romantic comedy that answers what if? A movie that is worth repeating."
"680","Palm Springs",9,"Thoroughly enjoyed it","A nice surprise. Had some great laughs, with heart and despair thrown in for good measure. Was just a really nice balance you don't often see in movies these days. Recommend watching it if you get the chance"
"681","Palm Springs",7,"A nice comedy about a person who is stuck in a day","This is the story of a boy who is stuck in a day. I remember the first movie that I watched with this kind of story was Groundhog Day 1993. I like these movies since they show us how valuable is each day of our life. We grow up we have kids. Our kids grow up. You see time is passing and so many good things come with it. I liked the innovative story of this movie. The movie is filmed in different locations like a wedding venue, a desert, and a bar. Andy Samberg and Cristin Milioti played well in this movie. I liked the special effects. I enjoyed the music during watching this movie. In summary, I recommend watching this movie to comedy fans especially fans of multi-verse and time loops."
"682","Palm Springs",8,"A really great and unique rom com!","So, Palm Springs is the recent production of Hulu with Nyles (Andy Samberg) and Sarah (Christin Milioti) stuck in a time loop living the same day over and over again. From the first few scenes you can understand what this movie really is, it's a funny realistic view on what would happend if this situation was possible by physics. I am not the kind of person who would discuss the science behind a fantasy comedy so I am pretty cool to accept that this thing is happening and I am trying to focus on other things, and after that this movie works really great. It's not only the fun cool view on a situation like that, what people would do if they lived the same day again and again, it also has pretty good character development throught its short duration, nice and funny stuff and actually works in a weird unique way. It's definetely not your average rom com but works perfectly as that, there is chemistry, great acting, fresh story for the genre and everything brought together for the viewer to have a great and relaxing time. It's not the life-changing lesson and the romance doesn't work perfectly but it's a truly great rom com trying to be what it is, a believable view in a ridiculous and improbable situation. You should definetely check this movie out cause it will be a guaranteed fun time."
"683","Palm Springs",8,"Way better than I thought it would be","Novel twist on the same old story with a love interest thrown in. Well done, well written, loved JK Simmon's character. Not what I was expecting at all."
"684","Palm Springs",8,"Quirky and Charming","For a film that rips its premise off the ultimate time loop movie, ""Groundhog Day,"" ""Palm Springs"" is surprisingly unpredictable and exceedingly charming. It's got an anarchic anything goes vibe and a pair of vibrant actors, Andy Samberg and Cristin Milioti, who also happen to have a ton of chemistry together. It's a movie for our very troubled times and seems tailor made for a quarantined audience, where day bleeds into day and the repetition of the weekly grind is sending many of us to the loony bin. The sweet message at the center of this otherwise naughty film is that it's not the what we do that keeps us happy but rather the who we do it with. It's all about appreciating the little things that make life worth living moment to moment rather than focusing all of our energies on the big things that we chase at the risk of letting peace and contentment pass us right on by.This message is most effectively encapsulated in the character played by J.K. Simmons, who spends the first half of the movie trying to kill Andy Samberg and then has a great scene toward the end that makes the most mundane situation imaginable seem like a little piece of heaven. How I can relate to that right now.....Grade: A-"
"685","Palm Springs",10,"Watch this movie!","I have never left a movie review. This movie made me feel so many emotions. Andy Samberg is so talented that it felt like really watching someone fall in love. I am so happy about the character arc that ""Sarah"" was given. I think that even though the living the day over again concept is played out, but this story gave it an interesting spin, and a solution. I am so happy I watched this."
"686","Palm Springs",8,"Quantum physics at its best?!","What a fun movie about quantum physics! I had fun watching this movie and enjoyed every minute of it. It combines Groundhog Day, Happy Death Day but it's still unique...a fun love story!"
"687","Palm Springs",9,"One of the few best rom com.","I dont like and tend to watch rom-com movies, but i ended up enjoying it so much, bought joy to my heart. Christin milioti is great. Definitely should be on your watch list"
"688","Palm Springs",8,"Pretty Damn Good","Modern take on Groundhog day. That's how i'd describe this film to anyone that initially asks what it's about. The story is very different and the decision to ground it (Slightly) in some science was cool.All in all... it was a fun flick that I'd recommend."
"689","Palm Springs",10,"Amazing","Amazing movie, very well-written and smart. What elsa can I say, watch it."
"690","Palm Springs",8,"Smooth and funny...","Just shows you that millions don't need to be spend to make a good movie.
This movie has that amazing feel about it where you wished you were in the movie itself. Definitely one of the best movies of the year."
"691","Palm Springs",8,"Great Dark RomCom!","Cristin Milioti makes this movie! A great heroine, imperfect, flawed and perfect at the same time! I've always been an Andy Samberg fan and this quirky Groundhog Day on crack is a good fit for his quirky personality. I like the couple's chemistry and J.K. Simmons is perfectly cast, too, as the protagonist. The ending kind of surprised me as I expected credits before the very last pool scene. A cliffhanger ending would have suited this movie with the shaky science perfectly. That's the only reason I gave it an 8. It was a great escape for 1.5 hours."
"692","Palm Springs",8,"Much better than anticipated","I'm thankful to everyone for saying this was surprisingly good, because I don't think I would have given it a shot otherwise.Maybe the Groundhog Day formula will always be entertaining, because I'm yet to see a movie use the premise in a truly bad way (I'm sure there exist examples though).
It's good enough that you almost wish it was longer, but I guess the 90-minute run time does help keep the movie fast and entertaining and never boring.I'm not sure it would exist without Groundhog Day, but it does a decent enough job at combining the premise with the genre of romantic comedy, leading to something that feels fresh enough.And it's just hugely entertaining to boot. If you sometimes have problems paying 100% attention to a movie you're watching at home (hate to admit it but that's me sometimes), then give this one a shot because it is super engaging.
If we don't count Hamilton as a proper ""movie"" (apparently the Oscars aren't going to, as a sidenote), then I'd say Palm Springs is probably the best release of the year so far."
"693","Palm Springs",7,"Good movie; bad title","Fun mashup of the time loop rom com Groundhog Day and the more sophisticated time loop sitcom Russian Doll. But the title is so wrong - this movie was neither shot in nor bears any resemblance to the actual desert city of Palm Springs, which features stunning architecture and really nice hotels. This looks like it was made in some ratchet desert area near Joshua Tree. It's like if Woody Allen had shot the movie Manhattan in the Bronx and kept the title."
"694","Palm Springs",6,"Today's Version of Groundhog Day","I'm a big fan of both Cristin Milioti & Andy Samberg to start with so this was an easy choice for me to watch... While I enjoyed the film, it just felt like I was watching a rehashed version of Groundhog Day.The chemistry between the two leads was good and it certainly had its funny moments along with great side characters especially in Roy (J.K. Simmons).I just couldn't help but compare it to Groundhog Day. I wouldn't buy it on DVD/BRay but if it was TV I'd probably watch it again."
"695","Palm Springs",8,"Groundbreaking? no. Hilarious? YES.","I didn't go in to this movie with much expectation other than knowing I enjoy The cast.It's got some plot holes but overall is a great laugh."
"696","Palm Springs",9,"Craziest Entertainment","This one is imaginative ,creative,fun, romantic and craziest entertainment.Brilliant screenplay from andysiara and assured direction from maxbarbakow.what a making ,tiny budget movie ,a lots of fun and excitementSparkling hilarious chemistry between andysamberg &Cristinmilioti ,they ruled,special mention to merdithhagner and JK Simmons is perfect.Overall palmsprings is amusement to enjoy at home"
"697","Palm Springs",10,"A future cult classic","I have this feeling that this movie will be very adored by cinephiles (now and) in the future. You can really feel the heart that they puto into this."
"698","Palm Springs",9,"Smiled the entire time","What a refreshing, sweet, hilarious heartwarming movie. Absolutely loved it! Andy is so great and shows some range ans depth. Absolutely will watch multiple times"
"699","Palm Springs",8,"Very enjoyable and thinkable sci-fi","The first thing come to my mind when I watched this movie is that ""Groundhog Day"" (1993) time lopping where Bill Murray's character got stuck in. But in here there's a way of going further with the idea of being inmortal. Discovering the meaning of life through days gone by is a get off well technical goosebump, followed by a bunch of unnecessary time-travel resolutions we don't need to. Same as ""Back In the Future"" (1985) when Doc tries to explain what is going on a blackboard. Of course this is a reference. The last thing I have to say is the exploitation of Simons' character as a man who is tired of living his life but at least has to raised? two little childs cause of one Mai Thai left condom. The relationship between Nyles and Roy could be the same Alan Parrish and Van Pelt in ""Jumanji"" (1995). Just because we don't know what happened between the last two. It came randomly to my mind but I think it's another cinematic reference so filling more scenes with them. And you? How many did you find?The positive ""vibe"" is somehow on the dialogue comes from Sarah when she asks Nyles: ""Well, then what's the point of living?"". Or Roy's best meta quote: ""At least you have each other. Nothing worse than going through this s**t alone"" referring to life itself. It's a comedy but it take it seriously to the frame"
"700","Palm Springs",8,"Exciting, funny , good directions.... perfect...","First of all,, camila mendez is hot.. beautiful lady.. i wished she could do the lead character... but she wasnt..anyhow .. christine did very good job.. well performed movie..Even its low budget movie. 5 million $ .. most AAA movies cost start from 50+ million $. still its well written , performed and directed."
"701","The Rental",5,"Could have been great...","I really wanted to love the hell out of 'The Rental'. The trailer looked great. The cast (particularly Dan Stevens and Alison Brie) sold me. The fact that Dave Franco was making his feature film debut as screenwriter and director intrigued me. I was cheerleading for this movie to be a good, if not great.But this movie was, unfortunately, only a 'watch once/mixed bag' kind of flick. It's the plot of almost any low-budget ""Home Invasion"" or voyeuristic horror movie made in the last 10 years but with a slightly prettier package. Netflix's 'The Open House', 'Afraid', 'Ratter', 'Hangman', '13 Cameras', '14 Cameras'... if you've seen any of those movies, then know what to expect with TR.I cannot fault Dave Franco's solid directing, the cinematography and good cast performances - it was great to see Alison Brie return to the horror genre since her appearance in 'Scream 4' and Dan Stevens is always a treat. But unfortunately, the storyline for The Rental is just too bland and predictable to make a real mark. I expected more suspense and something a little more memorable than something that can sit in a crowd of similar titles and still be seen as derivative and unremarkable. I also didn't have the best time with these characters; too much relationship drama and not enough build-up of suspense.I'd have given this a 4/10, but I'll give it an extra star because of the cast, direction, and good production values of the movie overall. Still, a ""rental"" at best.5/10."
"702","The Rental",5,"This was pointless.","A generic, pointless and anticlimactic movie that fizzle out into nothingness.
It always amazes me when people get a shot at making a full length movie (in this case, Dave Franco) and when they don't have anything new or good to bring to the table. Then why even bother?
A waste of money, time and talent (Stevens and Brie.)"
"703","The Rental",5,"Vacancy meets The Strangers","I wanted to like the movie, but sadly it's been done before and better with the movies in my title. That said the cast is great, I think Dan Stevens is one of the best actors around.So In my opinion it just doesn't do anything new and the ending was also poor, let's hope Mr Franco can come back with something a little more original next time."
"704","The Rental",7,"Not bad","Way better than the ratings. It keeps the intrigue for the first part and the rest has a good rhythm. Pretty decent directing by Franco. I don't see it lower than at least a 6. It is one of the lowest ratings compared to the quality of the film I have seen in my whole life."
"705","The Rental",6,"Decent little thriller with third act problems.","Two brothers and their significant others spend a weekend in a beautiful beachfront villa. What could possibly go wrong?Dave Franco does a decent job for a first time director. The Movie is beautifully shot, atmospheric and moody as all hell. The cast is awesome, I always enjoy Dan Stevens and he's a delight here, but so is everyone else. I almost loved this movie but sadly the whole thing falls apart in the third act. Its as if a tense thriller is interrupted by a slasher film and its as abrupt and awkward as it sounds. That said the movie does not go where you expect it to and it is shocking and surprising."
"706","The Rental",4,"Dave Franco tries too many new things for the first time.","The Rental is a new horror thriller directed, written and produced by Dave Franco. This is the first film he has directed and he is more known as an actor in the film world.In the film, brothers Charlie (Dan Stevens) and Josh (Jeremy Allen White) decide to go on a weekend trip with their friends. They have found a perfect house online by the sea and are trying to make it a pleasant weekend. They only suspect that their landlord is somewhat racist towards Josh his Muslim girlfriend Mina (Sheila Vand). Despite this mistrust, the four try to make it a fun weekend, but during this time together they get to know each other better than they expected. This is how their mutual relationships are tested. When Charlie discovers they've been secretly filmed all weekend, he must choose to find the hidden footage or confess what he secretly did over the weekend.Dave Franco has portrayed this film as his first directed film, but he has also taken on a bit too much hay by partly writing and producing this film. By taking on all these different tasks, he still struggles to convey the film clearly. At one point, the movie almost comes across as a long episode of Temptation Island and turns more into a teen drama than a horror thriller. This aspect comes to the fore without further explanation. Due to these unclear and sudden changes of genre, the film can come across as tedious.The acting comes across as nice, but due to the unclear script, the cast doesn't really have many chances to make something special out of their roles. The characters initially come across as adults with work, but later the characters behave more like teenagers."
"707","The Rental",5,"Tense & uncomfortable... but definitely not scary","Whilst this is a decent effort for a directional debut with a constant feeling of tension and uncomfortability, the R18+ rating and horror genre classification seems misplaced.There's a real longing for a decent new horror film, and this isn't it.If you've seen every other horror film and have nothing better to do with time to kill, then give this film a watch... but if you don't get a chance to watch it, you're not really missing anything great."
"708","The Rental",8,"People's expectations are waaaayyy too high","I've seen a lot of IFC films and if there's one thing consistent among every release it's that they specialize in the unique, and this film is no exception.What is sadly not surprising is the audience reviews here that seem to completely miss the point of a movie like this. A problem I see on the outset is that the film is billed as a horror but is more of a slow burn dark thriller, similar to that of The Gift or The Invitation or Come To Daddy, such that I generally know where it's headed but the journey contains enough unforeseen events to make the trip worthwhile.User criticisms of the third act aren't valid, in my opinion. People seem to think that if a story isn't spoonfed to them then it makes no sense or is sub par, but the opposite is usually true. In this film, the tension of the characters comes to a head and chaos ensues when what's supposed to be a fun getaway for an average group of friends turns creepy and violent after multiple betrayals of trust occur. The scary part is the ending because it touches on the unnerving reality that there are some very sick people out there in the world that take advantage of the trust we hand over to strangers, a naivete that most of us don't grow out of until later on in life, sometimes never. The very last shot during the credits is the scariest, it reminded me of the ending to Creep.The only aspect I feel is lacking is the score. I feel the composers needed to work on bringing a bit more excitement to some scenes that clearly called for it, but instead i felt the soundtrack was too slow. I don't feel the composers were trying to capture the mood of the characters at all and instead were going for scary at all times.I give it a B+, a relatively short but unique thriller that's worth the watch."
"709","The Rental",2,"What a waste of talent!","Don't waste your money on this terrible clunker! What a waste of talent because the cast is top notch. The script is subpar and the story ridiculous. It was beyond amateurish.So sorry Lip, Trudy and Matthew. Wink!"
"710","The Rental",1,"Please Don't watch this crap !","It's a complete waste of money. All this above 4 stars (those are paid promotions). Very very bad and cliche story. Too many holes and too much nonsense."
"711","The Rental",1,"Not horror, zero tension. Zero stars.","Two couples, cabin, weird land lord, cheating, death and no explanation, the end. Do not watch, anyone positive about this piece of feces is brain dead. Avoid like the plague!"
"712","The Rental",4,"I would not call this movie a horror movie! because it's not horror!","The movie is very slow events, the characters aren't that interesting, normal people with drama, it has a drama all the way, fighting, and mysteries, but I wouldn't say I was not interested to know what behind the door, with the code which is locked but moving on, at first, they were going in some far place to have some holiday or relaxing or whatever, not sure why they go to far place that no service there, or anything, it's like they want bad things to happen to them, anyway, I wouldn't spoil the end of the movie but many things which are not natural on the story and atmosphere here, well at the end it's a good movie to waste your time end, it wouldn't last a day or two remember this, as it's not going to hang in your memory for much of time."
"713","The Rental",1,"Boring and cringe","I made it halfway through the movie and gave up from it being super boring and cliché. Foreshadowing cheating couples.. really?.. The hot tub scene was super cringe. I expected more from one of the Francos. You are a normie Dave."
"714","The Rental",1,"Cliche!!!!! Predictable!!!!","We've all been there before, seen that before, copied that from any D grade horror script.
Gawd, if your going to do something, do it good, or don't do it................"
"715","The Rental",6,"A splendid directorial debut!!","It's about a group of four friends who decide to spend their weekend in a rented mansion, oblivious to the chaos that follows. The plot was a bit slow placed, nothing really petrifying or eerie takes place into the first 30 minutes of the film. Mediocre acting by the cast which was subdued by an intriguing plot. Well, I expected a lot from Dave Franco and he could have done better. The ending however was startling. brownie points for that! In nutshell, it's an enjoyable one time watch, so show some love and support for Davey y'all as it was a great attempt at making a thriller!"
"716","The Rental",6,"If only characters were likable","What makes a movie good is a nice plot that grabs audience. What makes it even better is if the characters were people we would root for. None of the characters are likable. Their antics and behaviours leave little for audiences to cling to...so seeing them killed off seems almost desirable."
"717","The Rental",2,"Just not good...","I was actually rooting for the bad guy. The characters, minus the wife, were so horrible that I honestly could not have cared less if they died. I love James Franco, but this was so terrible."
"718","The Rental",1,"Sloooooow","I've had more fun watching water boil. I can not believe anyone thinks people want to wait an hour for anything to happen in a movie. Why even bother making it? One if the worst movies I've seen at the theater. Not worth a watch for any reason,"
"719","The Rental",6,"Pretty good","It's pretty good. It's very slow. Some interesting character drama in here. There's a little twist at the end. Nothing very scary, but nice tense atmosphere at times. It's fine, no problem if you watch it! It's pretty good."
"720","The Rental",3,"Boring.","It really annoys me when people get drunk in these movies and drink in spas and pools.So dangerous.This movie could've been much better.The people in the story were not aware of their surroundings and were annoying.I switched off .Not my kind of movie."
"721","The Rental",8,"A suspenseful and realistic horror/thriller!","Overall I thought it was great! It was gripping, the storyline was solid and atmosphere was on point the whole way through. Would definitely recommend if you liked The Strangers and You're Next."
"722","The Rental",1,"That's definitely the worst 1.5 hrs of my lift that I've ever spent.","OK so I was digging it, until the ending. That was the worst ending that I've ever seen that I can remember of & I have seen a lot of movies. I think Dave Franco do not understand the meaning of the word ""Why"". Why did the killer killed everyone why, there is no answer. I am sitting here like I could have watched absolutely anything but not this. Anyone reading please do not waste Ur time. Everyone's time is valuable. This movie is just a complete facade. Dave Franco just don't do this. I have never felt so strongly about any movie before then this one."
"723","The Rental",10,"What? This is a great crime movie!","I don't understand the negativity here. This is a great crime movie. One that could even lead to series 2. The monotone and yet intense mood, that's very hard to portrait via screen but they managed to do it here. Not many crime movies or horror movies can do that these days. Perhaps low rating is because they watched this movie during day light? Classic inexperienced mistake."
"724","The Rental",2,"Absurd","I don't even know what I just watched. A bunch of stupid people do stupid stuff for stupid reasons and nothing makes even a little bit of sense.
Just save yourselves the trouble and literally watch anything else."
"725","The Rental",1,"Waste of time","Dave Franco should stick to stupid dude bro movies"
"726","The Rental",1,"You Have Already Seen This","In fact, you've seen it several times - in various ways and aspects.
How many horror movies have you seen where the first 2 acts are fairly decent and then suddenly it all falls apart for the third act?How many movies have you seen where there's a build-up of tension between the main characters then suddenly the director realized 'Oh, we need to actually make something happen' - so a series of killings is shoehorned in... without any back story, without any rhyme or reason?How many movies have done the voyeurism angle and you think 'Well maybe they won't mess it up this time' - but then they do?There's nothing new here. You will watch this and not come away with any new experience unless you've never seen a movie in this genre before."
"727","The Rental",7,"Good enough to want a sequel","Even though the film is a long way from being perfect, I think it can defenitly open a modern slasher franchise, with great and uniqe storytelling for this ganre. I'm really intrested in what Franco can further do with this concept. Dear Dave, if u see this - please, I want a sequel!"
"728","The Rental",2,"sooo frustrating to watch","Nothing made any sense, all the conversations seemed pointless and lacked depth and-or witt. They mostly just fought over weird stuff that didn't add any development to the plot (if there was one) or the characters.No resoulutions or consequenses to any of the issues they create/encounter throughout the movie.
They created dilemmas, but no epiphanies... They just kinda ended the movie lolGood actors wins an extra star."
"729","The Rental",4,"Not sure what happened?","This movie could have been good. But. Then there was no plot and no ending. Just a bunch of starters that you want to follow through, but end up leading nowhere.
After watching it, I still cannot answer those questions?: who's the killer? Why is he/she doing this? What's gonna happen next? Why are the characters all imbeciles? I just don't know what this movie was about?
A bit disappointing."
"730","The Rental",1,"Unoriginal and tries too hard.","""The Rental"" tries too hard to be something it's not and let me tell you, it's not a great effort.In this horror film, two couples on an oceanside getaway grow suspicious that the host of their rental house may be spying on them.Co-writer and director Dave Franco attempts his hand at being a filmmaker in this somewhat horror, maybe a thriller flick, and I felt absolutely nothing throughout. The four characters are one more annoying than the other and the overall ""The Rental"" is a flop. How this film is doing well amongst other critics is beyond me. The final outcome also raises the question; ""but what's the point of all this?"". I won't break my head to find out.Follow @snobmedia for more reviews!"
"731","The Rental",1,"A waste of time","It feels like such a huge waste of time when you finish this. Do yourself a favor and skip this."
"732","The Rental",8,"A true effective nightmare brought to life.","* There is no end credit scene *Dave Franco in his directional debut! plus crew brought a true effective nightmare to life. The story sets when two couples rent a vacation home and what should have been a fun getaway it turns into horror. A familiar concept, done in different ways, and yet Dave Franco's impressive mind came up with one of the most intense films, a fresh gem for this genre. Everything was perfectly calculated the right balanced buildup of introducing what the characters were about while the desired element lingers in the background, and an outstanding execution when it reaches the climax. The timely suspense was escalating the tension, from the moment it starts the tightness never stopped and loved every second of it. How terrifying it is to think that this could really happen and how also it rings of truth on relationship problems. A common situation in which surrounds the saying ""what goes around comes around"" gets an effective judgment. The ending sequence was flawless and terrifying, there is no better way to end it plus a sharp execution towards the music.I'm amazed by the composers Danny Bensi and Saunder Jurriaans! they really know how to get in your skin with their music! I love their work with the film The Lodge (2019) and now they keep bringing more of their phenomenal sinister vibe.The cast Dan Stevens, Sheila Vand, Jeremy Allen White, and Alison Brie performed amazingly. I have to give it to Dan Stevens, how he keeps nailing every role and his presence gives any scene a unique captivating vibe. Also much-love attention to Sheila Vand, what a beauty and outstanding performance, she needs to do more movies in lead roles like this one."
"733","The Rental",3,"Nothing you havn't seen before.","Dont waste your time...boring build up to a storyline that has been done before....many times."
"734","The Rental",2,"Do yourself a favour, do not rent this. I wish I would have checked out early...","I really wanted to like this movie, unfortunately, there was nothing at all to like. A big calling point of this, for many, will be to see the directional debut of Dave Franco.Well, where to begin? This is yet another 2020 horror film that should not even be classed as a horror film at all. When over 75% of the movie is a drama, then it should be classed that way. There is hardly anything horrifying or thrilling about this one, well, except for the awful production itself. There's hardly any horror elements except for in the very latter part of the movie, even those are poorly executed.None of the characters here are likeable, there's a reason to dislike all of them. I found myself not caring about any of them, well, except for the dog. The pace is slow and the acting is mediocre. The concept itself is familiar and I couldn't help but think that I've seen this before, just executed a hell of a lot better in other movies.It feels like Dave Franco was going for a slow burn type horror that had a stunning conclusion. This is so much of a slow burner that by the time any of the action happened, I was completely disinterested. I stuck around, waiting for the climax and felt greatly let down. The conclusion, is confusing and doesn't offer any real resolve. It's a waste of time and feels like a kick in the teeth after sitting through the rest.The killer himself only gets a few minutes of actual screen time and those happen towards the very end of the film. You find out no information about him, his motive or his purpose. The kills are very weak and not at all graphic.There's literally nothing interesting here at all. A complete lack of atmosphere and tension, it feels very amateurish. Avoid."
"735","The Rental",1,"Do NOT watch this.","Biggest waste of time I have had in a long time watching a movie. The acting wasn't terrible but there is no substance to the movie at all. First half of the movie you wait for something to happen and it never delivers. The story is just bad. Sometimes the ending can redeem a bad movie but not this time. Might give this 3/10 for acting at least, but since the overall score is so high (5.8 atm), it has to be lowered so people don't think this is worth their time. Sorry Dave Franco, try again. Or don't."
"736","The Rental",5,"Plot is not good enough.","While watching the movie I was thinking: this is way to much work for a Peeping Tom (which are usually profiled as cowards) to go through, JUST to get his cameras back. And let alone if people found them they would just blame the owner of the house.Then the very last frame of the movie rolled through and I got my answer. Pretty lame. Like an easy way out for Franco to get away with not writing something better; a more elaborate way to connect the story or give a motive.Directing/screenplay is an 8/10, writing is 2/10. So a 5/10 as a whole."
"737","The Rental",9,"Well made, well acted and pretty scary!","I liked it. The premise is of course not especially original (some friends for the weekend go to a vacation house and are being harassed by strange phenomena and brutal force from un unknown source), but within this genre it's a fine movie with a solid story and pretty good acting. All four characters get some personal depth, the tension is slowly being built up and when things definitely go awry the pace is high and the violent goings-on are pretty scary.After the climax of the movie, there's some sort of epilogue that in a calm and matter-of-fact way shows how things can (and will) happen again, with the cynical message that it can happen to any of us. But this takes like five minutes of very slow images, so after all the turmoil it feels a bit as an anti-climax. Although partly incorporating the closing credits in these images was a nice touch."
"738","The Rental",2,"Terrible Watch","Movie is rated as a drama/thriller more of a horror
Does not even ahow a good ending,no direction,no storyline"
"739","The Rental",3,"I wish I can spend that 1,5 hour on something else","Terrible ending. Used every typical horror trope unironically. No pay off in the end. Dan Stevens was good though."
"740","The Rental",1,"Slow novice actors dumb plot","Biggest waster of 1 1/2 hours eve r. Bad novice acting and dead ending in a nice beach house.."
"741","The Rental",4,"Bland","The Rental is the directorial debut of Dave Franco and tells the story of a couple who rents a vacation home and something goes horribly wrong. It's a formula you saw hundreds of times and this doesn't bring anything new to the table.To no surprise, the weakest points of this movie were the direction and the screenplay, which was also written partly by Dave Franco. The characters were introduced to consist of a has-been prisoner played by Jeremy Allen White, a happy to take drugs Alison Brie and two cheats played by Sheila Vand and Dan Stevens. When your characters are this unlikable it's really hard to care for any of them or to be even remotely invested in this movie which is by its far the biggest issue.The film plays out in the most by the books, cookie-cutter way possible which not only makes it predictable but also horribly boring. On the positive side, the performances were pretty solid and the cast had good enough chemistry. But aside from that pretty much every other aspect including the cinematography, music and editing can be described as generic and bland.The only character I was happy to see survive was the dog.Final Rating - 4/10"
"742","The Rental",6,"Good effort by Franco","Movie has a really good build .acting wise excellent but the issue comes when the movie reaches to final act it's like same thing which u seen before I through this movie is more focus on relationships drama the slasher.but still a good effort from Franco. Hope he make more movies"
"743","The Rental",7,"A thrill ride the last 30 mins","Enjoyed this movie, just got better the last 30 minutes. Good acting, pretty good plot."
"744","The Rental",8,"You'll never rent an Airbnb again !","All you need to know ..good movie, a just watch it and no thinking type of movie, enjoy a glass of wine, great setting and creepy atmosphere...Reggie is great ! And when you watch it you'll never rent another Airbnb again !"
"745","The Rental",4,"Waste of money","This movie was not scary at all. It builds up to an end that has no explanation and leaves you with a bad taste in your mouth because you wasted your money renting it."
"746","The Rental",6,"Worth the time","The director's debut was a success. The picture cannot be called outstanding, but it is certainly very solid. You don't miss a lot in the first half of the film, because nothing much happens. The emphasis is on the relationship between the characters. Although, even in this part, one can note a good camera and acting work. All the fun is left for the second part. It is worth noting the very smooth flow of the whole picture. Even at the most intense moment, you still feel how everything moves smoothly and slowly develops. This is not a traditional horror movie, but rather a drama with horror movie elements. At the same time, it cannot be said that the picture stands out within these genres. She seems to be missing something. For drama - tragedy, for horror - suspense. Fans of drive will not like this film, but I recommend it to everyone else."
"747","The Rental",5,"Did anyone else wanted to know where the dog was?","Personally very much disliked the ending, would've rather seen some more story to it. Also poor Michelle."
"748","The Rental",6,"A neat little thriller that settles for a serviceable climax! [+60%]","To start off, I liked quite a few things about The Rental, Dave Franco's directorial debut. While it deals with the concepts of racial discrimination and voyeurism that have been handled better in other films, The Rental adds a layer of sophisticated relationship chemistry between the four protagonists. They're flawed and vulnerable the way all young people are. While they display composure at first, when the situation starts to turn on them, they lose their cool and start making naive decisions. This complexity being explored to a great extent is what made me like The Rental.The performances are good across the board - Dan Stevens, Alison Brie, Sheila Vand, and Jeremy Allen White - all of them did a neat job with their respective roles. The beautiful hilltop house (with splendid views of the ocean), the foggy night atmosphere, the tension-inducing background score, and the overall restlessness of the screenplay certainly work in the film's favor. From the 30-minute mark, it's mostly an intense, thrill-filled ride all the way. Except for the rather bland climax, I suppose. I really wish there was more to the bad guy and his motive. The Rental may not be the best voyeur thriller out there, but it does make you rethink staying in countryside BnBs or at least, just be a little more careful in that regard."
"749","The Rental",8,"Wow this movie didn't suck like I expected it to","The rental was a movie that I honestly didn't expect to be that good because from the trailer it looked like every other horror movie and honestly it is but this movie is actually pretty good and honestly Dave Franco did a great job with this movie for his first time in the directing chair. There is a lot to like about this movie even though it's not a perfect movie. First of the cast in this movie all do a great job in there respected roles but the 2 main stand outs of this movie have to be Dan Stevens and Alison Brie are both really great in this movie. The music in this movie honestly is really good to and it plays a great part in setting up the creepy autmosphere in this movie. This movie also has pretty good cinematography and also is a really pretty movie. The scares in this movie are very little but when they happen they are very well done and honestly had a chill going down my spine. The movie also doesn't overstay it's welcome it's only a 90 minute movie and that is perfect runtime for this movie. The movie is also a lot of fun to watch. But this is not a perfect movie at all and it does have some problems to it. The characters in this movie are not likeable at all they are all jerks yes Stevens and Brie's characters are the only decent characters in this movie but they are still jerks. The movies also has a lot of horror movie cliches that can't be escaped. Also, this movie does have a lot of interesting plot points that just don't get any looking into which sucks because they were really interesting. Overall, I really liked the rental more than I expected to, yes it's not a perfect horror movie but it's for sure a horror movie you should give a try."
"750","The Rental",6,"Dark and confusing","The movie is dark. I like that. But it also leaves you with a bunch of question marks. It was a bit hastily tied together. Actors were good I thought. Maybe not likeable but doesn't that make sense for this type of movie?"
"751","The Rental",NA,"Suspense and mystery","There is suspense and some mystery, but the ending doesn't answer any questions."
"752","The Rental",4,"What was that?","The first half was about relationships that I couldn't care less about, and the other half some sterile killings, like slaughtering animals.
And once again no conclusion.
What is the director trying to do? Propaganda against Airbnb, so that people use agencies and pay their taxes?"
"753","The Rental",6,"A Solid directorial debut from Dave Franco but not without it's flaws","Dave Franco's writing and directorial debut, The Rental, is a good entry to his portfolio as a new film-maker. It's not a bad start by any means and with further development and experience, I can only imagine that he'll get better. The Rental is a horror/thriller in the style of The Strangers, Last House on The Left, or When a Stranger Calls. The story follows two couples who rent a seaside home for a short vacation and discover that they are being watched by a mysterious presence. The film painstakingly develops each of the characters so that they're not just expendable victims like in other films, this is both good and bad as it explains who these people are, why they are there, and what motives and personality traits they have. However, this intricate process of character development causes the film to take too long to get to the violent tension at the climax of the story. Throughout the duration of the film we're provided with minor details and nuances that hint at a presence or some mysterious event that will eventually unfold. For instance, a locked door, strange items, or a feeling that they're being watched someone somewhere. When all of these things come together and the true story is revealed, the payoff isn't really that great. Alot of the violence is perpetrated offscreen and the ending leaves more to be desired. I would define this are more of a character study set within the backdrop of a home invasion thriller. In that regard, it's OK, if that was the intention."
"754","The Rental",7,"A decisively ominous, tense and enjoyable horror.","This is definitely an enjoyable, immersive horror film especially for those who are staunch fans of the genre. The ominous and tense tone will keep your attention and the acting is absolutely solid which is no surprise considering the actors are all very talented and have skills exceeding those needed to master this film's particular roles. The overall concept centers around a fear that is nothing new in horror/thriller films, however Dave Franco adds some fairly novel twists that makes this movie stand out. Some may complain that the conclusion isn't neat and tidy - but that's something you get used to in with horror, and in this case, it works."
"755","The Rental",1,"Snooze Fest","Why is it some movie makers think people wanna sit through an hour of rambling, and nothingness, before getting to some actual point. Everything doesnt need 60 minute build up. Get to the damn action already. This movie is beyond boring. I didn't even bother to finish it. Do yourself a favor... Find another rental."
"756","The Rental",5,"A heavy nose dive","The Rental checks out as a movie which catches our eyes with the character interaction at the beginning, but at the end that turns out to be the only interesting thing in the movie. Both the screenplay and direction would have been better. The entirety of the movie felt like an episode of a TV show with a Michael Myers type villain. Overall it's definitely a one time watch."
"757","The Rental",5,"Predictable but could be good","The good thing - The cast & the acting were all great, Dan Stevens handsome as hell, he's always great.
The bad thing - Story line are predictable and flat..Not much suspense which was kinda bored at first..The flick only happens towards the ending..A COPYCAT Halloween movie invasion maybe lol..I always support any Indie or small budget films but this one could have been improved."
"758","The Rental",7,"Good Horror","I don't know what all the negativity about. I thought this was great. Gave me a proper chill!!"
"759","The Rental",7,"Good movie where last part looked from different writer","The first 3/4 of the movie was great. Slow paced but great tension and the characters really lifted the story. Too bad the last part had to be totally different and became an average slasher horror like so many others and the same ending like so many other slasher horrors. In the end i liked the movie but it could have been so much more if the sticked with the writing part of the beginning."
"760","The Rental",7,"Tense.","I went into this movie completely cold, knowing nothing but the title, and I think that's how the movie is best viewed. It's a very tense Rube Goldberg like machine. You put a set amount of well played and developed characters into a house and just watch as things go wrong and wrong and wrong. Don't know why it had to turn into a horror movie though, it worked best before that point."
"761","The Rental",9,"Hard to believe a film this good was a debut effort from Franco","While watching 'The Rental' I kept wondering to myself who the director was, because the film was made with a lot of class clearly. Then the credits rolled and I saw Dave Franco's name appear and I thought it must have been a mistake. I knew he was married to the film's star Alison Brie, but I also knew that he had never directed anything before, let alone a film this good. This is an incredible debut from him, and not only did he direct it but he wrote it too. Anyone who can breathe fresh life into a genre as tired as the horror one is deserves a lot of credit. Perhaps his future is held behind the camera rather than in front of it.The film blew me away by how patient it was. It only runs for 88 minutes, yet it was so happy to slowly set the story up, all the while only giving us small hints as to what the actual danger was to these characters. There is a cheap jump-scare or two early on that the film could have done without, but otherwise the first half of this film is extremely well done in the sense that we know there is danger, but we don't know who, how or what. It adds a mysterious element to the film that I absolutely loved.Then the final act kicks into gear and the film goes into overdrive. Very rarely anymore is a film able to raise my heart-rate or get me on the edge of my seat, but 'The Rental' did both. The scare sequences aren't conventional and I think that's why they worked. It was impossible to predict exactly what was coming next. I had a terrific time with this film and would highly recommend people give it a watch."
"762","The Rental",7,"A nice horror movie full of surprises","This is the story of two couples who go to a beach house for a weekend. After the first night, stranges things start happening. The story was full of surprises. It is hard to predict the next scene. I liked the acting crew. Dan Stevens played awesome like always. The angles of the camera and the movements of it were amazing. I loved the background music. My favorite scene is the chasing scene in the woods. In summary, I recommend this movie to fans of horror and thriller genres."
"763","The Rental",10,"For a directorial debut! Very good","Dave Franco, widely known for comedy, branches out this time to horror instead of being in front of the camera he's behind it. Having written and directed this fun horror I can't wait to see what's next."
"764","The Rental",10,"Wow!!! Well done.","Ignore the haters. It's great !!! Well done.
A nice slow burn."
"765","The Rental",1,"Boring and depressing. A movie about every character's need for retirement","The movie does a better job at highlighting everyone's need for retirement. Everyone in this movie is tired of their careers and problems at home that they all just want to retire-The Warden, her husband, the prison's priest , Woods' lawyer.What a depressing movie. It fails to deliver on its plot or theme."
"766","The Rental",4,"Good beginning frustrating ending","Movie was gripping but in the end you didn't get a clue who the killer was"
"767","The Rental",NA,"Scary and Creepy...but, why?","Spoiler-free. I like the new trend of thrillers and horror movies digging into relationships (Midsommar etc.) as the focus of the plot line. This story of a weekend rental for two couples that goes seriously awry due to their own faulty choices and relationship tension is beautifully shot, well produced, and has a thought-provoking undercurrent especially at the end. I'm giving this a higher rating as it's not formulaic, the story is realistic, and the theme is very current. Plus I was completely freaked out and had to fast forward through one part. To me that earns a higher rating since I am an accomplished horror movie lover and am a tad jaded. HOWEVER, just why? The ending (last third of the film) was like having a mediocre dessert at the end of a great meal. The meal was so good, but you're let down and a little disappointed at the end. But, you still had a good meal. That experience is this movie."
"768","The Rental",10,"A reality check!","A depiction of real life that we all need to know and be aware of. Only a predator would be offended. It's a true reality check for us all!!"
"769","The Rental",10,"Amazing movie - great first film from Dave franco","I thought this film was great - don't listen to the haters and false reviews of this film. This is Dave franco's first film he's directed and it's great. It's not meant to rely on cheap jump scares like any other horror film."
"770","The Rental",2,"Skipped thru scenes... Meh.","So I skipped thru scenes because this film was just meh. Airbnb couples rents out a fabulous home for the weekend there is one act of infidelity and host of killings.... Meh. Absolutely nothing new to write home about at all. Because of its predictably, I only watched the killing scenes. And the ending? It was a real WTF are you serious?....type ending. A watch if you have nothing else better to do type film."
"771","The Rental",4,"Unintentionally funny","Its not a bad movie, nor its a great movie. If you like to watch really, really silly characters doing everything in their power to screw themselves over its a fun ride."
"772","The Rental",9,"Thrilling ride!!!","This movie is gonna be underrated and it shouldn't be! I am such a fan of Allison Bre so I was excited to see this movie considering it is Dave Franco's directing debut. I was not disappointed in the film. It starts off pretty slow, but halfway through the movie it gets so much better. Unpredictable flick. I was the most impressed with Shelia Vands performance and I'm excited to see her take on more mainstream roles!"
"773","The Rental",6,"Doer Upper with potential....","""The Rental"" is a ""doer upper"" with ""potential""...This is a basic but functional horror film with a simple framework that's in need of a little extra TLC. In short, it gets the basic's right with a workable premise but delivers mostly perfunctory, rather than spine chilling scares.In the latter half of the film, you really get the feeling to a degree, that its going through the motions. That said, It does have its moments. The scene with the car window and the end to the final pursuit, work extremely well.I suspect this film leaves the door open to a second or third ""house call"". Indeed, I hope they pursue this further, taking a little extra time, to craft more of the nail biting and jump scare's, horror viewers crave.6/10."
"774","The Rental",4,"Average AirBnB crime thriller","Nothing extraordinary about this film. Creepy property owner spy on renters with hidden cams. Stolen from real life news headlines about AirBnB. This is really a crime thriller than it is a horror film. Renters are two couple of Wokerati millennials that unfairly judge the property owner's brother as being ""racist"" against a woman with a common Islamic name and later the White Knight boyfriend beats the hell out of the old man and nearly killing him.I'll leave it at that so not to spoil the film. But the dialog is terribly boring. The dialog is mostly how the couples first met and some previous dating history; then stuff happens."
"775","The Rental",10,"Review","Got the mind of a lazy navy seal released from standing their body. Ever slept near a tictak for 88 hours while blocking a direct scream? There's a place in france called ignore the pipe. It's an ally way. What you would do is stare into it and see a man on the floor pointing a lead pipe at the moon. The next thing that could happen is you'd find enough gold on the floor to purchase a barge. And, of course youd eventually find yourself peaking out from inside it whispering ""the sun has a tracking device on it""<U+0001F1E9><U+0001F1EA>"
"776","The Rental",10,"True Horror","Great thrillers are rare, which is why The Rental should be treasured as a true-to-its-roots slow burning thriller. The Rental successfully manages to invoke longstanding horror traditions in a relevant, modern, and believable setting. The film is solid all around and excels at providing the audience with relatable and believable characters - something very few films are capable of in today's unoriginal, bland film industry. This goes triple for the horror genre, which is saturated with cliche jump scares and gore without any semblance of character development or realism. Although it relies on classic horror elements and twists, The Rental provides a refreshing take that guarantees a edge of your seat experience for even seasoned horror fans."
"777","The Rental",9,"Wow!","I'm sorry, $crew the haters. D. Franco <U+0001F44F> This was good!"
"778","The Rental",4,"Cliche cliche cliche","Almost gave 5 stars. But while writing review, I changed my mind. I'm 40 years old and assume I'm a bit older than director/actor Dave Franco.... But I have a sneaking suspicion that he's maybe never seen a horror movie released between 1975 and on....
Was stoked to watch this movie. Constantly looking for decent suspense/horror/survival/slasher flicks nowadays.
But this movie almost seemed like watching an ""updated"" Full length version of the first 30 minutes of I Know What You Did Last Summer. With plot influences from about 3 other movies.
Dave! Please watch more horror movies"
"779","The Rental",7,"Really enjoyed this","Happily surprised to it directed by Franco. The cinematography is beautiful. Great actors. What's not to like?"
"780","The Rental",10,"Much better than these reviews are painting it","This movie had my wife and me on the edge of our seats the whole time. It opened with multiple potential conflicts so you didn't even know which was going to come to the forefront. In the end they were all explored AND there was a high level of tension the whole time. I don't know what other people look for in horror/suspense but this movie was well written, acted, paced, and much more than I was expecting from all the (excessively) harsh reviews on here."
"781","The Rental",6,"Not Bad !!","This is a Thriller/Slasher movie.
Very slow burner.
Cast is fine,but the Cop out ending will disappoint most."
"782","The Rental",3,"Could have been a decent movie","The plot is rather good, two couples renting a beautiful house by the sea. Someone is watching them, scaary!The drama part of the movie is good, the acting as well!That's about it, it's some thrilling scenes last 5 minutes of the movie but not more then that!"
"783","The Rental",5,"A little below average","The film is slightly below average for me. Considering this was Dave Franco's first movie, it was done well enough. This film is much more of a character driven thriller than a horror. The cinematography as well as the acting are strongpoints of the film. However the writing is a little bland and I just didn't care much for the characters. There are a few plot holes which are annoying but can be overlooked. Another weaker part of the film was the soundtrack. Much more suspense could have been generated with more punch from a good soundtrack in the right spots."
"784","The Rental",4,"Same old story, nothing new...","Always starts with a bunch of smart people going somewhere, then weird things start to happen, one glitch turns into a massive pile of mess, every decision they make is wrong and stupid. If you've seen this type movie, you can pass this one, nothing new."
"785","The Rental",7,"The Tension!","This starts slow but really builds. Stick with it, it gets so tense!!"
"786","The Rental",NA,"Successful chiller from a first-time director.","Writer/director Dave Franco's first directorial debut, The Rental, has enough of the horror, thriller tropes to make the genre's devotees happy. For the rest of us who merely want a straightforward depiction about what can go wrong with two couples vacationing together on the Oregon coast, satisfaction is within reach.Relative depth of characterization and expert acting supported by reasonable suspense reveal what we really know and how we react to the unknown. Case in point: Charlie (Dan Stevens) and Michele (Alison Brie) are experiencing Charlie's business success, and his brother Josh (Jeremy Allen White) and his wife, Charlie's new partner, Mina (Sheila Vand), join them in a typically stylish coastal rental to celebrate.Franco smartly distributes his exposition before disclosing the identity of the genre-requisite stalker. More so does he slowly expose the real stalker-the attraction of Charlie and Mina, which leads to indiscretion that leads to mayhem between the couples. What Franco is careful to preserve is the realism of dissembling characters and the effects of their ill-considered actions.While a surveillance motif is prominent-cameras all over the house most notably in the shower (several Hitchcock similarities)-it is within the consciences of the miscreants that the disclosure of their secrets weighs most heavily. The utterly human urge to sin and hide the disclosure is more potent than the suspicion that the property manager, Taylor (Toby Huss), is a wacko stalker.The first hour and 10 minutes or so are expertly low-key, building to naughtiness and death with an unusually small set of jump scares and red herrings. Franco remains true to the operative motif that mining information and letting it go is the most lethal act of all.The Rental outstrips star Kevin Bacon's recent You Should Have Left if for nothing else because it's the fraught relationships that menace, not the stalkers. Bacon was mostly interior-The Rental is people.Yes, The Rental will make you pause before you take on Airbnb."
"787","The Rental",7,"Franco's lispy brother now wants to be a director.","In competent hands, this would have been a great movie but it settles for being average. Reasons: out of place, beginner dialogue that throws subtlety right out of the window and way too many ""that totally wouldn't happen in real life"" scenarios. It's not as atrocious as some reviewers are claiming it to be, as the idea is there but it's the execution that faltered. One extra point for being a remote location thriller/horror/slasher that seem to have vanished off late."
"788","The Rental",NA,"Disregard negative reviews","I watch a lot of movies, some good, many bad. This was well written, sharp, stylish and dark. I definitely did not see it turning into the type of movie it ended up being. The ending left me me properly creeped out and with goosebumps. Well done."
"789","The Rental",3,"Shame","As with so many , horror , slashers, the ending ruins it for me.I dont think this is a spoiler, to say, but dont root for anyone or get any emotional connection. If you are OK with that, then let the good times roll."
"790","The Rental",7,"NOT AS BAD AS PEOPLE THINK.","The movie builds nicely, good actors in this one, playing on various relatable subjects such as relationships and identity, and what made this enjoyable is that the entire thing could be a real situation, nothing too far out, but it throws all away at the end for a conclusion I'm not sure if I couldn't figure out because it was completely meaningless + unrelated to the rest of the movie, or because there was nothing there."
"791","The Rental",8,"Ratings aren't accurate! Armchair Expert > My watching = Loved it!!!","Heard his interview today on Armchair Expert with Dax and Monica - Dave Franco did an EXCELLENT job on this project - casting was great, mood was fantastic and I am not at ALL A HORROR fan - I loved it for every minute!!Way to go D. Franco!! You should be very proud of this directorial debut!"
"792","The Rental",10,"In a few years you will look back and realize the brilliance of this movie!","Well, this is my first review here, and I hardly care to even if I like the movie. Reason being is that I think 'complaining' has become the audience's norm these days. Too much available consumption and little time to appreciate. I had to literary unsubscribe from two long time movie review channels on YouTube for putting this movie down.If you care to hear me out, let me explain:1)
If you've ever traveled enough times to find yourself worried about being watched in an airbnb (especially abroad), you will love this movie. Tackling the subject with a horror / thriller genre just hit home for be.2)
Let's talk about directing. For a first time directer; fantastic. The scene in the end with Mina by the cliff is the most subtle 'hold your breath' I've seen this year. I mean the few seconds you need to understand what really happened. Wow. Not only was it surprising and metaphorical, but it actually flipped the genre on its head.3)
Let's talk acting. I believed everyone. Not to say I loved them. This isn't that kind of movie. People are real, stupid and selfish like all of us. But are they underdeveloped? Hell no. I didn't need to know more about them. I understood them perfectly that their decisions in the last few minutes came natural to me.4)
And now let's talk the two things I liked the most about the movie:
a - Tension. Tension. Tension. Sometimes inconsistent or slow, and sometimes you're not sure whether this is a thriller or horror or drama (though you do in the last ten minutes) but I enjoyed every moment.
b - The ending. It's not that big reveal or twist, but the way it's presented, that's the horror. Again two strikes in one. You get to have an unusual and different ending and (don't want to spoil anything) it's terrifying because of what it MEANS, not what you SEE.I lOVED this movie and will watch it again.In the end, I always remind myself that The Shining was a flop when it was first released. Is the Rental as good, not there, yet. But If Dave Franco grows into two more movies of this caliber, he will come up with something as good. You can sense it. I want to see his next."
"793","The Rental",8,"overall is too good but endingless","Overall.. the actor is very talented, the plot was very good, the sett and angle it was prety brilliant, in the a hour im prety sure the movie was end closer too beyond my expectation, but why not really seriously for the point? but not really bad for the firs time Dave Franco.. congratulation, will be wait for the next movie!!"
"794","The Rental",7,"Really envolving story, great directing","What an amazing directorial debut for Dave Franco! He doesn't fall into the cliches of the genre and uses the serial killer stalker really well. Best movie of this kind i've seen in a long time. See it!"
"795","The Rental",9,"Different, unpredictable, believable","Way more interesting than I expected from reading all the negative reviews. Amazing screenplay, seems totally real and cinvincing, and very well played. These are ordinary people, could be one of us. Unlike many fashionable films today, the camera work does not distract from the story, but actually helps to tell it. Kudos to Dave Franco. The ending is very un-Hollywood. That and the realism probably account for all the negative reviews here. It's way better than the usual horror flick, which fortunately it is not. Devoid of sentimentality or gimmicks (digital or otherwise), maybe it is not surprising most movie goers don't care for it."
"796","The Rental",7,"I re-evaluated this movie at the time I was writing this review","While this film made my brain hurt a couple of times because of how unrealistic and stupid the characters were, I reassessed my thoughts on this one when I was writing this.The film gets much better if you finish it, even though it is incredibly painful to watch so much stupidity at times. Many things in this make no sense but I don't want to get into spoilers. The weirdest thing, probably, was the awkward racism and misogyny commentaries, these felt really out of place.Why I gave this 7 instead of a 4 or 5 is because I'm almost sure that due to the way the ending was shot, this film is not a case of the creators messing up, this was quite intentional and was made in this specific way to emphasize certain key points.I can't say this though about the whole film, since it is very inconsistent and barely believable at times, but the core idea, again, if intentional, is worth it. I can't really discuss it without diving into spoilers, but I loved the vibe that makes you feel like you're watching a crime mystery documentary. I love how methodical and cold it got in the end (powered by a great soundtrack). I really hope that the message I got from this film was the one the creators wanted me to understand.Thus, in my head, this film came all the way from garbage to an interesting experience.P.S. The poster seriously misrepresents this film, it looks like the film is about aliens or something."
"797","The Rental",5,"Meh","Pacing in these elevated horror movies has been awful the last 4-5 years... You leave literally 20 minutes for all the tense scenes with no gore for an hour and a half movie based on wacky tech bro hipster relationships.... Could have been way better."
"798","The Rental",6,"Familiar ground, tensely done","With The Rental, first-time feature director Dave Franco has crafted a slow-burning thriller that's nicely tense even if it doesn't feel completely original. It's a movie that probably fits best into the home invasion category, but the on-screen violence is kept to a minimum. Instead, The Rental focuses heavily on building characters and their complicated relationships, so when the bad stuff starts happening, the characters' reactions feel more natural and understandable within the context of the movie. You might feel like you've seen movies like this before (and you probably have), but the acting is great, the writing is solid, and the direction brings everything together in a satisfying way that makes the movie enjoyable even if you can predict what's about to happen next."
"799","The Rental",6,"Solid six.......","First off I did not like the characters in the beginning, especially Mina. You can tell she is a leftist lib / millennial type. Californians are strange. Very predictable and rushed. It was not until about midway through the movie did I finally get over how strange or bad the acting / direction was in the first thirty minutes or so. It seemed rush and predictable. With that being said, the last 45 min was the best part of the film, it was scary and had some moments where you jumped. Its a one and done type of movie, but worth the 1 1/2 to see."
"800","The Rental",8,"Great for debut horror by Dave Franco","The original promotion for this film was very minimal showing really nothing. I believe a more in depth trailer may have come out after the first teaser but I went into this movie with no expectations. I'm really glad I watched it because it was probably one of the best horror/suspense films I've watched in awhile. It's always best when you have a very limited cast for a thriller or horror film, it keeps things nice and tight. I was entertained through out the entire film and for this being Dave Franco's big debut, I am much impressed. I would advise him to keep it up with the horror genre... we need more good producers & writers for horror. Definitely a fun movie, with a very intense final half hour. I recommend."
"801","Hamilton",10,"I felt like i was there!","I mean, i WAS pretty high, but still.It definitely lived up to my hype."
"802","Hamilton",10,"This is how musicals should be done for screen","Although many musical adaptations have flopped this may have proved that best way to do it is simply film the play. What you get is one of the best musicals available to watch whenever you like at an affordable price. Great work by everyone involved especially Lin Manuel Miranda."
"803","Hamilton",10,"Next best thing to live","I've been lucky enough to catch the show on tour in Minneapolis and it was amazing. As another reviewer said, this is how all Broadway productions should be released - not all Hollywood stylized - but a live filmed production of the original cast before an audience. About as close to perfection as you can get it."
"804","Hamilton",10,"BEAUTIFUL","I'm a mexican boy who has never got the chance to go to Broadway, all I've seen are bootlegs, and they're fine but not like this. This is a beautiful shot of the great spectacle Hamilton is, the flawless music of Lin Manuel Miranda, the production, the photography, costumes. And the acting, Leslie Odom Jr., Renneè, Miranda and Daveed Diggs shine on their roles, I don't know is this can be nominated for any award, but damn it deserves it"
"805","Hamilton",10,"MASTERPIECE","This movie, who is an original Broadway production, is without a doubt the best movie of this decade and everyone should watch this."
"806","Hamilton",10,"I love it","I had always wondered what the hype was about and now I know.. and I am obsessed. This musical features extraordinary actors, actresses, singers, and rappers. I know and love many musicals, but this one certainly takes the cake."
"807","Hamilton",9,"Something truly original & entertaining with the WOW factor","Hamilton is a fantastic modern musical of which there was no hype about it in the UK - not that I noticed anyway.
It was something advertised on Disney + that I just decided to watch due to having time to kill because of the COVID-19 quarantine! ...but WOW. I was blown away, I'm English & knew nothing of American history (I do now).
I never knew who Hamilton was, so I went into this rather blindly and naively. This show somehow manages to do what other stage productions have not successfully achieved; make that leap to a film and be incredible, breathtaking and executed impeccably.
I was delighted by the modern rap, the casting, the jazz, the virtuosity of the actors, the rap battle (what a giggle in itself) the close up expressions (which you miss in a theatre & greatly enhanced by the expertise of the performers), the stage choreography & the humour. American humour doesn't usually bring a smile to my face, let alone make me laugh. Hamilton however, managed to break this pattern and had me giggling out loud all by myself.
Being English I had to write a review to let other Brits know how fantastic this film/show is & how it will entertain them too. Don't pass this up just cause you think it's going to be some boring US history stage show that won't quite make it, cause this is anything but that!
I never rate anything 10. Although I rated this 9/10, I must admit, I did deliberate scoring my first 10 over this show.
I recommend you watch this, you won't be disappointed. It's quite unlike anything I've seen before. Thoroughly entertained from start to finish. In fact it was so splendid, nothing I watch in the near future will come close to satisfying me half as much as Hamilton managed to achieve. Plus I learnt something through osmosis- :-)"
"808","Hamilton",10,"Dying is easy, living is harder.","This was fantastic. A musical so amazingly done! The characters and singing are fantastic! Auto tune has taken over the music department but not with this! These are their real voices! 10/10!"
"809","Hamilton",10,"""The Story of America Then, Told by America Now""","The time has come. The lights go down. King George III welcomes us to the show. Hamilton has finally arrived in a beautiful HD presentation! You've heard of it, you've listened to it more times than you can count, you've bopped to it and belted the words on your friend's aux to their absolute shock/confusion. Now we can FINALLY enjoy it on loop over and over again on a non bootleg copy, that's right NO MORE SLIME
TUTORIALS! Considering it's called a ""Hamilton film I would say it's right in my ballpark don't you?? First of all, the show is amazing. It's among the best the stage has to offer in the modern age. The music, the performances, the writing, the production, it's all BEAUTIFUL, if you haven't seen it yet WATCH IT NOW, but what truly makes it SO good? In the words of Lin Manuel Miranda, ""It's a story about America then, as told by America now."" The Founding Fathers are played by actors of color, among other characters featured in the story. The show is having us leave whatever cultural baggage we have about these historical figures at the door, and embracing this story through the eyes of America NOW. Yes it does leave some factors out, yes it's not all historically accurate, but people need to realize the point isn't to tell an IN DEPTH biographical story of Hamilton, but rather show us how his life and the events that he took part in helped form the foundations and ideals of what this country was built upon. This show is very Patriotic but it reminds me of what America is SUPPOSE TO BE. WHAT IT COULD BE. Much like the young people of my generation going out and marching for the racial injustices in this country, Hamilton was a 20 year old immigrant that fought for the freedom of this land and helped shaped the principles in which we aspire to uphold. This show isn't going to acknowledge our systemic racism roots with people like Washington and Jefferson who factually owned slaves, but it challenges us to contemplate our OWN feelings about this country and where we came from. How far have we come? What has changed and what could WE do better? Could our founding fathers have done more to abolish slavery? Absolutely, but think about what they did try to create and lay the foundations for. Who knows what they could've done if they had more time? It's not meant to idolize these people, it's a piece about the birth of America, and what people like Hamilton did to help a struggling new country find its own identity. When I watch/listen to this show, I believe in that. I believe that America WAS already great, we just lost sight of it and let the wrong people get in charge. If you want to know why, watch Hamilton. The story of an immigrant that fought in a war, and made a name for himself in a ludicrous political game, is a story that will be remembered for generations. Miranda and his team found an incredible medium to tell these people's stories, and that's what it's all about, who tells our story? How will we be remembered? Hamilton's now available on Disney+, I highly suggest you watch it for your 4th of July this weekend and many days after... But as a final reminder don't forget, this is at its heart, live theatre. Hopefully when Covid ends we can actually experience it all together the way we're suppose to, in front of the stage, LIVE. But for now, this will of course do! 10/10."
"810","Hamilton",10,"Stunning and Brilliant","WOW speechless after watching this. A true masterpiece. After years of curiosity I can't believe it lived up to and surpassed the intense hype. It really is beyond special and I think everyone should see it. Profoundly moving and extremely entertaining."
"811","Hamilton",10,"I wish I could give this more stars!","This musical is incredible! It doesn't loose your interest for a second. Even if you aren't a musical theatre fan I promise if you try this you will be converted. It's quirky, it's fun, it's quick, it's clever and it will leave you engrossed. The cast is brilliant and the show has a modern twist."
"812","Hamilton",10,"A Nonstop Display of Awe, Wonder, Theater Magic, and History!","Hamilton is a wonderful modern telling of an important historical figure. What makes the film incredible is the jaw-dropping performances, the incredibly entertaining set design and costumes, the impecable story-telling through rap, and the addicting music. I had listened to the album WAY before I was able to see the musical, so I had an idea of what to expect. However, the musical was nothing like what I expected. It exceeded all my preconceived notions about the film. 10/10 is still not sufficient of a rating. I would give it a 11/10! Lin-Manuel Miranda is a master at his craft and I hope that his future films are at least ALMOST as good as Hamilton (for I do not think Hamilton will ever be surpassed by Lin's future and/or past projects). Please watch this film to be entertained and to learn some history! HIGHLY recommend."
"813","Hamilton",9,"America then, as told by America now, is a memorable performance that left me in awe","Hamilton is a musical that never left me bored throughout it's almost three hour runtime. For years I thought this musical was kind of on a meme level because it's a musical mixing hip hop music, as well as R&B, pop, soul, and traditional-style show tunes, with history of the birth of United States of American and it's been parodied mercilessly, mostly by Jack Douglass, better known as jacksfilms, who created multiple videos of that sort and probably is one of the reasons why it's a common belief now that Alexander Hamilton was a president of the United States of America. In reality, the musical was really good and I enjoyed it. It's really memorable and I felt happy, motivated, proud, anxious, and sad - that's a lot of different emotion that I've felt for a representation of one the american founding fathers.The lyrics are surprisingly good, even memorable, some of the choruses are still at the back of my mind, and I liked the performance by the cast. By the end, where everyone took a bow for the audience, I was even surprised because I thought there were more actors on the stage than there actually were.I also really liked the comedy aspect of the musical. Some rhymed dialogues really made me laugh, chuckle at least and I really appreciated the humor."
"814","Hamilton",10,"Excellent Show","Hamilton is an excellent show with amazing performances and great choreography! I have listened to the album and now have been watching on streaming service Disney+"

"817","Hamilton",9,"I Never Thought I'd Watch Hamilton...","...and then my girlfriend has streamed it about a bazillion times in the last week. Now I have catchy show tunes stuck in my head, of which I can only remember 1 or two phrases from.
In retaliation to this deluge of infectious ear candy I have begun to belt these phrases out around the house as if I am Renee Goldsberry. And any rhyme ending in ""-ur"" get's the "", Sir"" from here on out.Well played Mr. Manuel, well played indeed."
"818","Hamilton",10,"Theatre is so powerful","What an absolute joy, the cast and the production are mesmerising. Utterly compelling and addictive, I can't get it out of my head - neither do I want. Thank you for sharing and for your talent! Support theatre!!"
"819","Hamilton",10,"Hamilton v Burr","Incredible! Thank you Disney! Finalllly The Rock Voice. The Cadence of the Rap Verse Flows were so flawless esp from Daveed! Loved the Assemble Cast! Staging Lighting Costume piece great. Lin Manuel what a gem. Renee Elise Goldsberry honarable mention."
"820","Hamilton",8,"Grateful for the captions, the pause button, and Wikipedia.","I started watching this out of curiosity and to say I have seen it, being the cultural touchstone that it is. At first, I was a little detached, not liking the songs too much, and thinking I would probably just skip through to end in a minute. I couldn't stop watching and it really sucked me in. I have to say, I'm not sure I would have enjoyed it at all, live in the theater. I benefited greatly from the captions and the ability to put it on pause to consult Wikipedia from time to time. The lyrics were so clever and really told the story. I ended up very moved and almost cheering at the end. Of course, now that I am familiar with the story, I would love to see it live and would enjoy it immensely. But I would strongly recommend this for a first time viewing. I will definitely re-watch. And probably again and again."
"821","Hamilton",9,"I can't believe it's this good","Never believe the hype. I didn't believe it. For years I had heard so much about a play about of all people Alexander Hamilton-but done to rap or something similar? Can't be good and maybe offensive. But then the noise of its greatness never quieted. So when it finally came to my town I had to see it. But first I listened to the soundtrack. I was hooked. Despite mezzanine seating I was floored how good the play was. I repeated the soundtrack. Day after day and the message became clearer. News of a movie but then a live taping with the original cast. I couldn't wait. Up close made all the lyrics more amazing. The story was better than I recalled. Outstanding performances. I truly loved it."
"822","Hamilton",10,"It's like a drug.","It's like a drug. You must keep watching and each time is incredible"
"823","Hamilton",10,"A omanticization of America's Founding Fathers or a message from Miranda?","A common critique of Hamilton has been that it's a disgraceful attempt to rewrite our history and romanticize our founding fathers as many of them were slaveowners. This article seeks to address this critique. Did Disney release this movie ahead of its original release date to address the divides in our country? Could Miranda actually be illustrating that America and our country is an unfinished symphony?"
"824","Hamilton",10,"Satisfying!","I love this movie. I saw this recently and I liked everything about it. It really was a good idea to film the musical into a movie. The songs are great. The choreography is amazing. The acting is spectacular. I'm so glad that this splendid classic musical was brought to our Televisions by Disney! Alexander Hamilton himself would be satisfied at last."

"827","Hamilton",10,"Brilliant Broadway Show.","Review:
'Hamilton' is a Broadway musical filmed for TV with music and lyrics by Lin-Manuel Miranda. It tells the story of American Founding Father Alexander Hamilton. The show's music draws heavily from hip hop, as well as R&B, pop, soul, and traditional-style show tunes.
I've heard about the Broadway musical for years now but being located in a small town there was no way I would be able to see the show. When I heard it was coming to Disney+ I was both excited and nervous due to the fact I wasn't sure if it would be a victim of overhype. I'm am happy to be able to say this is a true masterpiece of a show that will make you want to revisit it again and again,
The show casts non-white actors as the Founding Fathers and other historical figures and it is truly brilliant. It showcases the actor's talents and makes a stand against racial stereotypes and Xenophobia. It is both amazing and heartbreaking watching these actors on the big stage. They are brilliant in the way the move and remember their lines during this three-hour long event. Stage shows and their actors are an underappreciated form of art and storytelling. Everybody in this show did a perfect job, but there was one actor who seemed to be having a blast in his role and played two completely different character perfectly, Daveed Diggs.
Aside from having an incredible story of the 'lost' Founding Father, Alexander Hamilton, the show has a brilliant soundtrack that has seamless transitions between scenes. It keeps your eyes glued to the screen and you don't want the show the end. With having super limited space and production design, they were able to showcase different parts of the world and the United States just by having different dress codes and props, and it is done with ease.
Overall, I am urging everybody to watch this amazing piece of art. If you are a fan of musicals you will love this, and if you aren't the biggest fan of musicals I truly believe that the music in this show alone will keep you engage and intrigued to what the story is telling.
5/5"
"828","Hamilton",10,"SPECTACULARY PERFECT!","I laughed, I cried, I enjoyed, I loved! This musical hit me deeply. I can't say enough what an amazing job the cast and crew did. Through a lot of it, my family and I questioned how you could create something so beautiful, something so unimaginably amazing that made an impact on people, we questioned how you could take a founding father's life and make it into this. Our answer? A Latino that sure knows how to represent us. His name is Lin-Manuel Miranda. I couldn't be more proud of my heritage, even though I've always been proud of it. Long story short, I MOST CERTAINLY recommend watching ""Hamilton"", or if not, listen to the soundtrack!"
"829","Hamilton",10,"Just amazing","I have seen it three times on the stage in London and now to appreciate the original cast is awesome. It is by far the cleverest musical of all time."
"830","Hamilton",10,"Before this, I could count the number of musicals I've enjoyed on the fingers of one finger.","I could watch this eight more times before running out of hands."
"831","Hamilton",10,"Fantastic recording, fantastic musical","As close to being in the theater as you can get. Great recording, great performances, catchy music, and a compelling story."
"832","Hamilton",10,"Nothing short of an 'Awesome, wow!'","As a huge fan of the soundtrack, this was such an amazing experience as it is truly an unprecedented capture. Without having seen the show before you don't realize how much Groff and Ramos steal the show, as they added the most contextual yet non-singing moments. It really puts into perspective how much of a phenomenon it really is. 10 out of 10, would watch again, I hope they release it on digital and DVD at some point."
"833","Hamilton",10,"Loved it.","Just finished watching Hamilton about ten minutes ago. Now I understand what all the hype was about. This is one of those rare times in the 21st century: BELIEVE THE HYPE!"
"834","Hamilton",10,"A groundbreaking phenomenon.","""Hamilton"" takes a giant leap from stage to screen and couldn't be more sensational, outstanding and groundbreaking.
.
In this broadway musical, it tells the life story of one of America's founding fathers and first Secretary of the Treasury, Alexander Hamilton. Captured live on Broadway from the Richard Rodgers Theater with the original Broadway cast.
.
Having never seen the broadway production, this screen adaptation made me feel like I was right there. Lin-Manuel Miranda is the definition of creative genius. The book, the music, the rhymes and a great story; how does he do it all? Everyone in the supporting cast is exceptional as well and the screen direction from Thomas Kail is jaw dropping. When speaking about how ""Hamilton"" is a pop-culture phenomenon; how can it not be? The hype is real, people. Here are actors of colour playing the white-ass founding fathers. Right there, ballsy. The music is whole other thing that I'll be listening to for the next six months. The entire ""Hamilton"" experience is a must-see - it left me floored and I would love to see it live eventually.

"835","Hamilton",10,"Almost perfect.","Nearly flawless execution. Incredible performance, beautiful camera work, the quality of the material speaks for itself.However, D+ lost a star for censorship, which is just a shame any time it happens to art. If they weren't comfortable with the language of the performance, they should have put it up on Hulu.All that said, it's still a majorly incredible performance. Would recommend to literally anyone."
"836","Hamilton",9,"A great gift to humanity during the virus","Hamilton became the most popular musical in recent years for a good reason. It tells an interesting story through beautiful lyrics, music, and acting. The Broadway musical is incredible, and anyone who was able to see it in person are extremely lucky. With the recording finally released, anyone can get the front row feeling in their home.To the many who have listened to Hamilton countless times, this is your movie. To the many who have never seen Hamilton and know nothing about the revolutionary war, this is your movie. Hamilton tells the story of a founding father. It tells of his success through his many failures and flaws.Personally, I loved the recording. It felt very well produced. The mixing was great, except I felt like some songs could have been louder for emphasis. An additional thing that I would like to say is that there is no autotune in this recording, which makes these three shine: Christopher Jackson, Daveed Diggs, and Phillipa Soo.9/10, very rewatchable."
"837","Hamilton",9,"A great musical!","Who tells your story? Who tells my story? Talk less, smile more. Tonight I saw the musical Hamilton (2020) on Disney+. To begin with let me tell you I do know a little about the founding fathers of America, but not the story of Hamilton (1) and I am not an American, but born and raise in The Netherlands (2). And before I say more, the musical is just great.I like all the players, the costumes, the dance and the songs. When you ask me who of the five players you like best I would say Lin-Manuel Miranda as Hamilton, Daveed Diggs as Lafayette/Thomas Jefferson, Renée Elise Goldsberry as Angelica Schuyler, Jonathan Groff as King George (such a great performance!) and Chris Jackson as George Washington. Offcourse a great compliment for Miranda, who was also responsible for the story and music; he also was one of the producers.There where great scenes and songs throughout. I find the hip-hop awesome from the beginning to the end. As a not-American I had a little time to adjust, but with the capital on a little time. With the first song going I became fascinated. Okay yes, the best enjoyment would be to have been there live. Never the less, seeing it on your television has also positive things for it to say. Some scenes you can see from a different angle and you get some fine close-ups. To end, as said, a great musical I enjoyed very much."
"838","Hamilton",10,"Genius","Lin-Manuel Miranda is a genius. Such an unbelievably unique and brilliant piece of musical theatre.
I will never miss my shot to experience this live in a theatre"
"839","Hamilton",9,"A Fantastic Musical Production","So I originally wasn't going to watch or review Hamilton, but this broadway production has taken over the world so I sat down with my mum and watched the 2 hour 40 film of the production and here is my review for it. The premise of the film shows the story of Alexander Hamilton the forgotten Founding Father starting from his humble beginnings all the way to his death.
Main Character
Lin-Manuel Miranda plays Hamilton here and he is superb. This man is really talented, not only did he star here but he wrote all the songs, his singing voice is really unique and really works here. He brings plenty of emotion to his role, I really cared about him and thought he gave a truly brilliant dramatic performance. But he also was pretty funny here with some good comedic lines, what was also great is that Hamilton is a really interesting character, he isn't this generic good guy, he has plenty of flaws and he is portrayed as a normal guy which helps the show.
Supporting Cast
I must stress everybody here is truly fantastic, even the background performers are great but here are the ones that stood out to me. Leslie Odom Jnr plays Aaron Burr the seemingly antagonist here and I thought this guy really shined, the fact his character is called Aaron like me has nothing to do with it. He has a great singing voice and again like Hamilton the character is really multi layered and a fascinating part of this production. Phillipa Soo plays Eliza Hamilton and I really saw her as the heart of this production, her relationship with Hamilton is well done and you come out of this film wanting to learn more about her and see the things that she achieved in her own right. Chris Jackson playing George Washington for me was a huge presence on the stage he was a larger then life character and he did a great job in the role. A special shoutout to Jonathan Grogg who plays King George, he isn't in the production much but he was a showstealer for me making me laugh the hardest here.
Story
The story is really interesting, we have all heard of George Washington and Thomas Jefferson but I am not sure too many have heard of Alexander Hamilton so it was great learning about this historical figure. I mean I am not sure exactly how much was accurate but it was a really interesting story, and with this being a musical using song to tell this story really worked. It made it more fun and enjoyable to study but also managed to make the dramatic scenes feel really impactful.
Script
Yes, pretty much all of the dialogue here is sung, which is impressive in its own right. But for me this was a really well written film. As mentioned above the drama really worked for me and the sprinkling of humour in there just made the story and characters even more interesting.
Style
The style of the way they filmed this production is fantastic, it feels truly epic in its production and the way it is presented. All the songs are fantastically performed and I loved the different styles of music that was here, there is a mix of rap, RNB and dramatic musical and the blend suprisingly works really well. But with this production this film is a bit long, and I get that it is a muscial so it should be long but I felt like I was pretty tired by the end of the film.
Overall
Overall, this is a truly fantastic production that all musical fans will love. But honestly, I think people who aren't a Musical fan can love it too, as I am not a Musical fan and I truly loved this film and would reccommend it to everybody."
"840","Hamilton",10,"I had to wait for It, but now I'm satisfied","No one throw away their shot and please watch Hamilton!"
"841","Hamilton",9,"Alexander Hamil-WIN!","This was an exciting thing for me. I, like most people, had heard of Hamilton. It was/is a HUGE phenomenon on Broadway and launched the careers of some incredible people. Miranda is always the fun, quirky, goofy musical wizard that pops up in shows now and then. Leslie Odom Jr. has always had this impishly wicked energy to him. Oh, and lets not forget Daveed Diggs, the up and comer who, after Blindspotting and a couple other things, I would watch in just about anything. Unfortunately, I live light years away from any decent stage so the odds of me seeing this in real life seemed like something that may just never happen. Enter the magical world of Disney and I am given the opportunity to finally experience the phenomenon myself, albeit not in the original form. Of course, with all the build up and all the hype, I was worried it couldn't possibly measure up.Now, to be perfectly honest, I knew next to nothing about this before watching it. I knew that Miranda created it, I knew Diggs was in it and I had some vague notion that it was about Alexander Hamilton, the founding father, and that it was a musical. I know that might seem like a lot and yet when this kicked off I felt completely blindsided by what I got. The music was catchy in a way I hadn't anticipated, to the point that I'm listening to the soundtrack right now as I write this out. The performances were full of life and energy and charisma, every character so wonderfully brought to life with Miranda and the performer's visions. Though, I have to say that Jonathan Groff as King George was an absolute scene stealer every second he was on stage.There are two magic tricks I think Hamilton not only pulls off, but pulls off effortlessly. First, the cast is remarkably diverse. This is never made into a ""thing"" or used as some tool to drive home some clumsy point in the way a lot of movies do, instead they're just people, people who do an exceptional job and I love that. I never once felt like a single person was miscast or not befitting their role and honestly, the fact that they never draw overt attention to it allows each actor to simply play their part exceptionally. Secondly, this draws attention to an imperfect man of great significance in American history that... Yeah, I'm sure I learned about him in school but honestly didn't know all that much about him. The fact that they essentially make something that's one part highly entertaining musical and another part educational and historical piece is wonderful.Negatives? I only really have one and it's sort've minor. There are a LOT of characters portrayed here and a lot of the actors play more than one role and it can be difficult at times to keep things straight. This is a fleeting issue, a few minutes after an actor steps into a new character and it's clear who they are, but there's that initial moment of 'Huh?' that can be briefly distracting. I get the feeling this is just a part of stage shows and I'm just the uncivilized dullard that doesn't know better but it is what it is.Now, as of me writing this, Hamilton is under fire and on the ever-growing cancel list. I don't agree with that. No, it doesn't focus on all of his faults, but Hamilton definitely doesn't portray Alexander as a saint by any means, not in my eyes. I think this absolutely worth watching and forming your own opinion on. Do the actions of the real man that died in 1804 mean that a 2020 musical can't be enjoyed? Can we judge the past with modern sensibilities? These are the deep, philosophical issues that this can bring out and I think these are discussions worth having. Personally, I separate the art from the inspiration and found this to be wildly entertaining. If you don't believe you are able or willing to do that, then your experience may vary wildly and that is perfectly alright by me."
"842","Hamilton",10,"Cause I'm helpless","I really did feel like I was in The Room Where It Happened. Even though the only flaw if I can call it that is some continuity errors like the ever changing flower. I've seen Hamilton in the U.S. tour and it was amazing but I missed a few minutes because I ran to the bathroom when it wasn't packed. I'm also poor so my daughter and I were in the mezzanine which binoculars came in handy <U+0001F923>
So, it's so amazing to feel up close and personal with the original cast. Jonathan Groff might want to work on that shower he spews or Broadway won't invite him back in the time of COVID"
"843","Hamilton",9,"Fantastic Choreography","I had always loved to listen to Hamilton with my family in long car rides and around the house, but seeing it was a whole new level of enjoyment.The Cinematography and the Choreography were what really made the show fantastic for me. I loved how many of the extras did the parts of stage crew within the dancing they had in specific songs.The entire play was authentic and original. The singing was not auto-tuned as so much of the music is today.Throughout this play/movie a wide range of emotions were conveyed as well. There was humor (especially with the King George songs), sadness (largely at the end of the showing) and triumph (winning the battle of Yorktown).The writing was genius in which the introductory melody was used with different words throughout the play, as well. The finale had a similar thing where many of the songs played a part and many different words were reused in a genius way. I loved this and would watch it again. I am sad that due to coronavirus this musical is not still being performed live, but would like to see it when possible.9.3/10 :)"
"844","Hamilton",9,"Just wow.","Yes, I was one of the poor folk who couldn't afford to see it in person... but to see the original cast in #hamilfilm is probably even better!! SO much talent represented here, but what struck me the most was Lin-Manuel's range of expression. What a talented human being."
"845","Hamilton",8,"Not better than the real thing...but close","I was fortunate enough to see Hamilton 3 times in Chicago, including once from the second row thanks to a friend winning the lottery. How did this compare? WAY better than I expected, honestly. I noticed new moments. I saw the original cast in a new light. I experienced the story like I was onstage. There's nothing quite like being in the theater, but this may be the closest a film crew ever got to capturing theater magic. (I wish the RENT movie had been a recording of a 1996 production...) Hamilton represents a unique moment in American theatre, and I'm grateful someone captured it."
"846","Hamilton",9,"I now like Musical Theatre!","Pros:Lin-Manuel Miranda... *Insert Clapping and Standing Ovation*. He was seemingly crafted this show and he has done a tremendous jobThe writing of the songs is fantastic and they are soooo catchySet design was brilliant and seeing this stage production through a camera was really enticing and left me wanting moreFunny in parts, sad in others. I felt 'Hamilton' had a great balancePerformances by everyone was fantastic... words don't do it justiceLafayette - HilariousConsNot many... But I did become a little confused with some plot points, that may have just been me thoughOverall, I thought 'Hamilton' was an absolute blast. The songs, performances were truly amazing and I will be listening to the soundtrack for a while now! Hats off to Lin-Manuel Miranda because he has crafted this from the ground and wrote the lyrics to the songs and the script. Honestly it is a fantastic achievement for him. I've never been a massive fan of musical theatre but 'Hamilton' has proved to me that there are some gems out there. I hope Disney or other companies release future productions on streaming sites because I can guarantee 'Hamilton' will be a wide success.Quote - ""I'm not throwing away my shot"" - Alexander HamiltonRating - 9/10"
"847","Hamilton",8,"Love It! Don't Spoil It!","I really do enjoy the Hamilton soundtrack and was so excited to actually view the performance! However, in a sense, I do think I have listened to the soundtrack too much to the point where I 'know' what happens too well. For watching the musical, I recommend not over-saturating oneself with other Hamilton media.All in all, it is an excellent musical with brilliant writing, excellent performances, and a memorable, multi-layered, story."
"848","Hamilton",8,"All Rise.","Like the rest of the world, I watched ""Hamilton"" on Disney Plus this weekend. Though I have seen a number of stage musicals, I haven't seen ""Hamilton"" yet, so this was my first opportunity to see the highly regarded show and I have to say that it didn't disappoint.Alexander Hamilton (Lin-Manuel Miranda) rises up from extremely humble beginnings to play a key role in the American War of Independence. His life sees him befriend, and then rival, Aaron Burr (Lesile Odom Jr) as both a military leader and then a statesman in the burgeoning country. He marries Eliza Schuyler (Phillipa Soo) but his infidelity proves to be the undoing of his reputation and the end of his progress.So I want to consider the show and the production separately, to give a fair appraisal.First the show. I really enjoyed it. I've always harboured concerns that the style of music might be too much of a deviation from established musicals, but really it isn't. I initially didn't think that any of the songs were as instantly memorable as some other musicals, but in fairness I've been humming bits from several of them since. The first half of the show focuses on his military career and the second as he serves under George Washington establishing financial systems and his family life. My only issue with the show was that several actors play two roles on either side of the interval and I wasn't totally clear that they had changed. There's no one actor that I could single out for special praise, because frankly, everyone is fantastic and it's gratifying to see so many of these particular cast taking Broadway and Hollywood roles.The production is great though. Single stage setting, with two turntables in the middle helping to keep things dynamic. There's a wide establishing shot, from a production with an audience present, that the reactions are taken from. This is cut with a series of closer shots from an onstage camera that must come from a series of audience free runs, which provide another level of depth and intimacy that is otherwise impossible. It's honestly the way that all stage performances need to be shot from now on.No recording is ever going to capture what it's like to see a show live, with a reacting audience but this is as close as we're likely to get and it's wonderful that this particular version has been memorialised forever."
"849","Hamilton",9,"It's great","The show itself is fantastic and it lives up to all the hype its been getting for five years. I've been listening to the music for years but I've never been able to afford going to the actual show so I'm really happy that it's more accessible now.The choreography is fantastic. All the dances are so seamless and the dancers are incredibly talented and skilled. The main cast members are all fantastic. Lin-Manuel Miranda is a perfect charismatic and witty Hamilton but the real star of the show in my opinion is Leslie Odom Jr. as Aaron Burr. His voice is so beautiful and he has amazing vocal range. I love all the music as I previously stated, but the performances add a lot of emotion and meaning to those songs.My only issue has nothing to do with the show itself and is more of a personal preference. I didn't like how they tried to replicate the Broadway experience. I just wanted to watch Hamilton but there's like an annoying laugh track since they filmed this with an audience. Overall, it's definitely worth a watch, even if the three hour run time scares you ."
"850","Hamilton",9,"The closest thing to the live experience","So thankful that there is a version of the beloved musical that is easily accessible to those who haven't seen it live."
"851","Hamilton",10,"Pure Perfection","Wow. I am at a loss for words. This is pure perfection. As a huge musical fan, it just doesn't get any better than this. I never had the chance to see the OBC live, so I have never experienced the acting, only the music. I was blown away by all the incredible perfomances, these perfomers are not only amazing singers, but some stunning actors as well.I just want to thank Lin-Manuel Miranda for bringing this incredible musical to the big screen. And now I am incredibly impatient for the movie adaptation of In the Heights. But I am willing to wait for it. I also want to thank all of the people involved in making this masterpiece. You all have a special place in my heart. Also shoutout to the women of Hamilton. Phillipa Soo, Renée Elise Goldsberry and Jasmine Cephas Jones you guys are awesome.If you haven't seen this musical or heard the songs, do yourselves a favor and watch it. You will not regret it. Now if you'll excuse me, I'll go watch this yet again and laugh and cry some more. I will probably do that for the foreseeable future."
"852","Hamilton",10,"How it should be done","There has been a lot of controversy regarding this release, especially with regards to the state of the world with COVID-19 still dominating, but this was so fantastic. I live in a small town in remote Australia. I bet you can guess how many times I have had the opportunity to see a Broadway show, but damn have I dreamed. While I completely understand that live stage shows have a magic that is near impossible to replicate, I NEED to thank Disney for trying.Lin-Manuel Miranda was incredible, and such a goofball. The sisters three were captivating. I couldn't take my eyes off of Renée especially. What a voice! And my dear Jonathan Groff, while his part was small, really deserves more recognition. I will forever be referencing his Groffsauce.When this is all over, dear reader, make sure you go out and support the live shows. Support the actors. The crew. The writers. The producers. The directors. This is such a hard time for anyone in the creative industry, but we need them. We need to help them get back on their feet for what is life without creativity?"
"853","Hamilton",10,"Beyond Amazing","I had to create an IMDb account so I could write this review. I never understood how people could say something like a movie or musical could change their life but I have to admit this is life-changing. When I first started listening to the soundtrack in late 2016, it was after Prince, David Bowie, Glenn Frey and others passed away. Hamilton was the bright spot in an otherwise yuck year. Then this movie comes out- oh my God. To see the original Broadway cast and such an amazing production- it's beyond anything I've ever seen before. It's not perfect, but that's what makes it great. If you're a fan of '90s rap, broadway show tunes, or history, then this is for you. If I could give it a higher rating than 10 I would. Awesome in the true sense of the word!"
"854","Hamilton",10,"Absolute perfection","There aren't many things I've ever rated a 10 on IMDB, but this is an exception. It is truly perfect. It is such a privilege to see the original cast perform this, something I never thought I'd be able to see, and to be able to rewatch at any time. The cast is phenomenal, Diggs, Soo and Groff especially. It makes capturing a complex stage musical look simple when it's anything but - I've never seen a filmed staging done so well, it genuinely captures the feel of attending a live performance but supplemented with just the right amount of close ups and aerial shots. I hope the success of this will encourage the filming of more shows in a similar way, as someone who's unlikely to get back to Broadway any time soon! I will be encouraging everyone I know to watch it."
"855","Hamilton",10,"We've been waiting and it delivered","Spotify will tell you that I've listened to the OST for Hamilton over 100 times. Like so many others it drew me in and wowed me with its catchy, clever and poignant lyrics and I was desperate to see the stage show. An incredible friend bought me tickets to go this year but due to covid it got cancelled, I along with thousands of others were devastated by this.
When I heard Disney were releasing this version it was like wedybeen given a second chance, not only to see the show, but the original cast! I've never been one to queue or refresh pages to get something first but at 8am UK time I was hitting play as soon as it appeared.And wow, what a show. I laughed, I cried, I want to watch it again and show everyone I know already.The songs I was already so familiar with felt new and exciting as each performance was so expertly choreographed to tell the story. With not much more than a single revolving stage piece I felt the action tangibly, Hurricane and The World Was Wide Enough were breathtaking.I know this phenomenon already has a huge fan base who will be watching this over the next few days but it's amazing that so many people who may not have had the opportunity to watch will now be able to."
"856","Hamilton",10,"Amazing","Good musical, I'm glad I was finally able to watch it since I never got a chance to do it before."
"857","Hamilton",10,"Perfection!","First off im a HUGE theater nerd im lucky to live in NYC (""the greaest city in the world"") and ive seen a pelothra of broadway shows. (obviously hamilton tops the list) When ive heard they were going to make a film of the live staging i couldnt wait till 2021 (thanks disney!) Ive seen the show live although not with its original cast and let me be the first to say THIS SHOW TOPS THE CURRENT BROADWAY VERSION. the production crew is flawless making us the viewer see emotions and angles you weren't able to see live besides the fact that the orignal cast KICKS any other form of hamilton. You see Lin manuel miranda and leslie odom jr's literal tears as they were acting! I honestly say that i enjoyed this filmed version of the show than the current broadway show. 10 stars!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
"858","Hamilton",10,"the musical of the year","Beautifully filmed, well crafted story structure and an amazing story with awe inspiring music, singing, dancing and acting. A must watch for everyone."
"859","Hamilton",10,"History is Cool","Anyone who has ever taught History or even studied it will tell you that the most common complaint that they get from people is that ""History is Boring.""But after you finish watching this beautifully filmed version of the acclaimed musical ""Hamilton,"" you will no longer be thinking that.History can be ""cool"" and educational at the same time.There are powerful lessons from the story of Alexander Hamilton that are more than relevant to today's world. But like so many other historical subjects, Hamilton feels disconnected from our world of today. He's another one of these ""old white guys"" that we have to read in a textbook, another one of those ""old white guys"" frozen onto a painting, a statue, or a dollar bill.But what ""Hamilton"" does so well is to take the essential elements of Alexander Hamilton and retell his story - including a number of lesser known characters - for a contemporary audience in ways that they can more easily connect to.There is of course also a political undercurrent, but instead of overshadowing the story, it helps underline its most timeless elements, whether it's race, gender, or wealth.Like many who have already posted reviews, I am not a huge fan of musicals, especially film adaptations of musicals, and especially historical musicals. Most of these tend to be soapy and shallow, full of stereotypes and inaccuracies that only hinder rather than aid the histories taught in books and/or the classroomBut not only does ""Hamilton"" avoid these traps, it manages to tell a beautiful and moving story that audiences from all backgrounds can connect to while remaining true to the essential history.And - most importantly - it's entertaining!History is Cool.Aloha<U+0001F60E><U+0001F919><U+0001F3FC>"
"860","Hamilton",10,"Hamilton","This is less a review and more so go and watch it right now I've listened to the soundtrack a lot of times and I still got the same reaction to it everytime and the show corsions is incredible the dance choreography is incredible like you look at satisfied and it's in reverse and it's just mind blowing don't even start talking about the music just watch it now"
"861","Hamilton",10,"Excellent adaptation and great acting","A mesmerising play. Excellent acting by everyone. Simple brilliant. It's a must watch. Wish I could see it live. Watching in a small screen does have it's advantages, I could see every expression clearly."
"862","Hamilton",10,"Worth the wait!","Like many I tried to get tickets for the ORIGINAL cast broadway show unsuccessfully. This was very well worth the wait, and bonus I don't have to take the train into the city."
"863","Hamilton",10,"Fabulous!","Never got around to seeing this in New York while it was on Broadway. How wonderful to be able to see it now, and more so with the original cast! Not to be missed."
"864","Hamilton",10,"Can not fault it","The first time I watched Hamilton I was speechless. It was educational, comical, emotional, captivating and all round just brilliant. The outstanding acting and delivery of cleverly-worded songs brought this part of history back to life. By far the best musical I've ever seen.
To anyone that struggles to be engaged by history text books or monotone documentaries, this is the perfect alternative. Or even to anyone that needs to escape from their own reality and be immersed in a world of pure brilliance. I now have the upmost respect for Lin-Manuel Miranda (the composer, lyricist, actor, singer, rapper, producer, and playwright of Hamilton) for his ability to put together such an astounding production."
"865","Hamilton",10,"Musical history","'Hamilton' was a major surprise for me when seeing and hearing it. Music is such a big part of my life, being now a semi-professional singer and raised into a musical family, and am a fan of musicals, especially the golden age ones. History was also one of my favourite and best subjects in most of my up and down school life, until it didn't work out in sixth form when my confidence went and my comprehension and drive worsened. So having a musical to combine the two immediately intrigued me, despite not being the biggest fan of the dominant styles here (was raised on classical music and opera personally).That is what was meant when saying that 'Hamilton' was a major surprise. Hearing that a filmed version of a production was coming to Disney+, which has been a much needed distraction, there was no doubt in my mind about seeing it. So that the mix of history and music, the meaningful and relevant lyrics, the brilliant performances and the energy and heart it has can be revisited again. It does play fast and loose with history, blame that on the musical and not the production, sure and the style(s) of music that dominates the score here are not my first choices usually, but actually for its entertainment value, emotional impact and how well crafted it is as an overall whole, 'Hamilton' was a real winner. As was this production. Which was very much needed after suffering through 'Artemis Fowl', a musical surprise adapted masterfully and so accessibly and through a particularly unsettling time in a terrible few years.It, the production that is, looks great. The sumptuous and true to the respective periods costumes especially and the setting is not too elaborate or overblown while still never looking cheap. Personally thought that the production was very well filmed, certainly compared to other filmed productions of musical theatre, opera and ballet seen and have seen many of each (being a major fan of all three). It made me feel like a member of an audience seeing it live, expect seeing it far more accessibly in terms of money and locations. Which is what is so great about these live/streamed performances and they have proven to be invaluable. Of which 'Hamilton' has been a big highlight.Musically, 'Hamilton' is on point. Those that don't like the styles are best staying away unless wanting to see what the hoopla is all about, but as someone that saw it with an open mind and wanting to stretch even more my musical horizons 'Hamilton' made me appreciate hip hop and rap much more because they were so well done in their own way. When they are well done and not too repetitive or preachy, yes it is dependent on how they're executed in my view rather than any bias towards the styles, that is when it is easy to appreciate them and that is what 'Hamilton' excels so well in. Also found it very well accompanied.What also comes over brilliantly is how 'Hamilton' is written. The musical and performance are very song heavy, which some may not like dependent on what your feelings on musicals, hip hop and rap are (some love it, others hate it and it is all down to taste which is fair enough). Found the melodies very clever and easy to remember, amazing considering how many there are and not an easy thing to achieve these days. It was the lyrics though that made a bigger impression on me, these lyrics were vastly entertaining and also at times quite emotional but what is just as admirable are their honesty and how relevant they are. These are lyrics that are likely to connect for many, and from the sounds of it have done. Historically, it is far and loose but that didn't matter for me being somebody that watched not expecting a history lesson. 'Hamilton' does very well at making people more interested in history and the particular time periods depicted, that is from my experience from seeing it with people that felt exactly the same as me. What is great about this production is how it does so well in being true and capturing the spirited energy and heart of the musical itself, which is what filmed adaptations of musicals in my mind should do.Really loved 'Hamilton's' performances. Have seen both love and hate for Lin Manuel Miranda's performance. Personally loved his work here, he was very heavily involved in making 'Hamilton' work, his dilligent efforts very much obvious here, and he gives the equivalent of the performance of his life here. He is charming and has great authority and comic timing and really do disagree that he doesn't have singing ability, he proved in 'Mary Poppins Returns' in my view that he could and he does great in this regard too. Dramatically he is the stuff of legends as is the joy that was Leslie Odom Jr. Daveed Diggs brings tremendous energy in Act 2 especially and Jonathan Groff is absolutely hilarious here. Phillipa Soo and Renee Elise Goldsberry shouldn't be overlooked either, Soo is especially good. Okieriete Onaodowan has great chemistry with Diggs and holds his own against him when they're together, especially as Madison.Concluding, truly brilliant in my view. It won't be for all tastes but even if one is put off by the first twenty minutes if not knowing what to expect my advice really is to stick with it. It is not worth certainly not bragging about turning it off about 15 minutes or something, that is the equivalent of barely seeing it. One of the easiest 10/10's given recently."
"866","Hamilton",10,"Perfection!","I live in Iran and I've been dying to watch Hamilton since its Broadway premiere back in 2015. I fell in love with a show that I couldn't have the opportunity to watch. But Tonight, after being able to witness this masterpiece I realized It is even far more sensational than I have ever imagined.
I have so many things to say but to save you some time I summarize it in few words:
""Pure definition of art"""
"867","Hamilton",10,"I hate musicals!!!!","And....I've watched this twice!! First without subtitles, 2nd with subtitles....lyrics were beautiful sung and clever, choreography and motions were artistically stellar....a work of art watched on tv! Next best thing to live! I see why now many have bought the album.....new timeless treasure! Singing and hip hop...not sure those who are not fans would be open to listen to the spoken words but, truly listen as poetic verses...writing is awesome!"
"868","Hamilton",8,"It's so good!!","Phillipa Soo KILLS IT!!!
OMG this is so good, this musical is amazing.
This is the first time watching the musical for me and I have to say: this is the best musical I have ever seen.Maybe you're wondering why I gave it an eight then, and to that I will just say that this is a review of the Disney+ version, and there are way too many different shots for a musical: when I see a musical in a theatre I view it from one point (my seat). This experience has zooms, and when you use film techniques on a theater show it loses a lot of its charm..But the show itself, ooh boy. It definitely is an experience. I cried so theres that, it takes a lot to make me cry bc I (usually) see straight through the parts where it's very made, but if it leads up to a moment and the singers kill it, that deserves respect."
"869","Hamilton",9,"A musical masterpiece","One of the greatest historical musicals ever made, the story, the outfits, the set, the score, the casting - everything absolutely perfect! Songs are incredible. Lin Manuel Miranda is remarkable in this, a living legend. You won't forget a musical like this."
"870","Hamilton",10,"Stunning!","I tried to get tickets for this when I was in NY and I was heartbroken that we couldn't get them so when I heard they were streaming it I was absolutely delighted!
I've watched pretty much every musical there is and I can tell you now this is spectacular! New, different, individual and beautifully written and performed I loved it.. and when the lock down lifts I'm prepared to watch it in every country in the world! Superb!!"
"871","Hamilton",9,"Truly at must watch for all the family","After seeing the show live on two occasions I could not wait for the Disney+ addition with the original cast, the thing that struck me is that in your living room on the TV you appreciate the characters so much more than you do live, as you get to absorb their emotions throughout and see their expressions in detail. The live show provides you with a lot more in terms of viewing, as the cast are constantly performing during the set which you don't get to see on Disney+ version (Camera focus on main characters within scene). I have to admit, when I was 1st introduced to Ham, I was not sure but I am now true fan. I recommend you listen to the soundtrack and then watch the performance, well done Lin & Co, you have captured many of us. May up it to 10 after I watch it a few more times <U+0001F61C>."
"872","Hamilton",10,"If history class was taught like this, I may have learned more","Never would I have ever thought that I would be watching a play about one of the founding fathers on repeat. I am so grateful this made it to the small screen for those of us who weren't able to catch the live show. Not only is just about every word sung, and beautifully at that, but the songs are done in styles to have you hanging on every word. It's the perfect amount of heavy and emotional with comedic lines and acts (thank you King George III). And while I am aware that the play does take some factual liberties, it had me googling to find out more about these people."
"873","Hamilton",10,"They're annoyingly talented","This was fantastic, it's not the same to sit on the sofa and watch a broadway musical... so I am so pleased releasing it made that possible. It was emotional, funny and heart wrenching. The music was superb. I'm in awe of how they remembered that many words. I watched with subtitles which really helped! Absolutely perfect score from me. Their talent is completely unrivalled."
"874","Hamilton",10,"LOVE LOVE LOVE","Miranda is a genius! 46.5 BANGERS!! not a single bad song!"
"875","Hamilton",10,"Gets better with each viewing!","I listened to the soundtrack, saw it live, and am now on my third viewing on Disney+... and it just keeps getting better! Genius."
"876","Hamilton",10,"Best thing I've watched in years","I went in blind, not really knowing anything about the musical or what it was about and was blown away. The difficulty level in the stage play was off the scale. Highly recommend"
"877","Hamilton",10,"Perfect","There's nothing bad to say about this. The direction it took was beautiful. The acting was phenomenal. A standout Leslie Odom Jr. performance. All done on one stage production. The songs and music were perfect. Lin Manuel-Miranda outdid himself."
"878","Hamilton",10,"what a treat","How incredible to be able to see this show on TV instead of going to New York and spending $800.After watching it, I wished I had seen it live. A production came to my home town and the last row in the balcony was the aforementioned $800.Anyway, this is a fantastic and memorable show, all the more important for maybe getting a few kids interested in a) historical characters; and b) Broadway/musical theater.The music is not my demographic, but there are many different styles, and I loved some of the songs. The lyrics were clever. I think Lin-Manuel Miranda is a genius.What I love is the originality, the expansiveness, the singing, the choreography, but most of all the incredible energy of the cast and story.For people who have no interest in seeing our forefathers dancing and singing, I say, watch it anyway. I wasn't interested either. It is fabulous."
"879","Hamilton",10,"Powerful, unique.","Broadway is a very exclusive place. There, acclaimed and historic plays are interpreted for some weeks and, most of the times, stay there. Rarely, they are filmed and distributed or interpreted to other publics. Hamilton came to change this, selling not the same experience of watching in the theater, but a very similar one. In the first minute, I was hypnotized. Since then, I didn't take my eyes from the screen. Is a charming film with two acts, one better than the other. The twist of the play is on the songs from GENIUS Lin Manuel Miranda, who wrote the lyrics and composed the melody. The score is a delicious blend of Hip-Hop, R&B and Jazz. Not happy with telling a story and creating songs that have a connection with which other, Miranda added a precise humor in the lyrics, in the right moments, that made me laugh a lot. Besides that, which is too much already, I will summarise other achievements: the costumes are out of this world; the lighting is accurate; the set, although simple and relatively small, is used with intelligence and creativity; the choreographies are fluid; is well filmed, capturing all the emotion and action; directed with a smart eye and performed by a great cast, flexible and competent. After using every adjective that I know, what I can say about Hamilton is that it is a valuable production. You can be sure that this movie is the start of a new trend in the cinema industry. Is a reason to congratulate the ones involved."
"880","Hamilton",10,"Hamilton Lives Up To The Hype!","A Broadway hit which became a pop icon and modern legend can finally be enjoyed from home! It does not disappoint for a second. The set pieces, choreography, lighting, editing, camerawork are just flawless and combined with the unforgettable songs and performances of the original cast they form an incredible viewing experience, transporting you into the heart of Broadway. A must see for all musical, theater and hip hop fans."
"881","Hamilton",10,"Genius","Lin-Miranda Manuel is a genius in our lifetime. The lyrics are so intelligent. The camera work is perfect. The choreography is masterfully artistic. And the talent... through the roof. I cannot say enough good things."
"882","Hamilton",10,"Powerful! Brilliant!","I didn't want it to end! The images, the music, the performances, the set, the lighting, the choreography the writing....all breathtaking and thought-provoking. The range of emotions the viewer experiences is exceptional. Bravo to all involved! Watch the extras, as it is fascinating to see how it came together, and the insights of the cast, writer, and director. Well worth the extra 33 minutes. History's eyes are on us all."
"883","Hamilton",10,"Hamilton is Superb","To have an opportunity to write and preform in the most highly acclaimed Broadway show since Gilbert and Sullivan. Sheds no comparison to the times it was written by a young Puerto Rican and preformed by such a talented cast of singers and dancers to be preformed while in office to our first black President and his First Lady and daughters. It goes without saying the storyline parallels Hamilton's actual achievements for such a young man as this young writer. Bravo all I can say is the stars aligned in this moment in time."
"884","Hamilton",10,"The best Broadway ever","This is it.... The best Broadway ever... Disney+ extremely genius.... Standing ovation at the end"
"885","Hamilton",10,"Just as amazing as I thought it would be!","Took me a full week to watch Hamilton but I loved every minute of it."
"886","Hamilton",10,"I finally know the story of Hamilton","An amazing story told with a musical twist that tells the life of Hamilton in a way that i will never forget."
"887","Hamilton",10,"Just great","Wish I could see this live. Absolutely amazing job by everyone."
"888","Hamilton",10,"Just sheer brilliance","As someone who has been obsessed with Hamilton ever since it came out, but had never gotten the opportunity to see it, this was exactly what I had hoped for. I felt like I was actually there watching the musical. The direction was perfect for the screen, and I am convinced that they should do this more often for other musicals. Hamilton will go down as one of the greatest broadway productions ever."
"889","Hamilton",10,"The Best Musical of All Time!","The title detailing this review is not written lightly. I've seen great musicals, animated and live-action, since I was a child. The Wizard of Oz, The Lion King, An American in Paris, Aladdin, The Sound of Music, Frozen, the list goes on and on but never have I been moved so much than with this powerful expression of art that NEEDS to be seen by all who can potentially see it.I am not often moved to genuine, personal tears after watching a movie or musical but this one got me. I cried while watching the musical but that was toward the story elements which managed to break me..and then I cried afterward with disbelief that I had seen a musical of this incredible scale starring men and women of color in a light that felt natural rather than forced or politically motivated.I've been waiting to see this musical for years and now, having got an up-close and personal 160 minute look at it, it deserves every award that it can get and if it can get more awards then darn it, give it to these wonderful people who brought this thing to life. The music, the choreography, the production, the sheer scope of brilliance poured into this musical is FANTASTIC and honestly one of the greatest things I have ever seen.I must also thank Disney and Disney+ for bringing this masterpiece into my life. Wow! Wow! Wow!"
"890","Hamilton",10,"Best Thing I've Ever Seen","Hamilton is patriotic, moving and simply a masterpiece. I watched it for the first time on 7/3. I've watched 3 more times since then and can't wait to watch it again. Every performance is gripping and full of emotion. I cried, laughed, sobbed and just felt everything. Thank you for making this! Highly recommend."
"891","Hamilton",10,"Well done!","Absolutely perfect. Pure enjoyment! Music is amazing."
"892","Hamilton",10,"Incredible","This is the first time I've ever written a review on here but Hamilton deserves it.
It's my favorite musical and I was lucky enough to watch it live on Broadway in october 2018 and it was absolutely amazing but now thanks to this I had the chance to watch it with the INCREDIBLE original cast.
I love how it's just a recording of the show. Best way to captivate what it's like to be in the room where it happens!"
"893","Hamilton",10,"The theatre in your livingroom","I've been a big fan of the soundtrack for years but have yet to get the chance to experience the show in person. However, this version was brilliantly directed and makes you feel like you're there. Fantastic performances all around and not only worth a watch but numerous rewatches as well."
"894","Hamilton",10,"OUTSTANDING!!!","Never been a fan of musicals nor had any desire to see a Broadway play. Think that may have changed after watching Hamilton today.Genius, from beginning to end!!! Well done, Lin-Manuel Miranda and cast.
<U+0001F44F><U+0001F44F><U+0001F44F>"
"895","Hamilton",10,"Epic and intimate","So I couldn't go see Hamilton in the theatre because of the lockdown and don't know when I will be able to. But this turned up on Disney+ and my head is still spinning by how incredible this production is. Lin-Manuel Miranda is a genius to have written this. Every performance in this story is flawless, engaging and emotive. The big moments are heart stopping and the intimate ones are heart breaking.My 8 year old son, who was engrossed in his Switch, stopped playing his video game and couldn't take his eyes of the screen within the first moments of ""Alexander Hamilton"". He said the songs were amazing.Hamilton lives up to all the hype and hyperbole, and then some. The best show I have watched since Les Miserables."
"896","Hamilton",10,"Captures the power of being in ""the room where it happens""","I'll just cut to the chase, the filmed version of the mega-hit stage musical HAMILTON (now streaming on Disney+) is terrific. If you are one of the few that have not seen this, check it out - you'll be glad you did.I could go on and on about the Pulitzer-Prize winning show, the script, the music, the performances and/or the cross-cultural casting - all of which works to perfection, but what separates this film from the other hit Broadway shows that are converted to film is how well that the filmmakers were able to translate the power of being inside the theater during a live performance of this show.Credit, of course, needs to go to the visionaries responsible for this show, creator/writer/star Lin-Manuel Miranda and Director Thomas Kail. They realized pretty early on (when the show was becoming the phenomenon that it has become) that they wanted to preserve this event for future generations, so started making plans to film the show - in High Def - with an audience and without an audience (for close-ups). In June 2016, about a month before the original cast started leaving the show (and right after the show won 11 Tony Awards), they spent $10 million to capture the show - with live audiences on Sunday and Tuesday and then spent the rest of Sunday night and all day Monday doing close-ups and crane shots to augment the action.The results are outstanding. The wide-shots show the breadth of the production - showing the strong, Tony Award winning choreography by Andy Blankenbuehler, the unique, minimal and highly versatile set, the Tony Award winning costumes by Paul Tazewell and the Lighting Design that earned Howell Blinkley a Tony. All of these are showcased in this film - special note should be made about the Lighting that needed to be tweaked on the spot for the filming.As for the close-ups, they showcase the wry smile and comedic delight that Tony winner Daveed Diggs shows in his roles as Lafayette/Jefferson, the power and sorrow of Tony Award winner Renee Elise Goldsberry - her spotlight number SATISFIED is as ""perfect"" a musical number as you will ever see. The powerful acting of Leslie Odom, Jr. as Aaron Burr (who won the Tony as Best Actor over Lin-Manuel's performance as Hamilton) as well as terrific supporting turns by the likes of Anthony Ramos (Lawrence/Phillip), Chris Jackson (showing real leadership as George Washington) and Okieriete Onaodwoan as Hercules Mulligan (one of my absolute favorite characters in this show)./James Madison.Special note should be made to Jonathan Groff's portrayal of King George III - it is, basically, a cameo role, but he is filmed with such tight close-ups (showing spittle rolling down has chin as he sings) that marvelously juxtaposes King George's real emotions with that of the words he is speaking.But, of course, the real star is Lin-Manuel Miranda - the genius creative force behind Hamilton. Interestingly enough, I thought his performance was the weakest of the lead cast (don't get me wrong, he was still excellent - just not ""as excellent"" as some of the others). His true vision, of course, was to tell the story of ""the people of that era"" as told by ""the people of our era"".That is the true genius of Hamilton.Letter Grade: A+10 stars out of 10 (can I turn this up to 11)?"
"897","Hamilton",10,"Will Always Love","I listened to the soundtrack millions of times and was still sooooooo excited to watch it. Truly amazing and breathtaking. Some people are saying that they didn't it like it because it was historically accurate(it was partly):Tell me you've a seen remake of a movie to another that hasn't changed a few things. People didn't like it because they don't like musicals: Then why did you watch a musical? People don't like it because people of color were playing people who were white:Lin-Manuel Miranda said it's the story of America then told by America now. People said they didn't like it because it was overrated: Ok, I guess I get it. People didn't it like because it was hip hop:It's literally a hip hop/rap musical. You hate the musical because you don't like hip hop.My opinion: Truly a breathtaking amazing wonderful masterpiece. The actors are amazing, vocals are amazing, costumes are A+, music is wow, camerawork is mediocre, and will watch it for years to come. Enjoy."
"898","Hamilton",10,"The original is the best there could be","I saw a bootleg tons of times, I saw the show in London and I could sing along to the entire cast recording from beginning to end but this... this is everything we needed. The filming was beautiful, added so much character and added a completely new layer to the show. Lin, Pippa, Renee, Leslie and the rest of the cast could not have been better. Top notch performance."
"899","Hamilton",10,"A magnificent production the hypes justified","I thought after all I've heard and read about this musical phenomenon that
July 4th would be an appropriate evening to judge for myself and I'm so pleased to say all the hype about Hamilton is true it is truly a fabulous stage show.
I could have seen Hamilton on our last trip to New York but two things put me off it's very expensive ticket cost and the gamble that I may not like it . Also I thought it would be an all wrap music show which is not my favourite musical genre but pleased to report the wrap lyrics are very clever and there are many other musical styles in this 2 hour 40 biographical musical.
Since then I've become a huge fan and admirer of Hamilton creator Lin-Manuel Miranda the new wunderkind of Broadway and Cinema .
Miranda has said that Hamilton reminded him of rapper Tupac Shakur, which is how he came up with the idea for a diverse hip hop musical about Hamilton's life. Miranda worked on ""Hamilton""- a project that people, including his mentor Stephen Sondheim, told him would never work.
Lin -Manuel Miranda based Hamilton the musical on an unlikely source: a dense, 818-page biography of Alexander Hamilton by the historian Ron Chernow many of his lyrics to the show are actually based directly on speeches from the book.
His first musical ""In the Heights "" had an Australian Premier and I saw it at the Sydney Opera House in 2019 and loved it as it reminded me of West Side Story. It also has a wrap hip hop score butlike Hamilton features other forms of theatre music like reggae traditional ballads and great orchestrations . Lin -Manuel has recently filmed ""In the Heights "" as a full feature movie to be released in 2021 and word on the street is it's a winner.
This version of Hamilton is a filmed version of the original multi eleven Tony Award winning musical directed by Thomas Kail the staging looks simple but it's a very complex and effective series of moveable multi tiered timber scaffolds that frame the stage for the large cast allowing plenty of space for the action and choreography to take place.
Whenever I see credits mentioning the same person has composed , written and is starring as well as an executive producer in their own show which is very rare I think they're either a genius, or just a complete egomaniac. In the case of Hamilton Lin- Manuel Miranda is a genius in every category and his masterwork Hamilton truly deserved the 11Tony Awards it won in 2016 just one short of the record breaking 12 Tonys for Mel Brooke's musical The Producers.
Hamilton was filmed across three days in 2016, a few weeks before the original cast finished their contracts.
The musical's original director, Thomas Kail, assembled a crack team of filmmakers, put them in front of the stage and lovingly captured the story the way it was intended to be: as a piece of theatre.
Nine cameras recorded two full performances before live audiences. Between shows, the makers refilmed the production to allow for angles that would be impossible for audiences to see within the theatre including close-ups of intimate and dramatic moments and sweeping overhead shots that capture the entire stage.
Hamilton the musical is set in the not so United States of America of 1776 to 1800 and there are definite comparisons to the Political situation in that country today.
The musical has been receiving rave critical reviews and sold out tickets to all productions in and outside the United States it broke box office records in London and Broadway is set to do the same in Sydney next year.
""Hamilton"" is the story of America then, told by America now. It features a score that blends hip-hop, jazz, R&B and Broadway, ""Hamilton"" has taken the story of American founding father Alexander Hamilton and created a revolutionary moment in theatre-a musical that has had a profound impact on culture, politics, and education.
It's no wonder John Bolton titled his recent book on President Donald Trump ""The Room Where it Happened "" the great song from Act 2 of "" Hamilton "" is titled The Room Where it Happens and takes place when Alexander Hamilton Americas first Secretary to the Treasury is ushered to a Secret Meeting where President Thomas Jefferson and his friend and future President James Maddison agree on an unprecedented compromise to move the Capital city of the new nation to their Southern electorate without consulting the American People or Aaron Burr who was the 3rd Vice President of the U.S.A.
The opening number ""Alexander Hamilton ""sets the show off beautifully sung by Lin-Manuel Miranda and the cast then leads to another great action song ""My Shot."" and a good example of the clever lyrics ""I am not throwing away my shot
I am not throwing away my shot
Hey yo, I'm just like my country
I'm young, scrappy and hungry
And I'm not throwing away my shot
The whole cast in this original Broadway Production are superb of course Lin -Manuel is wonderful as Alexander Hamilton but this is an ensemble piece .
The two Schuyler sisters Angelica Renee Louise Goldsberry and Eliza Phillipa Soo who becomes Eliza Hamilton Alexander's wife sing beautifully and look beautiful in their roles and costumes as does the whole cast by costume designer Paul Tazewell .
Some of the most sublime and more emotional moments of Hamilton feature these two talented women especially their first song in Act 1 titled The Schuyler Sisters.
The other major male roles Leslie Odam Jnr as Aaron Burr and Daveed Diggs as Marquis de Lafayette add to the drama and comedy of Hamilton and it's hard to imagine a better cast. Other great supporting roles that add so much to Hamilton are Chris Jackson as George Washington and a star turn by Jonathan Groff as King George 111 who has a great song and dance number "" You'll Be Back ""referring to America's separation from England.
I've often read that the American musical theatre has over the last one hundred years had 3 pivotal evolutions that have forever influenced the genre forever Jerome Kern's 1927 Showboat which for the first time progressed a dramatic story with a musical score that changed the art of musicals from comedy reviews or light weight romantic librettos .Then the next great change came in 1943 with Rodgers and Hammerstein's groundbreaking musical ""Oklahoma "" which was the first musical that raised the curtain on the solo character Curly singing ""Oh What a Beautiful Morning "" and developing from the earlier Show Boat, epitomising the development of the ""book musical"", a musical play where the songs and dances are fully integrated into a well-made story with serious dramatic goals that are able to evoke genuine emotions.
Then in 1957 ""West Side Story"" with the music of Leonard Bernstein and the spectacular Broadway debut Of Stephen Sondheim as lyricist bought gang warfare and a revolutionary contemporary song and instrumentally inventive orchestrations that have become classical milestones of many orchestra and Opera Houses the world . We will see a new film version next year directed by Stephen Spielberg.
Hamilton I predict will join these 3 famous musicals in history as a revolutionary and innovative game changer that will help keep the Broadway musical alive and thriving.
Is it worth $8.99 a month or $89.99 a year a Disney channel subscription? you'll have to judge that but it's the best seat in the house for a fraction of the cost of a ticket for Hamilton the musical. . I've noticed some great High School professional productions of various musicals and other movies and animated features on Disney so it's a yes for me and I'm not on commission .
I've added to my Christmas wish list a ticket to the Australian production of this great musical in Sydney next year at the Lyric Theatre.
Composers that have the talent to star in their own musicals are less than a dozen and Lin - Manuel has written and starred in two Washington Heights and Hamilton.
Disney Plus Channel paid $75 million for the screening rights for Hamilton and the franchise rights which will create huge dividends for Disney now and into the future.
Lin -Manuel reportedly made $ 6.4 million off Hamilton in 2017 alone before this Disney deal. He is a modest multi millionaires owning two luxury pre-war apartments in Upper Manhattan, but otherwise lives a relatively modest lifestyle and still rides the subway. The latest estimate of his net wealth after the Disney deal is $80 million .
Broadway made Lin-Manuel Miranda a star, but philanthropy-from disaster relief in Puerto Rico to arts education at home in New York-is truly the family business.
This filmed production of a stage musical is definitely the best I've ever seen and I really can't wait to see what our Australian production is like next year."
"900","Hamilton",10,"influential, imposing, and moving","I was enraptured by the music, the performance, and the milieu, which quite beautifully captured the life of Alexander Hamilton, portraying his dramatic life events. The acting is top-notch. Finally, It transcended my minds up above the sky. Broadway knocked it out of the park."
"901","Eurovision Song Contest: The Story of Fire Saga",10,"Made a burly old icelander weep and laugh!","This is one of the very few times I have felt such emotions while watching a movie. Me and my gf cried a few times and laughed a lot. Many people ""not Icelanders"" criticise this movie saying that it's embarrassing for Icelanders and make us look stupid. Well to tell you the truth they got us in my mind pretty accurately. Made a frickin account just to write this. Thanks from iceland and have a good one."
"902","Eurovision Song Contest: The Story of Fire Saga",10,"Thank you from Iceland","Thank you Will Farell. We did not get a song contest this year but you gave us the best Eurovision I have ever seen! As an elf loving Icelanders I loved the silly humor and the end song brought me to tears. Rachel was adorable as ever."
"903","Eurovision Song Contest: The Story of Fire Saga",9,"Couldn't stop smiling at the happy madness of it all","Admit I'm not a Will Ferrell fan at all, his movies are all about him, but in this movie, Rachel Adams and Dan Stevens are a revelation of singing and comic talent. SO many great faces from the Eurovision Song Contest as well as cast members from the Witcher, The Norsemen etc. I realised by the time of the Eurovision party singalong that I was laughing out loud. The costumes, the dancing, are all insanely inspired. And as an Edinburgh native, thank you for filming here in Edinburgh! As I frequently direct Americans to the nearest Starbucks, thanks for the laugh out loud asides. Now time to put on my Icelandic elf slippers from my second favourite country in the world, and watch it again."
"904","Eurovision Song Contest: The Story of Fire Saga",9,"Just the distraction I needed during a pandemic","I had my doubts about this movie, but decided to watch it based on the cast. So glad I did. It made me smile, tap my foot and just escape a little to a happy place during a terrible time in the world.Is it the most deftly acted, written and produced movie...no, no Oscar nominations, I'm pretty sure. But that's not the point.What it does offer to the audience is a bit of fun and escapism, and a bunch of good laughs and cringe-worthy moments. It also left me a little lighter in spirit, and It reminded me to take the world less seriously. This was just what I needed during a pandemic, rampant racism, a horrible government and climate change out of control. There's so much that is wrong, that a little right is helpful. While I can't control the crazy world, I can control what I watch and how it impacts me. I choose to enjoy it for what it is and smile."

So does every chocolate bar get a 1 star if you don't like chocolate?
This movie isn't a gripping drama. It's not edgy or groundbreaking.
It's cute, and it's fun.
It's definitely not for everyone. Expect some classic feel goods. Expect to immediately YouTube the main songs to hear them again. Expect Will Ferrell. Expect to fall in love with Rachell McAdams and silver lip gloss. Don't expect unforseeable twists.
It's ""hallmark"" meets ""pitch perfect"" meets ""elf"".Thanks Netflix and those who made this film for some feel goods in the middle of a globally not chipper time.
To you 1 star critics, take your negativity back to your comment threads and let us have a moment of Joy.Please and thank you"
"907","Eurovision Song Contest: The Story of Fire Saga",8,"Honestly, better than I expected","My expectations were low, I love Will Ferrel but his movies are often shallow and stupid and rarely touches you. This one is not deep and smart, that is not what I'm saying! But it is well made and has a lot of heart in it that balances the shallow and stupid quite good. Add on top of that the end performance by Rachel McAdams, the sweetest actress in all of Hollywood, and you suddenly find yourself cheering for a fictional Icelandic band in a fictional Eurovision contest in this feel good movie of crazy corona summer of 2020. Well done! Well done indeed!"
"908","Eurovision Song Contest: The Story of Fire Saga",10,"A movie that pays tribute to Iceland and Eurovision","Iceland is a small and isolated country in the middle of the Atlantic and we the Icelandic people have many traditions that may seem strange to other people.For this reason I find that we Icelanders are many times made fun of in pop culture. We eat shark that is nasty höhö. So tired of this guys seriously.This movie does not make fun of Iceland it pays tribute to Iceland. It uses many famous Icelandic actors and there are loads of small references to Icelandic things that only people how have been to Iceland would pick up on.A part from all that the movie is great. Will Ferrel is hilarious, Rachel McAdams is hilarious. The Jaja Ding dong guy is hilarious. Hearing Pierce Brosnan try and talk Icelandic is hilarious.10/10 No problem. Must watch!"
"909","Eurovision Song Contest: The Story of Fire Saga",10,"As a proud Eurovision lover this film is everything!","I love Eurovision! I have no shame about this! Every year we have a get together with drinks and food and scoresheets and have the best night! This year everything changed, there was no get together, no singing our favourite songs, no voting and it was so so so missed!Tonight me and my sister thought let's give this a go, it will be a laugh. Well we were given Eurovision life! It was everything that we love about eurovision! The songs, the cheesiness, the love! Watch the film, enjoy it like a weekend of eurovision and don't take it seriously!The storyline is cute, its not forced it just flows and even if the length of the film feels long to you, you may not be a fan of eurovision (that show is long!!). I didn't want it to end and some of those songs are pure euro classics!! I have to say as a UK native we haven't won in a long long time so the only implausible part of the film is that it is in the UK and the hosts are not British but apart from that I will be watching this film anytime I feel sad as it has made my evening and made up the fact that eurovison was cancelled this year!Enjoy the film and don't take it seriously because Eurovision is just fun and meant to be enjoyed!!"
"910","Eurovision Song Contest: The Story of Fire Saga",9,"Ignore the critic reviews, funny and nostalgic throughout!","I ignored the reviews online but my Missus wasn't so sure (as clearly had). Pleased to have watched this in a year so far that has hardly brought much laughter on the film front, plus given Eurovision was cancelled this year!Don't worry about the plot too much, and leave your negativities at the door, this is a laugh a minute along with some good acting from McAdams and Ferrell not always stealing the limelight with normal roles.Great humour and very entertaining! Pure Eurovision (ignore its in Edinburgh and the hosts aren't, plus Pierce Brosnans welsh...sorry, Icelandic accent)Recommend"
"911","Eurovision Song Contest: The Story of Fire Saga",8,"Surprisingly Good","This is worth watching just for Dan Stevens's portrayal of the Russian entrant, Alexander - brilliant acting and worthy of an award. Iceland's Final song is fantastic and I've already saved it in my Spotify playlist - another reason to watch the movie. One of the best lines in the movie for me was about elves taking things too far... had me & my friend in stitches."
"912","Eurovision Song Contest: The Story of Fire Saga",9,"12 points from France !","I loved it! Because it hits a high sensible part about home, dreams and meaning of our actions.

"913","Eurovision Song Contest: The Story of Fire Saga",8,"I found myself tearing up over a film that (on the surface) seemed rather average...","I think when people see Will Ferrell on the casting list, they immediately think that it's going to be a laugh out loud movie, which I myself fell victim for. The film wasnt as funny as I had thought it would be, but instead found myself in tears at the end of the film. This is because this movie PERFECTLY represents what Eurovison is about, a proud cultural phenomenon that strives in diversity and community. This is a MUST SEE movie. The final song is beautiful, and the characters that are developed on screen become more lovable by the end of the film. There were also a few cameos too, of course there were going to be cameos! If you love Eurovision, you will fall in love with this!"
"914","Eurovision Song Contest: The Story of Fire Saga",8,"Won our hearts","I'm not a big fan of Eurovision Song Contest, but as a Swede I'm very familiar with it. The movie was actually really good and I watched the whole movie in one go in the middle of the night! It's full with warmth and Joy without it ever being cheesy. Absolutly loved it!"
"915","Eurovision Song Contest: The Story of Fire Saga",10,"A Nordic Triumph","I'm an American who's been living in Europe for 15 years and had never heard of Eurovision before moving here. I now watch it each year and think it's hilariously kitschy, spectacular, and, every now and then, there's even a great song. This film brilliantly captures all of those elements of Eurovision in a film that's both extremely funny and moving. The song ""Husavik"" is genuinely great and there are some other fabulous musical moments as well, such as the ""songalong"". I suspect that most of the bad ratings come from Americans who've never seen Eurovision before and probably haven't ever been to the Nordic countries, so don't have a sense of what's funny about the characterizations of both. I don't say that with arrogance - I also didn't know before I moved here! In any case, I hope Americans will give this gem of a film a chance. It was clearly made with love and Will Ferrell took a risk making a film about a country he must have known most Americans have no interest in. Probably the most fun I've had watching a film this year, and I watch a lot. . ."
"916","Eurovision Song Contest: The Story of Fire Saga",9,"Exceeded Expectations","When I saw over two hours long for a comedy like this I was expecting to give up after 10 minutes but this came together surprisingly well, well put together, some unexpected laughs. The 2 hours actually flew by. You may have to love Eurovision, as I do, to really like it and 'get' parts of it. It also felt like a good Eurovision fix in a Eurovision- free year."
"917","Eurovision Song Contest: The Story of Fire Saga",9,"McAdams shines in this good natured Will Ferrell Comedy","This is one of Will Ferrells better comedies since Step Brothers. For me it goes number 5 behind Step Brothers, Talledega Nights, Anchorman, and Old School. And Rachel McAdams lights up the screen every she appears. A lot of funny moments including the magical elve joke and fun goofy music set pieces. Even my wife who isn't a Ferrell fan enjoyed this movie. Don't dismiss this film."
"918","Eurovision Song Contest: The Story of Fire Saga",10,"Wonderful, uplifting and such a relief from our odd world","I wasn't expecting much from this but was thoroughly overjoyed to be proved wrong. It captured the essence of Eurovision perfectly and it was lovely to see previous entrants have cameos. I've been to Iceland 3 times, but have never visited Husavik. I definitely will next time."

He managed to capture the essence of Eurovision in this wonderful comedy. I laughed all the way. Thankyou Will for another witty, hilarious repasse."
"923","Eurovision Song Contest: The Story of Fire Saga",9,"Silly, campy, goofy, feel good movie!","Firstly, anyone rating this film less than a 7 just doesn't get what Eurovision is all about.
The movie is a silly, campy, goofy, feel good experience, exactly like the song contest.It's not perfect, but it's great fun. The story is fairly obvious, but Will Ferrell has fun playing his usual goofy character, and Rachel McAdams and Dan Stevens provide great support.The only award this movie might get a nomination for is the original songs, which hit all of the right Eurovision notes. The song writers have done a great job in capturing the essence of Eurovision.Overall, don't take it seriously, and its very enjoyable.
Loved the ending too, very emotional!"
"924","Eurovision Song Contest: The Story of Fire Saga",9,"As a European......","The storyline is not very ""in depth"" but a good ""coathanger"" to get the americans and other non european countries to learn a bit more about this crazy, weird but very popular Eurovision Song Contest. The songs in it are of a very high quality and it gives a good impression of what its really like. Also the visuals and stage performances are very realistic. I found it very enjoyable. Also a tip for the people who are new to this: there are a lot of original former contestants in hit. Also the commentator for the contest Graham Norton is in it. Just enjoy it for what it is! It's not a mainstream production but in fact a quite original one."
"925","Eurovision Song Contest: The Story of Fire Saga",8,"""Blades of Glory"" meets ""Pitch Perfect""","Full of laughs, love, music, and happiness; this is a wonderfully entertaining movie! With Rom-Com styling, the movie is a ton of fun. It's an enjoyable satire, drawing awareness to a production that most North Americans are unfamiliar with. If you're like me, it may even bring a tear to your eye! Based on the lesser reviews, I guess some people expected an experience similar to ""Schindler's list."" This isn't that, nor is it trying to be. For those who simply want to kill two hours, this is definitely worth your time. Great job, Netflix!"
"926","Eurovision Song Contest: The Story of Fire Saga",10,"Instantly a Eurovision classic - is it too soon to watch again?","As a huge Eurovision fan, this movie was everything I hoped it would be and more! The songs are so Eurovision and would be believable as genuine entries to the real contest. The song Husavik gives me goosebumps every time I listen.The humour was funny and silly but the film has so much heart as well which really surprised me. I'm not sure if you have to be a true Eurovision fan to really feel that this film does go deeper than what's on the surface. We didn't get a contest this year, this more than makes up for it, but we did get a special on the BBC (and across the world!) where the hosts were virtually speaking to this years entries and past contestants. This programmme really moved me and it was really heartwarming to see Europe come together through this crisis, and this film gave me the same feeling knowing Eurovision fans all around the world would most likely be checking this movie out as a replacement for a show this year. If there was a perfect time for this film, it's now!The only thing missing in the film was the postcards!! They could have done something so cool with these so I wish they'd been included but either way it's still a 10/10 from me!The low scores really baffle me, you have to take this film for what it is. You're not sitting down to Once Upon a Time in Hollywood, this is some lighthearted, heartwarming fun. I think you might have to be a boring or very serious person not to enjoy this or at least crack a smile....sorry...Thank you so much Will Ferrell!!!"
"927","Eurovision Song Contest: The Story of Fire Saga",8,"The best Eurovision event this year.","..and probably would have been even if they had had a real show this year.
For me that has watched the eurovision since I was small this was an emotional roller coaster ride. The movie is not a comedy as such, even if there are more than a handful of laughs and giggles. It is more of a feelgood drama with comedic and goofy undertones. In fact I think a lot of the movie manages to hit the goofy tone of much of the Eurovision. It parodies a lot pf Eurovision song contest, which is probably lost on a casual or someone who never watched the ESC show. Payback to the americans when we had to watch otherwise good movies against backdrops of hard to enjoy or understand stuff like american football, basketball or (snore) baseball. But as well as goofiness, there are also deeply romantic and sad parts. The music, for the most part, is excellent, better than the average ESC fare.
Good efforts from Will, Rachel and Pierce Brosnan who is great as the stern and sane father.
Bad is a stretch in the middle of the movie and any mention of p----. Why is that even there?
Ohh, and this movie makes me want to go to Iceland right now. Was there for 4 days last year and it was great, beautiful country despite having few trees and friendly people.
Ps2. There was a phone voting in my country for the ESC contestants despite there not being a big contest, and Iceland won. Iceland for the win!"
"928","Eurovision Song Contest: The Story of Fire Saga",10,"It takes an American to know ESC","What a great funny crazy film about Eurovision Song Contest! I'm from Sweden and Will Ferrell really nailed it! It doesn't get more Europe than this. A long time since a laughed that much."
"929","Eurovision Song Contest: The Story of Fire Saga",10,"Super sweet and a feel-good movie all around","I've watched it several times now. They were the cutest couple of people I've ever seen! Super adorable. It was funny as well but I think it is more of a feel-good movie than a straight up comedy. I was surprised with the low rating because everyone I talked to about the movie said they loved it.I'm familiar with the Eurovision contest and I'm not really a fan but I was worried that this movie would be making fun of it. It is a well loved competition in Europe so I thought it would be pretty rude to insult all of Europe. But I thought it was pretty accurate and was in good taste."
"930","Eurovision Song Contest: The Story of Fire Saga",10,"Puts you in an awesome mood!","What did i just watch?! I LOVED IT! I really expected it to be kind of dumb,which it is in its own way, but you can't help but enjoy it from the beginning to end.Such a feel good movie!"
"931","Eurovision Song Contest: The Story of Fire Saga",8,"This is exactly what you would expect from Will Ferrell...and much more.","I was not sure about this movie during the first ten minutes. You really need to be in the mood to watch Will Ferrell's movies. But as the story develops and Rachel McAdams starts to shine and the music plays, it quickly becomes a very watchable movie that ends actually pretty good. If you have watched Eurovision before you may understand some of the jokes better, but even if you never heard of it before you can still enjoy this movie a lot. Just don't expect an amazing plot and and great script, it's a silly uplifting comedy with the characteristic weirdness and over the top jokes by Ferrell. The cinematography is good, the music and performances, particularly by Rachel McAdams, is excellent. Watch it with an open mind and an open heart. This is a movie to forget for two hours about the stream of recent bad news everywhere."

How wrong was I. This turned out to be a great feel good movie. This is not going to go home with many Oscar awards but that was never the purpose I assume. Spot on Netflix. Will, Rachel and co. Perhaps when Iceland wins Eurovision we will get a sequel."
"936","Eurovision Song Contest: The Story of Fire Saga",10,"Better than I thought","What a treat for Eurovision fans. Will Ferrell and Rachel McAdams work so well together. The music is typical of Eurovision and the song Husavik is perfect."
"937","Eurovision Song Contest: The Story of Fire Saga",10,"GREAT!!!","As a European living in America I don't understand why people are surprised that the US made a movie about Eurovision. The US makes movies primarily for an american audience. Of course they'll make this. They have the money, the skills, and the experience to pull this off and THEY SURE DID!! This movie had it all. The songs were actually SO GOOD! The singing was amazing. The story was obviously nothing original. But it's like eating your favorite ice cream. You've had it a million times and it still tastes great!And to all the 1 star reviewers - you must seek help immediately because you clearly need a reality check. Do you check into an Economy Inn and expect the Ritz Carlton too?? What is wrong with you?! The movie is entertaining, quite funny, very light, and just overall fun. If you expected some life changing, never-seen-before comedy, then you are crazy."
"938","Eurovision Song Contest: The Story of Fire Saga",9,"Very far better than I expected","Will Ferrell is the only comedian capable of repeating the same character (a selfish middle age naive man with Peter Pan syndrome who grows up by the end ) and still able to get the public sympathy. His charisma is out of this world for sure.
His movies as cliche as they are always carry some surprise and this is not exception. You pretty much knows where it goes but still hook you up gladly.
This time Ferrell who is also a writer throw darts to politics, small town absurdities (and believe as funny as they seem are most of them real) and parents disdain about sons.
On the other hand, he increases Rachel McAdams performance who is lovable heere and with voice so angelic it will surprise you for good.
There are many good jokes and others failed but the general tone is highly positive and worth your time.
In brief; a good laugh is always necessary."
"939","Eurovision Song Contest: The Story of Fire Saga",10,"This was hilarious","The chemistry between Will and Rachel is amazing. The jokes were hilarious. There's a part in this moving that made me pause and almost die from laughing so hard, my wife had to video record me because I rarely laugh so hard. The soundtrack was so corny and yet amazing at the same time. They do great justice for Iceland as well. Real Icelandic bands are used for the soundtrack. It was a joy from the very moment it started."
"940","Eurovision Song Contest: The Story of Fire Saga",10,"How Eurovision 2020 Should've Played Out","I simply can't understand all the poor reviews and scores of 5 or less that this film is getting. It's simply a fun, unpretentious & light hearted look at the Eurovision competition. I mean seriously people......Let me qualify my comments....my first ever review and it's for a Will Ferrell movie haha..I'm a movie buff who has enjoyed cinema for 40 odd years, and this was simply a great enjoyable easy ride, that was not meant to be taken as seriously as others have obviously done...I honestly had minimal expectations for what I was about to watch, but Ferrell and McAdams' 1st foray into the musical genre had me pleasantly surprised - in fact I absolutely loved it.
Although Eurovision Fire Saga doesn't take itself too seriously, it still delivers a very good solid storyline, a strong underlying message about life and love and topped off with a fantastic sound track that will have you blaring the speakers at all hours on repeat.....For those who enjoy Eurovision, for those who enjoy some great catchy music and for anyone that enjoys barracking for the underdogs then this is the film for you.
Its so good, I hope they make a sequel...."
"941","Eurovision Song Contest: The Story of Fire Saga",8,"It's a good movie. Period","It's funny. It's sad. It's predictable. It's surprising. It makes fun of Eurovision. It's beautiful. It has Rachel McAdams, who just makes every film she is in at least 10x better.It is a good, entertaining movie."
"942","Eurovision Song Contest: The Story of Fire Saga",9,"Very funny, Ferrell and McAdams were excellent","As someone who is married to a Eurovision fanatic, I dread the annual debacle. So this very funny take on Eurovision is a breath of fresh air. Ferrel and McAdams are excellent. Hilarious!"
"943","Eurovision Song Contest: The Story of Fire Saga",10,"Captures in an odd way the feeling of Icelandic connection to Eurovision","It was a great movie for an Icelandic to watch... captures some feeling and insight to Eurovision and our passion for Eurovision. Really fun movie to watch... great job Ferrel and co."
"944","Eurovision Song Contest: The Story of Fire Saga",9,"Great Representation of Eurovision","If this movie came out any other time before this Pandemic, I'm not sure if it would have been so well received or appreciated as much. In America, at least I am, we are looking for an escape to all the horrible news everyday. We also have extra time on our hands to appreciate and research other cultures. I had no knowledge of Eurovision Song Contest and what a big deal it is in Europe. They have their share of talented singers and some that would only be appreciated in Europe. But a Big thank you to Will Farrell, Rachel McAdams for educating us on this part of European culture and giving us a little escapism. And some of the songs are very catchy too. Hope to sing ""JaJa Ding dong""""at the next Beer Garden or Octoberfest!! Just watch it and give it a chance!"

"946","Eurovision Song Contest: The Story of Fire Saga",8,"The best Eurovision that I have ever seen","This movie was a complete surprise. Netflix does not make really good movies. For some reason they are always lack something extra (take all of Adam Sandler movies of late) or straight awful like""Coffee and Kareem"". This time it's different. It's actually surprisingly emotional and simply awesome movie, with an amazing cast. This is one of the best I've seen from Will Ferrell in a long time, probably since Anchorman 2.
This movie is a creation of Ferrell, as he's the one who co-wrote, produced and starred in it, so the credit goes to him. The funny part is, that it felt that he was a bit of mismatch looks-wise, for simply amazing Rachel McAdams.
The music is perfect reflection of Eurovision. It lifts the spirit and makes you smile.
I would hope the'd make a followup to this one with a Rocky1 - Rocky 2 style, where the Iceland would win. I never really rooted for anyone at Eurovision, but the next time I'll be rooting for Iceland."
"947","Eurovision Song Contest: The Story of Fire Saga",10,"Great film. Good chemistry. Amazing music","I loved this film so much i have watched it twice in 2 days. The accents are spot on. Im really hoping they release the music from the film."
"948","Eurovision Song Contest: The Story of Fire Saga",9,"Hilarious and endearing","This is such a funny film which really catches the essence of Eurovision. Entwined in this is a beautiful story of love and belief. Especially brilliant were Dan Stevens and Rachel McAdams. For us , Dan is the highlight as Alexander Lemtov. As Will Ferrell is in the film, I had expected it to be another Blades of Glory. It isn't. However, for me he is too old for the role and could have been Sigrit's father! He was still entertaining, but his part could have been played by someone else."
"949","Eurovision Song Contest: The Story of Fire Saga",10,"Absolutely and utterly fantastic","This movie is just fabulous. Where to start?
You wouldn't think that a Canadian (McAdams) and an American (Ferrell) could pull off Icelanders well, but they did it to perfection. The story was both hilarious and moving, just an overall fun movie that has you smiling all the way through. The songs and its vocals are a spectacle as well. Some fantastic vocals put together by a plethora of artists who looked like they enjoyed every second of filming this movie. I think I've listened to the songs Double Trouble and Husavik a million times in the 24 hours since this movie came out!!!
Would highly recommend for all age categories except maybe not really young children because the movie does not directly show, but implies some very gruesome deaths (although they're hilarious) with a comedic take!."
"950","Eurovision Song Contest: The Story of Fire Saga",8,"PLAY JA JA DING DONG!","This silly movie sneakily becomes deeper and deeper until it reaches a climactic ending that is actually one of the most powerful movie moments I've ever witnessed about community and taking pride in others. The final song absolutely brought me to tears.One of the paramount accomplishments in Will Ferrell's career how he gradually hands over the prominence to McAdams as the film progresses, as well as writing a genuinely interesting antagonist (don't want to say more and spoil it) in Dan Stevens. Amazing cast, and the music is unbelievably good.But what do I know, I'm an American so I'll just go now. To Starbucks."
"951","Eurovision Song Contest: The Story of Fire Saga",10,"Hollywood Eurovision","Loved this film, captured the essence, the excentricity and the passion of Eurovision. Volcano Man for me would be 12 points every day."
"952","Eurovision Song Contest: The Story of Fire Saga",10,"Its deep comedy","This is an excellent comedy and feel good musical kind movie. But the jokes are deep-level comedy and if you know the crazy Eurovision you will love it"
"953","Eurovision Song Contest: The Story of Fire Saga",10,"Best comedy this year!","First of all this is a European comedy. I get it that the American press doesn't get it. But Eurovision has been the biggest contest in the EU for 30 years. And this was the best interpretation of EV you can get. Most of the winners were in this movie and the actors just nailed it! I haven't laughed this much in a long time. This is a tribute to Eurovision. Please give us a sequel!"
"954","Eurovision Song Contest: The Story of Fire Saga",10,"Good movie","Okay the middle one hour of tge movie could have been shortened to half that time but I was in no hurry watching this so it did not matter. I give it a ten because this movie could sustain my attention during its entire length, there are several memorable jokes in it, and I like both main actors, Ferrell and McAdams who never disappoint. Regarding who sings what, I listened to Swedish singer Molly Sanden and I prefer McAdams voice (if you pay attention you can hear when she is the one singing). I had a good time, I got entertained, this is all I ask from a movie, thus a ten. I must add a sidenote regarding Eurovision. It is well known that countries do not send their best over there with the true intention to avoid having to pay for the cost of hosting the show. This is not something made up for the movie, unfortunately. Also, this is a good surprise from Netflix as I typically enjoy their series but not their movies that I usually find dull."
"955","Eurovision Song Contest: The Story of Fire Saga",10,"For Eurovision fans","I will be shortFor anyone not familiar with Eurovision this will be a very average movieFor anyone loving Eurovision this is a must see"
"956","Eurovision Song Contest: The Story of Fire Saga",9,"THANKS TO WILL FERRELL'S SWEDISH WIFE WHO INTRODUCED HIM TO THE EUROVISION SONG CONTEST:)","Beyond my expectations, it's a wonderful film which truly reflected the enthusiasm and passion of the Eurovision audiences, who were excited by the spirit of competition throughout the Europe, days even months before the final day.I can say that it is a very nostalgic movie; it took me all the way to my childhood memories. Absurd dance choreographies, interesting, exaggerated costumes, the firm belief that the contestants must perform their songs in English in order to win, but nevertheless, they salute their fellow citizens by sprinkling few words into the lyrics in their native languages while singing their songs... These are all the details that you can capture if you are familiar with Eurovision Song Contest. Clearly Will Ferrell did his job very well and he did extensive research before even he shot the movie.Will Ferrell is always a good comedian and has shown it in his previous work however the biggest surprise for me was that Rachel McAdams' acting performance was superb in a comedy genre and the two were a great duo.I loved the side characters as well like the decent, self-adoring and possibly gay Russian guy (even though there isn't any homosexuality in Russia!?!), loving and caring Icelanders, good hearted naïve American tourists etc.In these pessimistic depressive pandemic days I am glad that I watched this film. It made my day!"
"957","Eurovision Song Contest: The Story of Fire Saga",10,"10/10","Really enjoyable movie. i went through many emotions watching it. and as we didnt get the eurovision this year, the movie came in perfect time."
"958","Eurovision Song Contest: The Story of Fire Saga",7,"Doesn't take itself too seriously","I expected to HATE this movie and almost turned it off after 10 minutes, but so glad I didn't! This movie is filled with stereotypes, which was a little distracting in the beginning. Isn't this offensive to the people of Iceland?? Then I did my research and found out that it's actually mostly foreigners who think it's offensive to Iceland, while Iceland gets the joke and is having a laugh. Stereotypes and over the top performances ARE Eurovision, so I ended up being glad they ran with it. They had some good Eurovision classic references in there and it was just an overall feel-good movie. I don't remember the last time I actually laughed out loud at a movie from the sheer sillyness of it. It wasn't a so bad it's good type of situation, but just genuinely an enjoyable movie."
"959","Eurovision Song Contest: The Story of Fire Saga",10,"Fabulous!!!","Loved this Movie from start to finish! They manage to include everything that's corny and typical for Eurovision and add it to the film. Togerher with Icelandic folk lore and how they are as a people, and also the warm and feel-good atmosphere makes for a great feeling throughout the Movie!In addition it's funny and foolish in best Will-Ferrell-manner with stomachache laughter guarantee.I absolutely loved this one!"
"960","Eurovision Song Contest: The Story of Fire Saga",9,"Super fun, old school comedy","We've been missing this type of comedy for a while. It straddles the line of funny and goofy perfectly. Tons of heart and emotion too. Great streaming flick during all this craziness"
"961","Eurovision Song Contest: The Story of Fire Saga",10,"Absolutley fantastic!","They don't make many films like this, stunning visuals, Rachel McAdams is great along with an excellent supporting cast."
"962","Eurovision Song Contest: The Story of Fire Saga",10,"Wow just wow !","I really love this movie. I have never heard of Eurovision before and this made me go on Apple Music and start listening to this type of music. Very much enjoyed this movie and the songs. It's a good family film, not dirty at all lol so it's safe I should say. Must be at least 13 of age though. But great movie :)"
"963","Eurovision Song Contest: The Story of Fire Saga",10,"OMG","Best Movie in 2020! Was better than i expectet!
Love from Denmark."
"964","Eurovision Song Contest: The Story of Fire Saga",10,"Will become almost a cult movie for some of us","I will start by admitting that I never liked Ferrell (at all), but after this movie he has earned my respect! The movie is relaxed, funny, cozy... And fuuull of details for Eurovision lovers. I have followed the contest for a long time and this movie was just purely Eurovision, and I can imagine purely Iceland too. It made me feel the Icelanders. The bad ratings come for sure from people who doesn't follow the show, since they re missing a lot of details. Looooved the end song, especially the part in Icelandic!!! And I loved that the festival was hosted in my beloved Edinburgh. I had a blast from begining to end. And so did my 6 year old!"
"965","Eurovision Song Contest: The Story of Fire Saga",7,"What a joy","Seriously enjoyable film, with its heart in the right place in so many respects. Funny - laugh out loud so, in a number of places - and touching. McAdams is outstanding in her role, as is Dan Stevens. A really good Friday night, feel-good film."
"966","Eurovision Song Contest: The Story of Fire Saga",9,"Brilliant","Gets better with every single watch. So many clever little one liners and lyrics. Brilliant."
"967","Eurovision Song Contest: The Story of Fire Saga",10,"Last Song Syndrome!","The Jaja Dingdong, Volcano Man, Mascarade are the songs that keeps running to my head! Done watching it for 4x. Hahaha! So funny."
"968","Eurovision Song Contest: The Story of Fire Saga",9,"Just the Final Song itself made me change this from a 7 to a 9","Will Ferrel is so synonymous with slapstick lowbrow comic, so I came into this movie with an average expectation of it.As usual, I was somewhat entertained by the comic scenes so Ferrel-isque of the main stars. I was ready to slap on a 7 for it.But whoah and behold, the song they sang was sooo powerful it resonated deep it gave me chills. The lyrics, the vocal, the arrangement.So 9 it is."
"969","Eurovision Song Contest: The Story of Fire Saga",8,"A good laugh","Surprisingly hilarious, you want regret watching it."
"970","Eurovision Song Contest: The Story of Fire Saga",8,"Watch it!","If you understand what Eurovision is all about, whether you like it or not, this comedy has something for you.
Laughed all the way through."
"971","Eurovision Song Contest: The Story of Fire Saga",10,"warm feeling","It's a rare thing a movie gives you a warm feeling it's been a while.
Rachel took my heart or we should say segret she is so pure and innocent not to forget the music and the songs which were actually very emotional for a comedy movie I don't mind have then on auto replay on my playlist 2 hours that I will never regret <3"
"972","Eurovision Song Contest: The Story of Fire Saga",8,"Great movie!","This is much better than I expected. It's very funny and touching at the same time. Makes me want to visit Iceland!"
"973","Eurovision Song Contest: The Story of Fire Saga",9,"Laughed so much.","Being a 'nil point' UK'er I found this film extremely funny despite the location inconsistencies. Thank you so much Will Ferrell for staying true to the Eurovision vibe. I will never be able to look at Dan Stevens in the same way again."
"974","Eurovision Song Contest: The Story of Fire Saga",10,"Volcano Man, He's got my melting heart","As a self confessed Eurovision loving family, we were awaiting this with anticipation and a little worry that it could be cruel, but I was aware Will Farrell was a fab or it. This shows, but is funny, moving, goofy. And really captures the essence of Eurovision. But I don't think you need to be a Eurovision fan to love this.
Great cameos, great sound track. We have already had multiple viewings. Thanks to Netflix and will Farrell for this utter gem"
"975","Eurovision Song Contest: The Story of Fire Saga",9,"ya ya ding dong","I'm not giving it a perfect score. The film is a bit too long.I can easily picture Will Ferrel's comedy brain sitting through a Eurovision Song Contest finale with his swedish in laws. Suddenly a light bulb appeares over his head... Let's get to work!I'm pleasently surprised about how good this movie was. It nailes the craziness perfectly. And the balance between drama and comedy was spot on.
Perfect execution. There's great insight here in how that highly entertaining song contest montrosity works. And it's done with respect.I love it when I laugh out loud while watching a movie. There's an ufortunate boat incident here that i should have seen coming. But I didn't. I had to press pause after that one...Watch it! Funny comedies doesn't come along very often."
"976","Eurovision Song Contest: The Story of Fire Saga",9,"I never write reviews, but..","I loved this movie, and I don't understand why it isn't better rated so felt obliged to leave a good rating. I feel like I owe that to the movie. Is that insane? Possibly. I can only assume the low ratings are left by people that don't know or understand Eurovision. This movie was everything I needed and took me back to watching Eurovision as a kid. Can't say enough good things about it."
"977","Eurovision Song Contest: The Story of Fire Saga",10,"This is Eurovision","As an Icelander, I don't understand why people would be ""offended"" for how this movie portrays Eurovision and Iceland. Will Ferrell did an amazing work and was HILARIOUS! This movie had me laughing and crying the whole time. It really captured the Icelandic spirit when it comes to Eurovision, and the ""insest"" jokes....well we are a small nation and we make fun of it as well. All in all, this is a beautiful, funny and (semi) accurate movie when it comes to Iceland and Eurovision! Definitely made up for the cancelation of Eurovision 2020.......which Iceland should have won btw!!"
"978","Eurovision Song Contest: The Story of Fire Saga",10,"I've waited all my life for a Eurovision Song Contest movie!","I was in shock when I heard that someone FINALLY made a movie about Eurovision Song Contest and literally RAN to Netflix to watch it. I LOVE Eurovision Song Contest. Will Farrell did such justice to the contest and I absolutely loved Rachel McAdams. Such a happy feel good movie that I highly recommend to anyone that want to a feel good movie. I love that more people know will know about Eurovision Song Contest!"
"979","Eurovision Song Contest: The Story of Fire Saga",10,"Lovely!","Heartwarming and entertaining. It surprisingly had one of the best song mashups I've ever heard, the performances were astonishing. The Icelandic pride was so damn touching, itll bring you to tears, no matter where you're from."

This film brought back my happy memories, and produced new ones. Thank you for making this film.The songs are beyond great, art in itself, and there's moments of magic and fun. It's the simple things that touch an audience, and this film made me laugh and cry all at once. Well-Done- Ya Ya Ding Dong! --My Home town."
"984","Eurovision Song Contest: The Story of Fire Saga",8,"Ignore the progressional reviews, they're probably American","Really solid, as usual the Americans seems to miss the point of there being nothing wrong with a normal small town life.
Also missing the point of the story following the real world Eurovision which they could brush up on with some out of America knowledge. We still love you, but I want to live where the whales can live cause they're gentle people."
"985","Eurovision Song Contest: The Story of Fire Saga",9,"Loved It","What a great film to be released at this time - underdog to hero story, funny and uplifting, great performances from Adams and Ferrell who hams is up just enough without going overboard. A simple feel good movie with enough laughs to make it a comedy and enough story around the the Eurovision process. Why not? A film for a cozy Saturday night. The music performances are not over long and the supporting cast hit the points needed. I enjoyed it - so there."
"986","Eurovision Song Contest: The Story of Fire Saga",9,"Nailed The Eurovision Vibe","Those who hate The Eurovision song contest (this film might not be for you)
Those who love watching it will love it, they have cracked the humour if it, the somewhat campness of the show and the diversity of acts.
Will a mild Will Ferrell has reigned his natural go to performance in a bit so that he hasn't over performed the role, and McAdams is just cute and wonderful in it.You can tell alot of work went in to making it authentic, well done!"
"987","Eurovision Song Contest: The Story of Fire Saga",8,"Sweet, touching and feel - good romantic comedy!","This is a wonderful feel good romantic comedy starring Will Ferrell and Rachel McAdams as a fictitious Icelandic duo ""Fire Saga"", Lars and Sigrit, who inadvertently end up representing their country in the Eurovision song contest. Although often ridiculed by even their own town folk, they nonetheless ultimately bring pride to their country and their hometown.The movie has been panned by some critics, who I felt kind of missed the point. Perhaps they were expecting a more traditional Will Ferrell comedy. But essentially, the movie is a winking tribute to the sometimes gaudy and goofy world of the eurovision contest, and also a romantic comedy (as Sigrit is in love with lars, who is oblivious to it all). Pic also features many cameos from contest winners who do a raucous sing-a-long in a nightclub, Demi Lovato and there are numerous fun and rousing musical numbers throughout it's runtime; meanwhile, Dan Stevens shows up in a slinky and uproarious turn as a Russian singer. Pierce Brosnan does a fine icelandic accent as Lars' fisherman father. There are some funny bits as well, including a laugh out loud moment involving elves. Yes, elves.The songs written for the fictional band such as Volcano Man and Ja Ja ding dong are suitably silly, while ""Double Trouble"" and especially the soaring closing number ""Husavik"" is a real show stopper and a rousing capper to a completely feel good movie.So best to ignore some of the critics; especially during these dreary times of pandemic and lockdowns, it is great to watch such a heartwarming, funny, tender and uplifting movie. Sure, it is schmaltz, but it's high quality schmaltz. When McAdams sings Husavik at the end, you will likely cheer."
"988","Eurovision Song Contest: The Story of Fire Saga",8,"Will Ferrell and Rachel McAdams are surprisingly a perfect team","Lately watching Rachel McAdams, I couldn't tell if she is acting or just being Rachel McAdams, but I have to say she really gives quite a funny performance here, I mean she was playing a character and not just playing herself. and her pairing with Will Ferrell proves to be quite a funny odd couple.It's not a comedy masterpiece, but it's Will Ferrell, if you've a good most of his comedies, you know what to expect here. Moments when he's not overdoing it, proves he's even more funnier. And Rachel McAdams is great, and her comedic timing is incredible. The musical numbers are also fun to watch. It has some raunchy moments but never goes to over board. It's just a comedy, and the film itself tells you not to take it self seriously."
"989","Eurovision Song Contest: The Story of Fire Saga",8,"Made with lots of love","Since Eurovison was cancelled this year this movie chose a good time to premier. It pokes lovingly fun and there's a lot of little easter eggs for fans. At times the jokes/plot gets a little too silly but overall this is a very fun, spot on parody of Eurovision Song Contest.Rachel McAdams were fabulous, Molly Sandén was a great fit as the voice. You couldn't tell Rachel was lip syncing at all. A lot of the supporting characters were great as well.The biggest minus I give is mostly the glaring, well known plot hole of a beautiful young woman who is for some reason attracted to a mediocre man played by the comedian who wrote the script."
"990","Eurovision Song Contest: The Story of Fire Saga",8,"It made me happy.","It made me happy. Loved the mash up. Was it the best movie ever? No. But I'm pretty sure I was smiling 90% of the time...then laughing, when the elves shanked the bad guy. Sick, I know. It was progressive without being forceful and full of happiness, good to see in 2020."
"991","Eurovision Song Contest: The Story of Fire Saga",7,"Much better than I expected.","First thing to say is that I'm a big Will Ferrell, and Eurovision, fan, and so I was a little dubious as to what to expect of this film.
I was very pleased to see that my fears were totally unfounded.
In a year when there was no Eurovision to watch, this made for an acceptable substitute.
Whilst a viewer would not need to be totally au fait with Eurovision to enjoy this movie, I do feel that a liking for the subject helps increase the pleasure.
There were several laugh out loud moments for me.
The storyline was a little predictable, but this did not matter at all for me.
Very enjoyable."
"992","Eurovision Song Contest: The Story of Fire Saga",7,"Great music, just not Will","The singer that sings for Rachel McAdams character is so unbelievably talented, and the final song honestly deserves to win the Oscar for best original song (move over Shallow) however I feel like Will Ferrells singing and part almost ruined the songs. I've never been a huge Will fan, and from the previews I thought he may surprise me, but it's just Will being Will. And the singer that does duets with him just blows me away every time she sings, and then he sings and it just really dampers it.
With that being said, besides the weird romance between the ""maybe siblings"" it was a great plot and very entertaining.I also really really loved Olafur Darri Olafsson in this. I watch him as Bing on the show NOS4A2U and I'm very impressed with his range of acting."
"993","Eurovision Song Contest: The Story of Fire Saga",10,"Amazing are you kidding me?","This is a movie the whole world needs right now. Of course its a comedy its Will F but its also an amzingly well produced feel good movie with F#@!#ing amazing song at the end. Top performances from everyone involved."
"994","Eurovision Song Contest: The Story of Fire Saga",9,"Elves and tall glasses combined in a nice way.","Well, that was a surprise.A Netflix film that is not overloaded with social commentary, political correctness running amok, social engineering, etc...
When people put these things aside, it is possible to make something entertaining, lighthearted and pleasant to watch. I guess not everything is lost.This is a fun film, Will Ferrell and Rachel Adams make a perfect pair with great chemistry.Great fun."
"995","Eurovision Song Contest: The Story of Fire Saga",10,"Just brilliant!","I absolutely LOVED!! This film. It had me in fits of laughter from the simple one liners to tears in a matter of minutes, this film really tugs on those heart strings while delivering the element of comedy and musicals, your crazy if you don't like this film."
"996","Eurovision Song Contest: The Story of Fire Saga",10,"Thank You Will Ferrell and Rachel McAdams!","The white spandex suit, shake weight and ""classic camel"" scene, ALONE, made me forget about the pandemic. Classic Ferrell!"
"997","Eurovision Song Contest: The Story of Fire Saga",10,"Fire Saga brings joy to the world!","This film is totally fantastic - got a pastiche if Eurovision - my Soul is filled with joy - the film
Studies the passion for Eurovision - I lived in Greece for 10 years and in Europe Eurovision is mega - Will Ferrell's study of the competition conveys it all - I watched it 4 times first weekend - it's a classic and totally wonderful!"

"1001","Knives Out",9,"Bravo!","Nothing was typical about this. Everything was beautifully done in this movie, the story, the flow, the scenario, everything.
I highly recommend it for mystery lovers, for anyone who wants to watch a good movie!"
"1002","Knives Out",8,"Bringing back the classic whoddunit in amazingly entertaining fashion - 8/10 <U+2B50>","What an excellent film by Rian Johnson; definitely feels like the film he was destined to make. Writing that is slick as hell, sublime performances (most notably Daniel Craig who brings his A-game in a wonderfully charismatic turn), superb editing and wonderfully atmospheric music - all tied together by masterful direction. Will probably be among the most fun you have at a theatre this year and fans of Agatha Christie and old murder mystery stories will have plenty to love here - a nostalgically entertaining time!"
"1003","Knives Out",8,"Pimp My Agatha Christie!","With the exception of my wife and daughter, and possibly my mother, Agatha Christie is the woman whom I love most on this planet. She truly was the most gifted and brilliant fiction writer who ever lived, and it rejoices me to see that her work still inspires other writers and filmmakers nowadays; more than forty years after she passed away. There are still many adaptations of her original work, but with ""Knives Out"", writer/director Rian Johnson attempts something entirely different. It's abundantly clear that Johnson was inspired by all of Christie's typical trademarks and hobby-horses, and he pays tribute to her most legendary characters and favorite settings, but the plot of ""Knives Out"" is entirely new and scripted directly for the screen. A good old-fashioned murder mystery/whodunit set in the enormous mansion of a wealthy family, full of eccentric people each of whom have dirty little secrets, convoluted plot twists, continuous red herrings that practically make it impossible to guess along, and a fabulous all-knowing but slightly odd sleuth slowly unravelling the clues.Daniel Craig is downright terrific as Benoit Blanc, a private detective with a bizarre accent and weird one-liners, hired by someone anonymous to dig deeper into the strange and sudden death of patriarch Harlan Thrombey. It looks like suicide, but literally every greedy member of Harlan's bloodline had a motive for killing and - also in delightful Agatha Christie tradition - the plot even thickens after the reading of the will. It would be a shame to reveal too much about the plot, but rest assured that is refreshing and inventive, compelling as well as humorous, complex but simultaneously light-headed and 200% entertaining. The cast is phenomenal. Craig clearly enjoyed depicting a heroic protagonist that is the complete opposite of his James Bond character, and the Thrombey family exclusively exists of great talents, including Jamie Lee Curtis, Michael Shannon, Toni Colette, Christopher Plummer and Don Johnson. ""Knives Out"" is perhaps slightly too long, but never tedious, and very well-directed by Rian Johnson (who honestly doesn't deserve all this hatred from disappointed ""Star Wars"" geeks)"
"1004","Knives Out",8,"Hated Last Jedi. Loved this.","As a fan of mysteries (Sherlock Holmes, Poirot, Columbo, Monk, Psych.etc.) I was thrilled to see someone making a classic style whodunnit...and the cast! Figure you can't go wrong. Well I enjoyed it & while the cast all have time to shine it is Daniel Craig with his Southern drawl & especially Ana de Armas that steal the show. For anyone keeping away because they hated The Last Jedi...I agree, it was my least favourite of all the Star Wars films, but this is a well written film that was well acted and I can only hope this will inspire others to reinvigorate the murder mystery genre."
"1005","Knives Out",10,"6.8?!?! Watch the goddam movie for sakes y'all Star Wars fans","Best movie of the year, love everything about it, what I'm seeing is that some trolls that still can't get over TLJ, now for those that have and give it a 1 well that's fair but have some reasons why, not just bc it's Rian Johnson, like stop it's childish"
"1006","Knives Out",9,"fun time at the movies","I enjoyed this a lot. Clever, interesting and plausible in its logic. I enjoyed the deception put forth by the characters. I can usually tell where something is going and was genuinely surprised by the hole in the hole of the donut.Some people might hate the politics of it, but I thought it gave a good dig at both sides while still being fairly liberal. FOX watchers will hate it, which I can see as kind of fueling the negative reviews.What can also fuel the negative reviews. is all the positive hype about it. Too much enthusiasm from the critics can hurt a movie sometimes. Viewers go into the theater expecting too much.Things never live up to the hype and this one didn't live up to it for me. But I thought it was still pretty solid and entertaining. I'm not sorry I spent some money on this one."
"1007","Knives Out",5,"overrated overstuffed film","Good acting
Awful story
Social message was preachy and unnecessary

Intersting characters"
"1008","Knives Out",5,"Utterly and totally Ridiculous accent by Daniel Craig","The movie is a ""meh"" but Mr. Craig's voice is just stupidily wrong...!"
"1009","Knives Out",6,"Just saw it and do not understand the hype","I'm a mystery lover and have seen and read every Agatha Christie tale. I found this movie very slow for the first half. Second half picked up but again there was no deep mystery of whodunit, nor the charm and period atmosphere of a Poirot episode (which I can watch over and over - thank you David Suchet and the other main actors). The lead actress was very attractive, but the vomiting was definitely disgusting to watch, as well as ridiculously unbelievable (I guess that was the funny part?). Some of the characters had been under the sunlamp too many times or smoked way too often and looked weather-beaten. Did not like the sucking on cigars constantly. The last part was more entertaining and finally there was the rapid-fire conclusion thank the Lord. Agree that Daniel Craig with that southern accent was just super annoying. Great grandmother bored me after first moments of her being silent in an odd hat. Over and over. It moved pretty slowly for me at times. I guess I'm in a minority on this one. I'm not saying it was terrible but it was not a great movie for me."
"1010","Knives Out",4,"Massively underwhelming","Being a middle aged Englishman I've been brought up on a diet of murder mystery stories and in many respects I've been spoilt. When the stories have translated from book to screen the production value is almost always secondary to the good conjunct story. I was very excited, having read the reviews, that seemingly in the case of 'Knives Out' I would be getting a rare trinity of a good story, good actors and good production. It certainly has two of the three. Unfortunately this film thinks it's cleverer than it is. It's simply a story of a privileged family and their pettiness with a rather trivial murder mystery chucked in as a contrivance to get them all together. Rian Johnson attempts to display the worst nature of the privileged minority with all the subtlety of a man screaming 'I am woke' at the top of his lungs at anybody who'll listen. Unfortunately subtlety and nuance are what makes for a good mystery story, you need to pay attention so as not to miss anything. With this film you could miss probably the middle third of the film and you'd not be any less aware of what's happening. A bit of a shame really."
"1011","Knives Out",8,"Brilliant <U+0001F3A5><U+0001F44D><U+0001F3FB>","Highly recommend this movie for quarantine viewing.<U+2728><U+0001F44C><U+0001F3FB>"
"1012","Knives Out",6,"Just okay","Mildly entertaining with a great cast and high production value. The story is soft but not awful. I can't imagine saying this film deserves more than a 6."
"1013","Knives Out",6,"It's like, did I miss something","I saw the film a few months back and now that I noticed it is available for home watch decided to check the eating again, as at the time it was way too high in my opinion. I thought it would have gone down. It has not. Did I miss something spectacular about this film? Do I not have a sense of humor? I don't get it. It was ok. A bit slow. And absolutely nothing special. I think the ending was revealed too early and the twist was not suprising nor did I care about it. Weird."
"1014","Knives Out",4,"Inexplicable hype for a mediocre film","Knives out uses a really old idea, the ""whodunit"". Unfortunately, contrary to what many claim, there is not much here that makes it particular different or modern, except some hipster dialogue and humor (including a lot of throwing up by a specific character) and some commentary on current social issues, like the immigrant crisis, and pointing fingers at the ultra-rich, which is ironic because the writer/director of this movie is by now a multimillionaire and one of the highest paid directors in Hollywood. The writing is full of supposedly smart dialogue and ideas. In reality there not much cleverness here, while it constantly feels like the movie is trying too hard, and comes across as very pretentious and smugish. Most of the humor falls completely flat, it is overlong (130 minutes), twists are not surprising and don't really make sense. Only bright spots, Daniel Craig's amusing performance and the very talented Ana de Armas. Other than that, a semi-entertaining, mediocre and ultimate forgettable film. A perfect example of an uninspired writer/director, with a complete lack of originality, who uses a boring overused premise and accomplishes nothing new or interesting in the least.Personally I don't know much about Star Wars as I don't really follow pop-corn franchises, so I don't know what's going on with this director and Star Wars. However, it is very puzzling seeing this mediocre film which basically takes place in a house, getting so much marketing hype and buzz, while Hollywood seems to be in love with this movie and its' director. Looking around the internet for reviews and ratings one would think this is a serious Oscar contender for multiple awards, while some people are calling it the best movie of the year and calling out trolls (?) etc. I'm confused."
"1015","Knives Out",8,"Nice take on murder mystery!","Generally speaking you tend to find more murder mystery TV shows than movies, this is partially since it's hard to build a complete mystery in the allotted movie running time.
This movie builds this murder beautifully by showing the different points of views of the suspects. It has a different take than other movies since it gives the viewer a little too much details mid-movie which leaves you questioning everything to the last minute.
The acting was brilliant and I didn't feel the number of characters was overdoing it at any stage."
"1016","Knives Out",4,"It's a mystery","It's a mystery to me why this movie got so many good reviews. The acting is fine but the story isn't anything exceptional and is very slow moving. Add in social commentary that is so out of place that it distracts even more from an already marginal story. But I guess that's the movie business today."
"1017","Knives Out",8,"A fun little mystery with a slick pay off","Knives Out (2019)
8/10<U+0001F5E1><U+0001F6AA><U+0001F489><U+0001F4B8>""Rian Johnson successfully revives the ""whodunnit"" mystery subgenre with this perfectly cast fun time, even if it doesn't bring anything groundbreaking to the table.""Knives Out is the kind of ""whodunnit"" film that will never fail to entertain. As a progressive mystery, Knives Out is a very fashionable movie with it's grand ensemble of fresh and familiar faces. With some very snarky and slick writing, these characters are albeit memorable, most notably Daniel Craig's Detective Blanc and Chris Evan's Ransome, however, the film fails to make full use of the ensemble to the greatest extent. Of course that never takes away from what else Knives Out has to offer. The intensity of every moment that leaves you questioning the motive and action behind the titled crime scene is delivered with such glorious fashion, one could say Murder on the Orient Express had a beautiful baby, this being the result, showing Rian Johnson's strongholds. While the first two acts of the movie are quite strong and promising, the third act finds itself being a little rough around the edges but manages to find it's footing upon the conclusion; one for all and all for one.Verdict: Knives Out not only proves to us that Rian Johnson is a strong director with the right material, but also displays a fashionable reiteration of what the mystery genre can do to keep us guessing what is left in store for us to see in all the right ways."
"1018","Knives Out",6,"Would have been an order of magnitue better without Johnston's warbled symbolism","The idea of it mattering more what you do with the truth than the pursuit of it is a clever one, but instead of shining a light on prejudice, bias, and arrogance, it actually encourages all of these things in the audience by confirming all of those things in the end instead of destroying them.We're led to hate everyone who deserves hating right off the bat, and that never changes. What's worse, the people we're led to find innocuous only become more so as the story progresses. In short nobody grows and it ends up being a somewhat terrible mystery. It gets points for twists and turns, but none of those happen because of changes in the characters behavior or outlook. Johnston put all of the characters in their place from the get-go and never let them even wiggle slightly.The acting saves this movie. It is definitely worth watching just for the magnificent performances by everyone involved. It is just sad that they had to 'pay the pound' for Johnston's gross soapboxing, while the penny was the movie and mystery itself.It's interesting that there was an attempt to make fun of both SJWs and Nazis in this, while it so blatantly implied that rich entitled Americans are everything bad and illegal immigrants are everything good and hard-working. Such an unnecessary subtext in a murder mystery. especially considering it doesn't change throughout the movie...it's actually the one thing that's consistent."
"1019","Knives Out",1,"Made it through the first half hour or so...","Very disappointing. Found it incredibly boring and then the bit with the nurse puking if she tells a lie combined with Daniel Craig's crappy attempt at a Southern U.S. accent pushed it over the edge for me. I love ""whodunnits"", but after 30 minutes I knew I'd seen enough to know this wasn't going to be my type of movie."
"1020","Knives Out",5,"Don't believe the hype - this is just dull","Obviously this film has a sophisticated marketing strategy - nothing else would explain the high ratings it gets. I was looking forward to it but unfortunately it's just boring and dull. You'll find more charisma and excitement in a daytime soap. Ana de Armas is the only actor worth watching, while the film exposes the limitations of Daniel Craig and Chris Evans. I wouldn't recommend wasting your time on this."
"1021","Knives Out",5,"The problem with the film is its unfulfilled potential.","Others have mentioned the old house might have held some secrets (it didn't). Or that it might present a more structured ""Whodunit"" that leaves you guessing (it didn't). Or that the main character might offer a bit of verve, cleverness or pizazz, that might have livened up the whole affair (she doesn't, at all).I also take some issue with the director's choices in scene framing, especially in the beginning. There should have been more close-ups, and better initial intros for each character's little idiosyncrasies so we would could warm up to them. I simply don't care for how it was shot; it's terribly pedestrian. The fast, quick edits of the trailer are totally absent! There's something missing here. Todd Solondz, Tim Burton or the Cohen Brothers really could have drawn these characters out more and given the actors something real to work with.I thought it would sparkle with a bit more witty, dark humor. It wasn't quite as funny or snappy as I was expecting it to be. Instead, it settles on delivering more of a ""message"" about this girl, who does good, while the others do bad.There's also no need for Daniel Craig's poor Southern accent. He should have just done a British accent, it would have been fine and enjoyable, maybe given the film a bit more weight it seems it was shooting for, in the end, with its messaging.Additional viewings might reveal there's more to it, but I suspect such might reveal there's less."
"1022","Knives Out",1,"Really?","This has to be one of the most boring unoriginal films I've ever seen. I was so angry I felt like getting my money back. The plot was something a 10 year old could think up and the acting, if you can call it acting was so bad I thought i was watching a low budget improv schools last effort at acknowledement before it closes down. Daniel Craig's accent, what the hell was that supposed to be. They should all be very ashamed."
"1023","Knives Out",1,"Why does James Bond have a hilly billy accent?","Absolutely disgraceful, good for the first 40 minutes but takes a quick downhill slide into a script that might have been written by a 5 year old. The usual happy bs ending of course; no intensity or twists left me feeling robbed of my time of life. Even my son could've finished off this story with a more thrilling and jaw dropping twist."
"1024","Knives Out",5,"Boring and predictable","For such a cast and an oscar nomination this film is too plain, boring and too much predictable."
"1025","Knives Out",4,"Couldn't make it to the twist's twist.","I kept wondering why we were watching. The idea was interesting but didn't allow for the viewer to watch more than snippets of action at a time. It's was a study in 'tell don't show' expository and if anything happened at all it must have happened at the end. I couldn't make it through more than an hour and was surprised there was an hour more to go when I hit stop. Knives Out is a poor attempt at dark comedy thriller that was sold to the masses via celebrity stunt casting and beautiful cinematography and color grading. It may look like something more than Hollywood popcorn fluff but it isn't. This movie will be forgotten as soon as the next one in its genre is released."
"1026","Knives Out",2,"Bored to tears","Boring is the day is long. Wanted to leave the theater but my sister liked it. Seemed to go on forever. Also full of woke SJW agenda pushing. Good acting."
"1027","Knives Out",5,"Nothing Special","I say it's nothing special and I'm not a Star Wars fanatic. I've never even seen the film people are so angry about, so my review is based purely on my experience of watching this film, Knives Out.I definitely expected more. If it's meant to be amusing, it pretty much failed on that score. This film would be better suited as a TV movie, if they even make them anymore, or something to pop up on Netflix. I didn't pay to see it and I'd feel I'd wasted my money if I had.Visually it was enjoyable-I mean the location, the house, the production values. the family members were an unattractive bunch, so nothing to look at there. Daniel Craig's ""southern"" accent became grating after awhile, and I was squirming a bit with boredom, waiting for it to be over. And, when it was, my reaction was ""So what? Who cares?"" I can hardly remember any of it and I just watched it in the last couple of hours.Convoluted, unrealistic and tedious, like a lot of Agatha Christie stories. How this has ended up on some people's Best Films of 2019 lists is beyond me. It was okay; nothing special."
"1028","Knives Out",2,"Juvenile and underwhelming","This movie feels like a teenager made it. It has underwhelming oohs and aahs that kind of make you cringe. Daniel Craig with and Arkansas accent doesn't help. The "" mystery"" was solved in the first 5 minutes and we were hoping for a surprise ending but just got what we figured."
"1029","Knives Out",1,"Lousy Whodunnit, avoidable farce","This is just a lousy immigrant propaganda by the left-leaning wing of hollywood. Disappointing and predictable, to say the least. One cannot imagine Rian made the masterpiece Brick, after seeing this joke of a movie."
"1030","Knives Out",1,"Why the great reviews???","What a truly painful film. It felt like it was never going to end. I couldn't have cared less about any of the characters or how the old bloke died.Amateurish acting and Daniel Craig's accent was shockingly bad. I always thought he was a good actor but after this shambles I have changed my point of view.The film dragged on and on and on with very predictable twists here and there, but due to poor character development and as all were totally dislikeable why would we care. Obviously we are supposed to root for the nurse but whatever.Don't believe the hype with this. It's boring, close up face shots throughout which would be better for TV, cringeworthy lead from Craig and no dynamic direction or cinematography.I'll never get that time back or money.Pathetic."
"1031","Knives Out",3,"How does this have such a high rating","This is comparable to a Colombo or Murder She Wrote but with an all star cast of no memorable performances and a typically wooden turn by Craig. How this movie was green lighted beggars belief but if you're drunk with two hours to fill then it may be just the ticket."
"1032","Knives Out",10,"The IMDb star-rating on this is so inaccurate, it's pathetic!","I actually wish  would do away with the star-rating portion of their website because it doesn't give an accurate rating for films and this film is a perfect example. Everyone knows that there are many bitter Star Wars fanboys rating this film low because they are still so bitter over Rian Johnson's The Last Jedi and as a result, they are going to try to ruin any of Rian's future films. They really need to just get over it and get a life, already. DON'T believe the Star-Rating of This Film Because It's Mostly from Bitter Star Wars Fanboys Rating the Film LOW ON PURPOSE!, obviously. Anyone who has actually seen this film would be brain-dead to rate it low or to not give it a good review because this film is so freaking entertaining! I could see it again and again. It's so different than the crap that has been in the theaters lately. It's fun, it's thrilling, it's wacky, it has so many twists and turns that it always keeps you guessing. And for the cast, what a freaking cast! I couldn't even tell you who the MVP of the cast was. They were all fantastic. We need more films like this and less big explosions, stupid plot films. I for one, will give this the true star-rating it deserves! 10/10!!!!! Bitter Star Wars fanboys, you can keep being immature and rating it low, but it isn't going to change the fact that the film is great and I'm going to encourage every single person to go out and see it pronto when it hits theaters!"
"1033","Knives Out",NA,"Dire","I wish I had something good to say about this. A bland script, dull characters, a totally miscast Daniel Craig with an awful Southern accent and you are in for a painful night at the cinema. If you love murder mysteries / whodunnits, you need to avoid this. It can't even decide if it's trying to be fun or serious. In the end it's neither."
"1034","Knives Out",1,"Horrible Horiible Horrible","I can't believe I wasted my life watching this terrible film. It was poorly executed and filled with hollywood elitist BS. Really politically motivated and nauseating. If you don't saddle right up with the hollywood elite and their ideology, prepare to have it shoved down your throat. The mystery part was weak and boring. Not at all worth your time"
"1035","Knives Out",4,"Stylish and Very Stupid","The movie plays like the worst episode of COLUMBO you have ever seen, only this time it features Daniel Craig attempting to imitate Foghorn Leghorn. Learn from my mistake and avoid this turkey."
"1036","Knives Out",5,"Overrated","Really boring for the most time. Lots of wasted potential."
"1037","Knives Out",4,"Don't bother","I felt like Daniel Craig was supposed to take the place of the excommunicated Kevin Spacey. What a stupid accent for Craig.
Overall, meh...Pretty boring. Not sure who's watching this movie and saying it's great. Their bar must be set pretty low."
"1038","Knives Out",6,"Not what I expected and what I saw didn't make me appreciate it any more...","Having quality actors and good critical reception, I thought this movie will be fun, so I watched it with my mom, as we love those ""Clue/Cluedo"" style comedy movies. I expected a comedy about weird characters in a mansion trying to solve a murder. Sadly, movie takes a different turn, innovates and changes the old formula of movie like this. This is sad not because of the sole fact that the formula is changed, but because the movie felt really long and boring. It's ending is fun, but... Yeah... This is actually just a classic crime movie, with a few humorous moments. And nothing else. Having in mind the great cast, I expected so much more from this movie and can't help but to fell really disappointed. It could have been so much more! Eh... It's not a bad movie.... It's an OK movie... But not a great one for sure. 6.5/10! It can still be fun and give you a few laughs, but don't expect too much, because you simply won't find it here..."
"1039","Knives Out",3,"Should only work for people who haven't seen anything in the genre","I want to start by saying that I live for crime mysteries so I am 100% in the target audience. I'm quite familiar with the genre and I love everything in it by default.However, this movie had too many flaws and I can't understand how it has such a high score. My only guess is that most of the people who voted are incredibly unfamiliar with the genre and don't have a reference point.Anyway, let's get to the chase. For a crime mystery it's incredibly important to get the audience to ask the right questions. There have to be very few very clear and interesting questions. And this is the most important thing the movie does not get right. The questions change all the time, they are too many, they are unclear, too simple, some too easy to figure out anyway. And we have this issue both in regards to the plot and to the characters. So the mystery part is done incredibly poorly.The crime part is almost OK but a lot of the time it's all over the place. We didn't get a proper view of the picture in regards to the crime that took place. What exactly was done and how, what the police see as being suspicious and why, dissection of the motives of the characters and, you know, and actual investigation. It would have been fine if it wasn't such a crucial part of the story and if at least the mystery or the drama was very good.So, next on the list is the drama. This is the only genre that actually has something to offer here. Trying to work with the characters' differences in moral stances and ethics was a very good idea, unfortunately this part of the script was in embryonic state. I believe that if they went with that as their main guiding line and main genre the movie could have been very good.Lastly, if you go in expecting comedy... I hope you will be able to see any. It is beyond me how this is even listed as a genre here. The movie is light and easy to digest but that's not really comedy.Other general notes:1. Casting was fine but I have no idea what they were even trying to do with the Daniel Craig character. In the beginning I needed quite some time just to get used to him and for the rest of the movie he was below average. I admit, I truly can't even guess their intentions there. Other than that I found the casting and acting to be enjoyable.2. I found the music to be just as messy as the story and the mix of genres. I am sympathetic because it must have been really difficult to figure out what the movie is supposed to be and therefore how to make the soundtrack.3. I would really like to say something good or that I would recommend it anyway to people who haven't seen anything of the genre at least, unfortunately I just can't do that. It felt undercooked and messy. I would not watch any sequels they decide to make. Any British crime movie or TV show is a hundred times better in all aspects so why waste my time.I hope this is not where detective movies are headed. First Kenneth Branagh and now this... There are plenty of people who know how to make these movies right, just give them a chance, Hollywood!"
"1040","Knives Out",1,"To easy to guess a boring movie","Let me ask you this. You ask some very good actors to be in your movie and then you give them nothing to do. That is the problem with this movie. All the famous actor have nothing to do and their part are very small. The so called murder you figured it out in less then 10 minutes. And Craig accent sucks badly. It's very hard to listen to him. I could not wait for this movie to end I was ready to leave after 10 minutes into it. Wow boring."
"1041","Knives Out",1,"This movie insults your intelligence","The director wants to prove that he is clever so badly, but there are so many plotholes it is glaringly obvious to anyone with an IQ above 50..."
"1042","Knives Out",1,"American Audiences are dumb and Hollywood enables Americans' Idiocy","This is a poorly done Hollywood rip off of an Agatha Christie story. For the ""who-done-it"" genre, there is a certain format that you're supposed adhere to that you save all your reveals until the end, but in this film, they show the reveals right after they set them up in the first act. However, what do you expect from a Hollywood film that panders to idiot Americans that need to be spoon fed every plot point in a film."
"1043","Knives Out",2,"Stupid--just stupid","I wasted an afternoon watching this because I had to kill some time and it was the only show in the time window I had. I didn't like it at all. The wildly improbable plot (a girl who pukes if she tells a lie? really?) was comical."
"1044","Knives Out",1,"Boring","One of the most borring movies I have ever seen. Despite top actors and a really good performance from all the actors, the movie lacks plot, and you find yourself knowing who the killer and the weak plot within the first hour, which leaves the movie in one long tedious dialog between all the characters. Can not recommend."
"1045","Knives Out",1,"Hate Hate Hate all the Hollywood PC preaching and this is no better","Ok ok, we get it, Mexicans are great and deserve everything white people have even though they nothing to do with the founding of this country. Cool! Oh and white men suck. Thanks for the message Hollywood! I got it!"
"1046","Knives Out",1,"Political propaganda - and on top of that - boring","So the writer and director wanted to shove morality cakes down the viewers throats.
And to do that they probably were rewarded a fee of millions.There should be a political warning or a PC badge on movies nowadays - so the film lover who want to see a movie without the liberal propaganda could avoid it."
"1047","Knives Out",1,"An honest review of an awful film","I really wanted to like this film. I love whodunit films, from Agatha Christie to Murder She Wrote, the intrigue and mystery of this sub-genre can be very interesting and entertaining in the right hands. Yet here, with this film, none of the intrigue or mystery is either interesting nor entertaining, and like the awful humour, misses its mark! I like puzzles that hint at me, not hit me over the nose, and 'Knives Out' is a poor man's murder mystery - a very easy 1 out of 10."
"1048","Knives Out",6,"Another Left Wing Lecture for $14","It's a good movie, completely different twist. But it's impossible to fully enjoy as you are getting left wing lectured from the opening scene until the end."
"1049","Knives Out",1,"Socialist drivel injected into a terrible plot","I guess the only people who can stand this tripe are too dumb to see the political narrative that is interwoven through the entire movie."

I was glad when it finished. There's no depth to this. Kermode thinks it's a work of genius. It isn't. Was Daniel Craig impressive? No, not really.
Was anything else impressive? Not at all.
A decent cast which delivers almost nothing.
A work of no obvious merit that's totally overblown."
"1051","Knives Out",3,"Zzz","One of the most boring films I have ever watched. Unbelievable characters and so unrealistic."
"1052","Knives Out",1,"Overrated and Boring","Not sure how this film has managed to get anywhere near to an 8 - it is a very dull film that thinks it is cleverer than it actually is! Not a case of Whodunit but more like Whocares."
"1053","Knives Out",10,"The perfect whodunnit film","Beautifully filmed and thought out very well which to me is good enough! Great ensemble cast that did excellent acting among adding hilarious parts in many scenes. Absolutely love Daniel Craig and Ana De Amas did awesome! I'm sure Knives Out has mixed opinions but I am very glad I got to see an early screening."
"1054","Knives Out",1,"Pretentious Waste of Time by a Egotistical Hack","Not satisfied with butchering Star Wars, Rian Johnson sets out to do a poor man's ripoff of the films of Jonathan Lynn like Clue and Greedy. The script is pretentious, trying way too hard to be clever, and is about as subtle as a sledge hammer to the face, the actors do the best they can with a dreadful script, but it's all around a waste of time that will only be enjoyed by hipsters.Anyone who creates a character to mock their critics is clearly too immature to be directing films. Stop giving this hack work and do not waste your time on this drivel."
"1055","Knives Out",1,"Agenda pushing crap!!","Another movie about whites being awful and the Rick grandfather giving all his money to the nurse/caretaker and immigrant mother.
It was offensive and crap.
White hate is everywhere.
Disgusting and racistThe millionaire granddaddy left everything to his Brazilian caretaker and her undocumented mother.
I went to go see a good movie, it's now impossible.
All politics and brainwashing.
I'm honestly disgusted
They even mentioned nazis and snowflakes and the family argued.
I was honestly taken aback
Horrible movie.
All trying to subliminally tell Rick white men who are dying to leave their fortune to NOT atheist deserving families, but undocumented immigrants"
"1056","Knives Out",1,"Why?","Why all the praise for a poorly written, over-acted, pretentious comedy that has nothing going for it except a few good lines. Far too long. Far too many dead scenes. Far too many jokes that don't work. Save yourself two dull hours and watch something, anything else. Seriously."
"1057","Knives Out",1,"Thought it looked good from the trailer... it sucked","Within the first 20mins I guessed the ending. Then it felt like absolutely nothing happens in the middle. The best jokes are in the last 10mins, and they definitely aren't worth it. The writing reminded me of an aspiring 20 year old who only wished they could write something interesting but doesn't have the life experience yet. Very disappointed in this shabby story."
"1058","Knives Out",1,"Worst film in a long time","If you seriously think the ending has an unpredicted twist you are mentally challenged.
If you wanna watch brilliant detective who did it turn to Poirot and Miss Marple.
My God, this movie sucked."
"1059","Knives Out",8,"Nice","Good story with a creative and effective delivery. Very well written screenplay with all loose ends tied up together and reasonable foreshadowing and morals that echoes throughout, but there weren't any striking moments even to the point of final reveal, possibly due to the addition of yet more details approaching the end in an attempt to create a (slightly) forced satisfying end. Unnecessary characters and scenes that serve little to no purpose in the story other than for comedic effect were present, which maybe one of the reasons why audience may have a sense of emptyness when leaving the theatre. Nonetheless, Knives Out remains a fresh form of storytelling that is trying to achieve and convey more than your ordinary murder mystery."
"1060","Knives Out",1,"Biggest Disappointment of the Year","This movie has arguably the worst writing I've ever experienced. I was incredibly excited to see it for months. I tried to stay away from excessively watching trailers or reviews to come in with as little of an expectation as I could. Which for me was hard. I adore the entire cast, I have thoroughly enjoyed some of Rian Johnson's earlier work (Star Wars excluded), and I got caught up in the nostalgia of a thrilling ""whodunnit"". Upon seeing it, I was very quickly shocked by the lack of originality, the completely cheesy dialogue, and a horrendous and obvious plot. I have never walked out of a theater in my life but this is the closest that I've ever come. I openly laughed at how bad the dialogue and plot points were. The entire theater was silent except to grimace. Don't waste your time or your hopes."
"1061","Knives Out",9,"How can this film currently have a 6.8 rating when it's one of the best pictures of the year?!","Sometimes I am shocked when I see a great film...only to see it has an incredibly low overall score on IMDB. This is definitely the case with ""Knives Out""....a great film by writer/director Rian Johnson that I strongly recommend you see. In fact, I wouldn't be surprised if this one receives some Oscar nominations...it's that good.""Knives Out"" is like an Agatha Christie novel set in modern day America and with American characters. But it's not just a homage to Christie-style films but a genuinely good and unique film in its own right. Kudos to many of the actors...particularly Daniel Craig. I thought Craig was miscast as a Southern American detective....but he carried it off wonderfully.Overall, I have no complaints...nothing I disliked or would do differently. In fact, it was so good I nearly gave it a 10....and I completely enjoyed the movie."
"1062","Knives Out",4,"Misleading reviews","I was so hyped for this movie after seeing the star studded cast and the rave reviews online. A movie with Daniel Craig, Chris Evans and Jamie Lee Curtis, I couldn't ask for more. However, the pacing is slow and the ""big twist"" is quite underwhelming. The jokes fall flat and aren't done well, I was expecting some great thrilling mystery and bust out laughing jokes but it sadly was a dud."
"1063","Knives Out",3,"An honest review","The shills are out in force for this , frankly forgettable, movie. There seems to be a constant stream of 10/10 reviews which read as though the poster hasn't even seen the film.
The film looks good but the plot and character motivations don't make much sense in the face of anything other than casual scrutiny.
That said I did enjoy the first act. If the rest of the film had continued in that tone it would have undoubtedly earned a higher score for me.
The second act is very pedestrian and drags,but the film falls apart in the denouement.
Has zero rewatch potential. Wait for it on TV or streaming."
"1064","Knives Out",5,"I don't get the hype for this movie","It was a little boring and too long. Great cast but I don't see why it deserves all this acclaim."
"1065","Knives Out",1,"Better than a 1 but NEEDS balance","As of writing this on 11/30/19, this movie has over an 8 rating....and that is just BAFFLING. It tries so hard to surprise and shock, yet none of the twists are surprising nor shocking. Movie's with over an 8 on IMDB are reserved for the upper echelon, the absolute best of the best. This, being generous, deserves a 6 out of 10 (I'd rank it at a 4 out of 10). The only reason I can see it getting more is because people want to see themselves as artsy and cinematic experts. It's a bland murder mystery with a good cast that is WAY too long and never delivers on any front."
"1066","Knives Out",1,"Really horrible","Basic synopsis:
White legacy Americans = bad
Hispanic illegal Americans = good.Written and directed by a white guy who would NEVER give up his birthright and inheritance to anyone. Especially a Hispanic"
"1067","Knives Out",2,"BORING - PASS ON IT","This little film was boring. I can't understand the good reviews it was given. Seemed more like a bad Columbo as someone else stated. Interesting that they cast Jamie Lee as a mother, looks more like she's 80."
"1068","Knives Out",1,"Boring","It felt like it was 10 hours long! So slow and boring I couldn't wait for it to finish!"
"1069","Knives Out",1,"I would like my 2 hours back, please","Mildly interesting plot. Could not move pass the in-your-face political agenda"
"1070","Knives Out",2,"Eh mystery with alot of social commentary","Pretty alright mystery, hard to ignore alot of social commentary. Pretty standard set up a wealthy conservative family and make them seem like the worst people in the world type of deal"
"1071","Knives Out",6,"Family bad, immigrants good","I was recommended this movie as a classic whodunit with clever twists and colorful characters. But the twists weren't all too clever and the whodunit isn't so classic.
It is a stylish movie, but the story is actually rather lame and unexciting when you take away the A-list actors and the glossy finish. Besides, a few key scenes don't really make sense, but have to be that way because the plot wouldn't work otherwise (meeting dangerous people in dark alleys instead of crowded places type of stuff).
It was also impossible to miss the racial undertones. The makers of the film were obviously drawing a metaphor for the demographic shift in America, clearly expressing their satisfaction with a certain majority being on the way out. (Once you see the final scene you'll know what I mean.)Bottom line: You can watch it and you won't get bored, but don't expect too much."
"1072","Knives Out",6,"Good acting but otherwise boring","It is a beautiful and well acted movie. But this type of film is not my cup of tea. They managed to not make it feel too ""theatrical"" but still I felt that the characters were a bit ""plastic"" and the plot - ""who did it?"" - is not something I am terribly interested in."
"1073","Knives Out",1,"Socialism throughout vomiting","Why defenders of this film can't understand simple fact: people JUST get tired from unnecessary POLITICS in EVERY mediocre entertaining film. And this guy have his 1/10 not for Last Jedi, but for this cheap political pamphlet with direct offense to American majority, like we don't have already infamous Red Hollywood, and now they go again. I am from country with socialistic regime and this rhetorics will lead only to oppression of some classes. And then! I am telling this about that detective movie? YES! Its real shame that in 2019 we can't go to movie theater and don't get bunch of political statements in our faces. Maybe ratings of this film make them producers think that short-term cash-grab on liberal zoomers is really short-term. Or maybe we will get somedays some MPAA film rating system that include POLITICS in film and get for that R. Because they deserve it for propaganda to the children. Maybe I see the day when all Disney fosterling get their R-rating for propaganda and strong political themes."
"1074","Knives Out",1,"Don't waste your time or money","Knives out has to be the shallowest stupidest movie ever made. They just want to ca$h in on holiday money. Terrible plot, bad acting, but what do you expect with a dumb whodunit."
"1075","Knives Out",2,"It's finally over","This film went above and beyond. It sucked for 2 hrs and 10 minutes. A whodunnit where the viewer is hardly involved, just presented sterotypes of outlandish people (get ready for SJW speak and the naïveté that comes with the extreme left). Everyone's repulsive, except for the Colombian maid whose purity rivals that of the baby Jesus. Like I said, you just watch the narrative unspool, but it's no fun because you're not given enough character development for the viewer to turn into a participant. Screenwriting seems to be a lost art form, more and more. The last 15-20 mins of the movie is nothing short of the detective telling the viewer and other cast members who did what to whom. It's essentially what should have been the pitch for the studio, but instead of turning it into a film, they just let Daniel Craig explain it all in one breathless and BORING ""finale"". The Neverending Boring. Like I said, it sucked for 2 hrs and 10 minutes. You'd expect a better climax."
"1076","Knives Out",1,"Tedious","Possibly the most tedious movie I've ever seen. Nothing happens!"
"1077","Knives Out",6,"Overrated..","So not a bad movie but I don't see what all the hype was about..
Daniel had the worst accent.."
"1078","Knives Out",6,"Passes The Time","""Knives Out"" is a perfectly entertaining, perfectly agreeable little film, a star-studded old-style murder-mystery that's good fun while it lasts. The actors involved all seem to be having fun and the plot keeps you engaged, even right up to the reveal when you will, as can often happen with these things, find yourself saying, ""Oh, so that's...hang on, that doesn't make any sense"". For indeed, plot and motivation holes abound and ultimately you're left with a decent film (although some might find the lie/reflux plot point a trifle irritating). It's fun enough, the kind of film best watched after Christmas lunch with the family, but it's not a game-changer in any way."
"1079","Knives Out",10,"Incredibly complex whodunit","Knives Out is an incredibly complex whodunit that skillfully subverts expectations, switches between multiple genres easily and effectively and only gets better with multiple viewings. It's also surprisingly extremely funny and expertly paced. All of it's incredible cast are excellent but Chris Evans, Daniel Craig and Ana De Armas give the standout performances. Rian Johnson's direction is incredible and the film is extremely well filmed. The music by Nathan Johnson is fantastic."
"1080","Knives Out",6,"Disappointed","What a waste of a stellar cast. The trailer shows almost all the scenes that the famous people are in together. The rest of the time you are watching a little known Cuban actress who is apparently the star of the movie. It's hard to believe that this is the same writer/director as Brick, which is one of my top 10 favorite movies. This movie doesn't have nearly as much sly humor as that movie. It's not particularly witty and it's not really a sendup of the genre, either. Not a complete waste of time, but not what I was hoping for either."
"1081","Knives Out",1,"Painful and Predictable","Some people love it some people don't. I don't. Found myself embarrassed for the actors and lack of writing."
"1082","Knives Out",1,"Mistery murder? What misery and what murder...of cinema.","Where do we start?
Ah yes, "" I hated every minute of it but cannot be bothered to watch it again to understand why"", paraphrasing the genius of ""Yesterday"" masterpiece by Mr Danny Boyle.
A needlessly convoluted plot with literally hundreds of details which add nothing to the movie, there is even a useless car chase for no reason other than stretch the time of the movie. Badly written and directed, wasting a cast of almost 'have been' A listers and the APPALLING performance of the Idiotic Creole/ British Columbo put forward by a out of his depth mr Craig... wow I cannot see him sinking any lower than this. The few exceptionally brilliant dozens of seconds that Christopher Plummer appears in this movie do not redeem a confused script and story line that makes little sense and makes the performances of anyone else in the movie seem amateurish at best. I cannot see any reason whatsoever to give this ""thing"" more than one star. Avoid without looking back."
"1083","Knives Out",4,"Like an episode of Murder She Wrote with added 'comedy'.","This big-name cast overacts its way through this lame excuse for a whodunit. You would think that this writer/director would have learned his lesson after The Last Jedi, but the identity politics are here, front and centre.
The plot itself is not that great. The whole purpose of this genre is to keep the audience guessing until the denouement, but even half asleep I had figured out who the baddie was and had more or less unraveled the plot. Johnson is no David Mamet.
This picture tries to capture the smartness of an Agatha Christie novel or play like The Mousetrap or The Mirror Crack'd from Side to Side, with the upper crust players, the old house, a will reading and the cliched characters. Each of the suspects is from the imagination of someone obsessed with the 'basket of deplorables'. Every one of them has a flaw that makes them impossible to like, all are bigoted and avaricious when pushed out of their comfort zones. The main character, on the other hand, is so pretty and pure and perfect and kind. She's one big liberal stereotype, which is ironic, considering that the actress almost turned down the role because she felt it was too stereotypical.
Daniel Craig just plods through the picture with a pretty poor southern drawl.
I hope the film gods put an end to Rian Johnson's career sooner rather than later. How many disasters does it take before they wake up?
Rant over."
"1084","Knives Out",6,"It's an ok movie","It's an ok movie for a mystery lovers, the only
part that was really annoying was that Daniel Craig accent..
wtf? So he tried it and at some point
someone should have told him no, just no."
"1085","Knives Out",6,"Not this much","I'd such high expectations on this title and I've got very disappointed when it got to the ending and was unsurprisingly bad.I was base myself to IMDB ratings and at I'm
still don't get why people give good notes to Knives Out.Pass this one out if you can."
"1086","Knives Out",6,"Decent, nothing great.","I don't know if it was the hype that got my expectations too high or the fact that the mystery whodunit genre is something I love but this movie just didn't deliver as expected.I kept waiting for the movie to pull me in but it just never did. The actors were decent so it wasn't really an acting issue. Overall I felt the movie was celebrating its own cleverness the entire time. Of course when you celebrate your own cleverness it usually means you're not half as clever as you think you are.I understand there were some sociopolitical undertones that meant a lot to some folks. The sociopolitical commentary was less than subtle and pretty much just ended up being virtue signaling. Still, I won't stop anyone enjoying their game of wokemon and I know wokemon is important to Hollywood right now so ... whatever on that.Had the mystery whodunit aspect been really well done then this would have been a far better movie."
"1087","Knives Out",2,"Misunderstood political agenda","Here goes Rian again on his ""I know best"" agendas, last time ""toxic masculinity"" this time ""white privilege"" well asians earn more than white people Rian, I don't see you bashing them.1 extra star because past this idiots political agenda smoothed movie there is actually the resemblance of a good movie"
"1088","Knives Out",1,"Not good!!!!","I love who done it movies, but this one bored me. Daniel Craig had no presence and his fake southern accent was insulting.Not worth bothering with. I wonder how many of the 10 star reviews are from the people that worked on the movie."
"1089","Knives Out",1,"Extremely overrated and pretentious crime mystery","Wow I must just hate Rian Johnson after the Last Jedi but this film was so long in the tooth. Absolute no care about any of the characters. They are as boring as paste. I have no care about the story and do not see any draw towards Daniel Craigs forced accent. No one speaks that deeply of a drawl from the south come on now. This was a real disappointment and try it if you have time to waste thats all this is."
"1090","Knives Out",NA,"Wast of time.","I read through a lot of user reviews after seeing this today because I couldn't believe the high rating which is why I saw it in the first place. Seems like a lot of people don't like the director because of a Star Wars film he made. Well I'm not a fan of Star Wars and I can tell you the only thing this movie has going for it is a somewhat enjoyable first 20 minutes plus it seemed pretty to look at. That's all. My 10 year old daughter could have written better dialogue than this. I could see the guy sitting next to me getting very agitated about half way through so I asked him is he ok. He said to me
""What the hell is this I'm watching,""
I am not sure I would even recommend this for streaming considering how much good content there is out there."
"1091","Knives Out",7,"Disappointing but still enjoyable","After having seen all of Johnson's movies except for The Brothers Bloom I expected something a little bit more from Knives Out. A more mature, cold film with it's tounge in cheek is what I wanted after previously enjoying Brick and Looper so much. I was at least very happy to see it put a curious twist on the murder mystery genre. The story takes a very different path than I expected. Sadly, it seems as though they could have gone in harder with this twist, it goes back to the usual motions after a while.As it is this has to be Johnson's most accessible movie yet. It's a star-studded cast filled with old reliabales and also some newcomers. Though I don't feel as though the actors were given very much time to properly shine it's all very lovely and nice. The high saturation and crazy colorful sets should grab the interest of most viewers aswell, though I do find the cinematography quite formulaic.If you're looking for a nice family film you can take your children or parents to you're sure to have a blast. If you're looking for anything like Johnson's earlier work or something more artsy however, you'll be disappointed."
"1092","Knives Out",3,"A 45 minute mystery","A 45 minute mystery stretched out for two hours! You can figure out who's innocent within the first 30 minutes! This story is so 'actuel' the political/social overtones are unpalatable to the plot. If the average viewer fails to notice this - then they are in a coma!Plot - a death has occurred in a 'manifest destiny mansion'. And Daniel Craig as inspector 'Benoit Blanc' is hired to investigate. (Personally I think Craig is being groomed to be the Louisiana version of Hercule Poirot). But that phony southern drippy bougainvillea accent is very nerve wrecking. Please don't!The mystery is good but the process to solve it is needlessly long."
"1093","Knives Out",NA,"Not nearly as clever as it thinks it is","Smarmy, arrogant, condescending, and not anything close to being as clever as this film *thinks* it is. You know within 5 minutes, another movie made by a demorat elitist. Some decent performances to be found, hence the 3 stars. Some actors highly under used (lookin at you, Chris Evans). I would say it's mostly a waste of time. It's plots don't twist. The 'whodunit' factor never really comes into play. And when the movies reaches it's climax, like most women who date weak willed, vegan men....you're left thinking, ""is that it?"" as you wonder off to the bathroom, alone, to finish what was started. My advice? Skip it and save yourself the disappointment."
"1094","Knives Out",2,"What? 10? Had high hopes for this, a real drag!","This is the first time I've been compelled to write a review of a movie on IMDB. I was excited to go to this the day after Thanksgiving on the rare day off. When I say it was a real drag it's because the pacing was horrible absolutely boring at times you've been a somewhat strong finish couldn't help it, it was so predictable. A fine cast couldn't save it. Watch Murder on the Orient Express instead."
"1095","Knives Out",4,"Lame and tiresome","I love mystery stories. I adore Daniel Craig. The writer of this mess, not so much. Don't understand why it is so overrated. Ooohh, big surprise ending. By the time he gets around to it, don't much care. Why bother to make Craig assume the bad accent as it adds absolutely nothing to the plot or character. I've read so many better books, why not make movies out of them. Read Nesbo, see Headhunters. Now That has plot twists."
"1096","Knives Out",5,"It was okay","So I don't get the hype. I didn't think it was that great. There wasn't much to it. Doesn't make you laugh, no suspense, not very entertaining either. Seems like they filmed it in a day or two. There was no connection going on between any of the characters besides Christopher Plumer and his nurse. If it's free I'd say watch it but wait till it comes out on Netflix."
"1097","Knives Out",5,"It was a solid OK","Nothing special, a few twists and turns along the way but it's a bit obvious who was the antagonist. I'll give you the final washout was different but IT wasn't too hard to know the final destination, just the how to get there but took a little to unfold but it wasn't the most shocking twist."
"1098","Knives Out",6,"Takes itself far too seriously and misses the boat","Disappointingly the all star cast don't really get much to do. This is really just a retread of an Agatha Christie Poirot story but unfortunately takes itself far too seriously to enjoy the ride. What could have been a rip-roaring Old-school who-done-it ended up being very flat. Did anyone care who did it? Surely it's all about the getting there?!"
"1099","Knives Out",1,"Dreadful","I thought it would be a witty dark mystery about Daniel Graig as a PI who solves a murder mystery in a mansion. But was wrong. The film has almost no mystery. Much of it takes place outside of the mansion. It focuses almost entirely on a hispanic maid in order to make a painfully obvious political statement about how entitled white people mistreat immigrants. That's it. That's the whole film. There aren't reversals more than props planted and then hinted at later. Plot convenience and terrible writing. The film doesn't even make sense. This felt like a bad draft. My head hurts now."
"1100","Knives Out",1,"Terrible movie","What could have been a good movie is ruined by the political nonsense. The trailers don't show you this, but it influences the movie in a big way to the point of being incredibly preachy and annoying like Terminator Dark Fate. If this bothers you, don't see it."
"1101","Deep Blue Sea 3",3,"A sad decline","Deep Blue Sea (1) was superb. But sadly it's fallen by the wayside since then and this third installment underscores that entirely.I desperately wanted this to be good, I really did, and watched with fingers crossed, but it's just poor. Weak story, awful acting, despite sharks looking good. It's not worth it, and a sad decline. It's a pity as lots of people are crying out for top quality shark movies."
"1102","Deep Blue Sea 3",6,"Why so much hate?","DBS 3 is what DBS2 should have been...it did something different and was an instant improvement over 2. The graphics and effects were better. I had fun with this movie!"
"1103","Deep Blue Sea 3",4,"Better than the second but fails with sloppy acting, writing, and terrible direction.","Deep Blue Sea 3 (2 out of 5 stars).Deep Blue Sea 3 is a sequel that is an improvement over the second movie. But still not better than the original. The plot follows a group of engineered bullsharks that are wrecking the ecosystem in a underwater haven which they have to stop.The plot is terribly put together. The script and direction is cheesy. The humor feels forced with its stereotypical characters. The direction is horrible. The cast ensemble is good but the performances are sloppy. The visual effects is cheap. It does have some entertaining action. But fails with its script and direction."
"1104","Deep Blue Sea 3",7,"Better than expected","Much better than expected and worth a watch.
this is a quality production with good actors"
"1105","Deep Blue Sea 3",2,"Not quite watchable","Glaring technical flaws come hard and fast. I went in expecting technical inaccuracies , but it was really bad. Bad swimming, bad boats, bad diving, bad robots. None of which could actually work as depicted. Especially the nerf guns that blow stuff up.Add to that some low B grade actors, bad cgi, and bad camera work.I won't pick on the bad plot, its a killer shark movie. Bad plot is expected.Do your self a favour and re-watch the original. Or if you want b grade. Try Sharktopus. I wouldn't even torrent this rubish."
"1106","Deep Blue Sea 3",4,"Well, its starting to get back on track...","Well, this movie came out of the blue, pardon the pun. I hadn't expected to see a third movie in the ""Deep Blue Sea"" movie series, especially not after the abysmal ""Deep Blue Sea 2"".So I sat down to watch ""Deep Blue Sea 3"" with very little expectations or hopes for the movie, given the previous movie. But still, it is a shark movie, so of course there was a chance of it being good. And I do like creature features.Turns out that ""Deep Blue Sea 3"" definitely was a step up in the right direction, as it proved much more enjoyable and entertaining than the 2018 ""Deep Blue Sea 2"", but still it wasn't as good as the 1999 first movie ""Deep Blue Sea"".The storyline in ""Deep Blue Sea 3"" was enjoyable enough for what it turned out to be. Sure, it was generic and predictable, especially as shark movies go. But still, it was fun enough to watch. Just a shame that the sharks didn't really have that much screen time or played too big of a part in the movie. I watch these movies for the sharks, not for the dubious characters in the movie.""Deep Blue Sea 3"" had a fair enough cast of actors and actresses, however there weren't any familiar or famous faces on the cast list, for better or worse.If you enjoy generic shark movies, then ""Deep Blue Sea 3"" is worth a watch. Keep in mind that this is by no means an outstanding or memorable movie. My rating of ""Deep Blue Sea 3"" is a four out of ten stars."
"1107","Deep Blue Sea 3",6,"It better than 2nd one","Tbh it is so much better than the second one, CGI quite neat tho"
"1108","Deep Blue Sea 3",3,"Decent Effects, Insufferable Characters","Lovely locale and competent Shark CGI gets bogged down by main characters so dislikable it's distracting. I started praying for Emma and Eugene to be eaten as soon as they stuck their toes in the water for the first time. Everyone, save for Richie and Lucas (who are supposed to be the bad guys) have a massive chip on their shoulder - and it gets old fast."

so we initially see woman in the sea with a great white shark , hitting it on the nose as you would do a puppy for wetting your carpet! then the shark pushes her into a coral, she bleeds and nothing happens!
there is a sea station, like a floating village, the roofs are made from palm leaves, never have i known palm trees growing up out of the ocean thousands of miles from land, fresh veg and food aplenty on this man made plot, runnig fresh water the lot! it is just so unreal and unbelievable!oh then the casting, wow wow wow wow, the famous 5 are all here, white jock, white grumpy woman, black guy with a vest on, the intelligent asian and the camp vegan! im all for diversity but why do we HAVE to have the stereotypical 5 in every movie? these people wouldnt cross paths!!!so we move on to diving in wet suits amongst massive big sharks who are obviously not hungry!
oh dont bother with it , its pathetically awful!
this is the a lame effort, the worst movie of 2020 by a long way! AWFUL!"
"1111","Deep Blue Sea 3",2,"Just watch Sharknado instead... you'll thank me later.","And that's from someone who dislikes discount Star-Lord (Ian Ziering) and loathes nearly all things made by The Asylum. Or better yet, just watch the first Deep Blue Sea and pretend that none of the others exist. This movie is just so incredibly boring. The pacing is stilted with long stretches of underwater scenes as the main protagonist tries to deliver her environmental messaging. I wasn't expecting high cinema, but this is a complete dud. None of the characters are likable, the dialog isn't engaging, the CGI is only passable, and you don't even have a mascot to provide a distraction. Not even the tough-talking, shark-punching, self-empowered, and environmentally-aware female researcher running around in her swimsuit adds anything to this opus. And yes, identity politics are in play here since none of the men or women know how to relate to each other -- either as co-workers or antagonists. There's no playful banter, no real scientific exploration, no suspense -- just tired social media tropes and cliched characters. And when you see who survives to the end, it will make you cringe."
"1112","Deep Blue Sea 3",1,"Really really hard to watch.....","When people say that there is good acting in this movie, they must be trolling right? After trying to watch this for an hour I just want all the actors to be eaten by the terrible cgi sharks.

"1130","Deep Blue Sea 3",6,"Definitely for Deep Blue Fans","We've got a whole cast out of the C list. Mostly unknowns, but that's not a bad thing. Especially the lead ""Doctor"" who looks quite exotic and must be known for some of her popular series', like Lost. I'd never seen her before. Across the board, most of the acting is a bit wooden, and we didn't always remember our lines, did we. Nevertheless, the photography was great, including the underwater portions. Not quite as sharkcentric as the iconic 'Deep Blue Sea' (1), and certainly not the budget, but just enough tie-in to keep it legit, and a lot of similar set-ups (see: formulaic). I liked it, and it deserves better than the 4.6 is currently has. I'm guessing too many DBS 1 purists and maybe some non-sharkaholics contributing. You know - for the life of me - I can't remember DBS 2. Must have been very unmemorable. I may have to revisit."

It's the second sequel to a movie where smart sharks eat dumb people, what are you expecting? It's awesome! The first one is great, the second one is unwatchable, this one is pretty cool. Has dumb moments, of course, but overall very entertaining."
"1133","Deep Blue Sea 3",2,"Deep Blue Sea 3 is like Jaws.","Deep Blue Sea,like Jaws, was great,but just like Jaws the sequels continue to degrade till all that's left is to watch the sharks swim & eat the cast.
Amazing how boring that can get.
So like Jaws just stick to the original & remember to stay clear of the real ones."
"1134","Deep Blue Sea 3",9,"Solid and impressive sequel effort","Working on a remote research facility, a scientist and her team researching the effects of climate change on local sharks are approached by an old friend to help him track sharks that have gotten loose, but when they learn the true nature of his visit are forced to battle several dangerous threats to get away alive.There was a lot to like with this effort. One of the strongest features here is the fine setup that provides a fun throughline for what happens here. The early series of exploratory measures around the facility showing their research into sharks and the community they have together is nicely off-set by the sudden arrival of the hunters looking around for the missing creatures serves to introduce the two groups rather well. Realizing the differences in their approach creates an intriguing storyline where everything is worked out early on to not only know who they are but weaves the rest of the franchise together. As well, there's a lot to like here with the realization about the threat posed by the sharks. The initial underwater sequence where the discovery of the dead sharks and the spectacular reveal about the deceased crewmember gives us quite a nice sequence, while the hunting sequence later on where they manage to capture the one shark to begin studying it offers several fun action scenes showing off the danger posed to them by the sharks. Several other fun scenes, from the sharks attacking the ship to retrieve the captured shark, the spectacular shot of the shark jumping out of the water to grab a victim jumping from a ship into the water or leaping out of the water to grab another victim brawling on the shore makes for a series of fun attack scenes. The last positive here is the rather fun and frantic final half that turns the film into a solid action-packed outing. With the decision to go for the switch involving who the real villains are, there's quite a lot of action throughout here which isn't usually present here as the gun battle that destroys a major part of the facility, several hard-hitting fist-fights and various other encounters throughout the facility all while trying to avoid the killer sharks circling around keep this one fun and quite thrilling. The battle to finally stop the sharks is enjoyable as well, getting several small confrontations to get each shark under control, resulting in some decent gore and a clever enough method to finally defeat the final shark which goes alongside the passable practical effects to hold this one up. There aren't a whole lot of issues to be had here. The biggest flaw is the wholly unrealistic storyline about the secrecy of the project which gets incredibly frustrating how shortsighted this is. The idea of ignoring orders and doing everything for the betterment of the company, which includes killing eyewitnesses and making out for the money would've been fine without several speeches about the shifted allegiance and the right thing to do that none of it makes any sense for the motivations to do so. On top of that, this series of allegiance shifts takes away a minor threat posed by the sharks in order to deal with that instead which is quite unimpressive to downgrade the sharks. Alongside the somewhat obvious CGI which isn't too bad but stands out in use, there isn't much wrong with this one.Rated Unrated/R: Graphic Violence and Graphic Language."

Enjoyable, but cheesy.And in an era of so many super-cheap Asylum shark movies, it would seem silly for legacy movie studios to put money into shark movies.But apparently Warner Bros made enough money with Deep Blue Sea 2 and The Meg to warrant putting actual money into Deep Blue Sea 3.There's a ton of underwater scenes of people diving around this beautiful coral reef.

Its not on the same level as the original but its a worthy sequel with some great shark scenes and some good acting by the stunning , almost painfully beautiful Tania Ramonde.. She really carried most of the movie and brought a surprising gravitas in her role ...She isnt the little girl from Lost anymore, but has matured and its shows in her acting and what she brings to the table...The other lead actor from ""the originals"" did a fine job as well...This is a lower budget version in the trilogy so dont expect things on a grand scale but there are many thrilling moments and Tania is just a treat to watch! A fun movie that does very well with what it has!"

This did not happen on the third. Oh, they really nailed this, the characters were well rounded thanks to great character interaction, an interesting story and setting this story in a different culture. There are so many interesting subtle additions to this film that the writers have added that it would make a post about 1000 characters long, which I don't have the energy to produce lol. A pool of really talented young actors, a director who nailed it, and obviously a team who had a lot of fun and motivation. I don't know who did what, but it totally worked! Nice work!"

All and all I enjoyed my ride with Deep Blue sea 3. The under water scenes are breathtaking and Tanya Raymonde is one talented actress, I love her in Golioth and think she is going places but Lord hear my pray that was a very intense scene with Bren Foster (Lucas) he look as if he is one strong man that went from good guy to bad guy! I'm a Wolfstrong fan from the Last Ship and watching him turn from good guy saving the world to Bad guy broke my heart at first BUT then by the end of the film I was mouth open in shock! And now im unclear if I want to keep him as a good guys Hero or a Bad guy mean guy. I loved Reina Aoi, how smart she is but also how sweet she is- this was a great role

I think this is an enjoyable movie and has quite a lot intense moment.The only complaint for me is when the Shark appear as CGI, it isn't hollywood level. However, when they use 'model sharks', they can still look pretty scary.For me, it is already one of the best Shark movie in recently one or two years. So, if you like Shark movie, you can give it a try."

Cheap CGI graphics for the shark that don't quite follow basic rules of physics, and a lot of melodrama between the team actors. Most of the actors are no names and none of them can act.My guess, the producers of this film were pinching pennies to complete this forgettable film."

"1158","Deep Blue Sea 3",4,"Not as good as the original but not terrible","Obviously the original was the best. But this sequel is watchable and special effects ok. The sharks look real enough but they're not particularly menacing like in the first Deep Blue Sea. Granted it doesn't have the budget of the original or the Meg but at least it doesn't look cartoonish. Though with advances in CGI I would've hoped it was at least as good as the original even without the budget. The story is kinda flimsy which is to be expected as it's hard to come up with anything fresh for a shark movie. But that's ok you don't watch a shark movie for story or science. You wanna see giant sharks do their thing and sharks are given some screentime. Without the budget you don't see the sharks as often as the original and the sharks aren't as big and scary but at least the CGI renders look realistic. Overall it's not too bad even if it's not nearly as thrilling as the original. It should satisfy fans with a shark craving."
"1159","Deep Blue Sea 3",7,"If you have high expectations for any sequel, you're the problem... this was fun.","I expected this would be really bad, but to be honest, it's well shot, the acting was good, the story implausible, but it's sci-fi, so WTF? The CGI was ""meh"", but not overtly bad, and there was a couple of laughably bad moments, that, I'm sorry, made the film fun, and I really enjoyed this as a check-your-brain-at-the-door viewing.The worst thing I can say, is that if you're going to barely cover Tania Raymonde's tattoos, but your intent is to cloak them entirely, spend a little extra on CGI budget to eliminate them entirely."
"1160","Deep Blue Sea 3",6,"interesting to say the least...","I went in expecting it first to be awesome, then slowly realized it would probably be trash, but it wasn't! there was some good acting, i dont know why everyone is saying its trash. some effects looked decent to good and it looked a lot more professional than the  stain that was deep blue sea 2. the villian was okay, he was too generic and had really no personality and he had this stupid looking gun and kinda died really stupidly, twice, you'll know what im talking about if you saw it. i actually liked some of the characters and was a little sad when some died but not crying, and it was enjoyable at parts. but the pacing was weird. it takes really over an hour and 10 minutes for any shark stuff to happen and its mostly short and way too brief. really there's only 5 or so minutes or sharks in the film doing cool things so they really aren't a threat or at least not a lingering one. 50 minutes of the film is building characters and having the villain just beat up people, its kinda lame. i wish there were more sharks and also better characters cause that helps in any movie. also the effects sometimes look like ass, mainly the sharks most of the time. sometimes they look really good or like i said decent, but mostly really bad which is confusing as this film had a decent budget of 5 million dollars.
overall, worth a watch, not the worst thing ever but not nearly as good as the original.

"1164","Gone with the Wind",10,"The tragedy of Scarlet the wise 2020 review","At first you would think, the main theme of the film is the horrors of war and the idea that both sides suffer , but that is not the only case in ""Gone with the Wind"", the war is just a background...
Scarlet lives almost her entire life in an illusion of love... She has a target she want to achieve and she thinks if she achieves it she will be happy, while missing the point on the way to that target... Something that I realised on a 2nd viewing is that Scarlet is a pretty selfish person with sociopaths behaviour. She can easily manipulate men and sometimes women in order to achieve her goal. She can kill a person and not feel that bad about it,she can exploit prisoners rather than hire free men. The goal is what pushes her forward and sometimes makes her do good things, but these deeds are never done out of big heart, they are usually done in self interest. You would think she ends up achieving everything she wanted, but she does not. Scarlet lives in a personal hell which partially she created herself and only when the last obstacle to her big love, the female friend that loves her is gone, she realises that all this time, she lived the illusion of love, she was hurting the people that loved her. Is scarlet a horrible person? Probably... Does she pay for her sins? She does more than anyone... Does she understand what true love is? Yes in the end she does... What makes this film so great, it's a tragedy like ""War And Peace"" with monumental character development ...Any scenes of war and racism fade compared to the tragedy of Scarlet which lives in personal hell..."

"1167","Gone with the Wind",10,"Scarlett's So High Spirited And Vivacious","Before I ever saw Gone With the Wind, I was well acquainted with Max Steiner's theme. It opened WOR TV's Million Dollar Movie before every broadcast in New York in the Fifties and Sixties. When my parents took me to see Gone With the Wind in one of MGM's re-releases as the film music started in my youthful eagerness to show off my knowledge I remarked to all who could hear that that was stolen from Million Dollar Movie.Million Dollar Movie is gone now, but Gone With the Wind, book and film, remain eternal. In these days Margaret Mitchell's southern point of view book might have trouble finding a publisher, let alone selling film rights to the story. But it is a tribute to her and the characters she created that they remain alive in everyone's mind who reads the novel or sees the film. And that's just about the same because I can't think of another film that remained so faithful to the text.It is said that Margaret Mitchell wrote the book with Clark Gable in mind as Rhett Butler. As the sober and ever realistic, but charming Rhett, Gable for most of the film is playing a character not to dissimilar from what he usually played on screen. However in the last half hour of the film when he's hit with unbelievable tragedy and he edges to the point of madness, Gable reached dimensions he never did before or subsequently. If Mitchell knew who she wanted as Rhett, nobody knew who would be Scarlett. The search for Scarlett O'Hara is one of those Hollywood legends as every actress with the possible exception of Edna May Oliver read for the part. Gone With the Wind started filming without a Scarlett as the famous burning of Atlanta sequence was done first. While it was being down, David O. Selznick settled on a fairly unknown British actress, at least in the USA, Vivien Leigh.It was a stroke of casting genius. Vivien Leigh's screen output is pretty small, she was primarily a stage actress. Gone With the Wind is more her film than Rhett Butler's. The story is her story, how she evolved from a flighty young southern belle to a hardbitten woman who is determined to survive in the style of living she's become accustomed to from the pre-Civil War era. In the process she helps all those around her economically, but loses all their previous affection. I've always felt the key scene in the film is after Leslie Howard tells Leigh, he'll be marrying Olivia DeHavilland and Leigh makes a fool of herself with him, she finds out that Clark Gable has overheard the whole thing. He's fascinated by her, but because of that he's on to all her ploys.Leslie Howard usually comes in for the smallest amount of analysis among the four leads. His Ashley Wilkes is not all that different from Alan Squire in The Petrified Forest. Imagine Squire as a wealthy plantation owner and you've Ashley. He's stronger than he realizes though, he's the one that reluctantly enlists in the Confederate Army while the cynical Rhett Butler makes some big bucks as a blockade runner.I've always felt however that the most difficult acting job in Gone With the Wind was the role of Melanie Hamilton. Olivia DeHavilland after initially considering trying out for Scarlett, decided to go after Melanie. It's a deceptive part, superficially it's a lot like the crinoline heroines DeHavilland was doing at Warner Brothers. Melanie is the counterpoint to Scarlett, an incredibly kind and decent soul who can't see bad in anyone. One of her best scenes is with Ona Munson who is Belle Watling, the most prominent madam in Atlanta. The other women of society snub her, but DeHavilland accepts her help for the Confederate cause. It's not about politics or slavery for Melanie, her husband is at war and his cause is her's.And DeHavilland's death scene would move the Medusa to tears. It's a great tribute to the playing skill of Olivia DeHavilland in that Melanie NEVER becomes a maudlin character. She got her first Oscar nomination for Melanie in the Supporting Actress category, but lost it to fellow cast member Hattie McDaniel as Scarlett's mammy.Hattie's a shrewd judge of character, she's a slave, but she's also a family confidante of the O'Haras. As Gable says, she's one of the few people he knows whose respect he wants.Of course Gone With the Wind is from the southern point of view. Growing up in Atlanta, Margaret Mitchell heard reminisces from many Confederate veterans and the stories they told found their way into Gone With the Wind. It's about what the white civilian population endured during the war and Reconstruction.David O. Selznick got a bit of irony in there though. Please note during the burning of Atlanta the slaves who are being marched out to dig trenches are singing 'Let My People Go.' And that's just what the Union Army was coming to Atlanta to do.Gone With the Wind copped so many Oscars for 1939 that Bob Hope quipped at the Academy Awards ceremony that it was a benefit for David O. Selznick. Of course it was the Best Picture of 1939 and Vivien Leigh won the first of her two Best Actress Awards.Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer kept itself in the black for years by simply re-releasing Gone With the Wind. Unlike any other classic film, it won new generations of fans with theatrical re-release. Somewhere on this planet there are people seeing this 67 year old classic and it is winning new fans as I write this.And I think Gone With the Wind, the telling of the interwoven lives of Rhett, Scarlett, Ashley, and Melanie and the world they knew, will be something viewed and read hundreds of years from now."
"1168","Gone with the Wind",10,"Georgia on my mind","This film shows the best of the American cinema. Whether we like the film, or not, one has to recognize the greatest achievement, perhaps, of the creative talent of the people working in the movie industry. ""Gone with the Wind"" represents a monumental leap, as well as a departure, for the movies, as they were done prior to this film.The vision of David O. Selznick, the power behind bringing Margaret Mitchell's massive account about the South, before and after the Civil War, pays handsomely with the film that Victor Fleming directed. This movie will live forever because it reminds us of how this great nation came into being, despite the different opinions from the two stubborn factions in the war.""Gone with the Wind"" brought together the best people in Hollywood. The end result is the stunning film that for about four hours keep us interested in the story unfolding in the screen. Of course, credit must be due to the director, Victor Fleming, and his vision, as well as the adaptation by Sydney Howard, who gave the right tone to the film. The gorgeous cinematography created by Ernest Haller gives us a vision of the gentle South before the war, and the Phoenix raising from the ashes of a burned Atlanta. The music of Max Steiner puts the right touch behind all that is seen in the movie.One can't conceive another Scarlett O'Hara played by no one, but Vivien Leigh. Her beauty, her sense of timing, her intelligent approach to this role, makes this a hallmark performance. Ms. Leigh was at the best moment of her distinguished career and it shows. Scarlett goes from riches to rags, back to riches again and in the process finds an inner strength she didn't know she possessed. Her impossible love for Ashley will consume her and will keep her away from returning the love to the man that really loves her, Rhett.The same thing applies to the Rhett Butler of Clark Gable. No one else comes to mind for playing him with the passion he projects throughout the movie. This is a man's man. Captain Butler was torn between his loyalty to the cause of the South and his sense of decency. His love for Scarlett, the woman he knows is in love with a dream, speaks eloquently for itself.The other two principals, Olivia de Havilland and Leslie Howard, give performances that are amazing to watch. Ms. de Havilland's Melanie Hamilton is perfect. Melanie is loyal to the woman that does everything to undermine her marriage to Ashley. Mr. Howard's Ashley gives a perfect balance to the man in love with his wife, while Scarlett keeps tempting him.The rest of the cast is too numerous to make justice to all the actors one sees on the screen, but omitting the contribution of Hattie McDaniel to the film would be sinful. Ms. McDaniel was such a natural actress that she is excellent no matter in what movie she is playing. This huge talent is a joy to watch.Comments to this forum express their objections to the way the race relations play in the movie, but being realistic, this movie speaks about the not too distant past where all kinds of atrocities, such as the slavery, were the norm of the land. While those things are repugnant to acknowledge, in the film, they are kept at a minimum. After all, this film is based on a book by one of the daughters of that South, Margaret Mitchell, who is presenting the story as she saw it in her mind, no doubt told to her from relatives that lived in that period of a horrible page in the American history.Enjoy this monumental classic in all its splendor."
"1169","Gone with the Wind",10,"A Potpourri of Vestiges Review: An American magnum opus which must be watched and often, and by those who understand cinema","Margaret Mitchell's Gone with the Wind, in its true essence, is a case study on the Old American way of living where pride and honor were the very essence of human existence. Victor Fleming's rendition of the classic novel, a classic within its own right, does full justice to the themes propagated by Mitchell's evocative masterpiece. In the words of Mitchell herself, Gone with the Wind is the story of the people whose gift of gumption gave them a definitive edge to endure the tribulation and throes of the American Civil War vis-à-vis those who lacked an inner resolve and determination needed for survival.Scarlet O'Hara, the well bred, haughty, tempestuous and opportunistic protagonist of the saga, is an ostensibly flawed individual whose inexorable urge to placate her ego and realize her fancies appears far stronger than her adherence to any credence pious to her people and relevant to her time. Her scintillating charm and unrestrained zeal not only make her an object of desire for her male counterparts but also an object of envy for the girls around her.Vivian Leigh perfectly fits into the caricature of Scarlet O'Hara. She makes full use of her talent, courage and guile to portray a part that requires subtlety, brusqueness and poise in equal parts. It may sound like a hyperbole, but no other actress seemed better equipped to play the part a southern belle than Leigh herself, who won not one but two Oscars while playing one: first for her portrayal of Scarlet O'Hara and second for portraying Blanche DuBois in A Streetcar Named Desire opposite Marlon Brando. In fact, her portrayal of Scarlet O'Hara, in which she perfectly blends panache, poignancy and peremptoriness, is arguably the greatest portrayal by a female lead in cinematic history. Leigh uses her on-stage experience to improvise in order to add new dimensions and complexities to Scarlet's caricature, which according to the novel was mostly one dimensional: out-and-out bad. Scarlet's stubbornness and her impish obsession for a conformist like Ashley, who is not only indifferent to her feelings but also incapable of reciprocating the passion and zeal with which she pursues him, represent just one dimension of her multifaceted self, which is revealed layer by layer with the progression of the narrative. The viewer is gifted to see Scarlet in various avatars: a usurper, an egomaniac, a damsel, a nemesis, a menace, a guardian, a savior, a patriot, a fighter and most importantly as a quintessence of womanhood.Clark Gable as Rhett Butler perfectly complements Vivian Leigh's larger than life portrayal. He is an outright reprobate, an unscrupulous opportunist whose life revolves around making money and pursuing carnal pleasures. However, behind this facade, just like Scarlet, there is a human capable of love, and worthy of being loved. These unobtrusive yet obvious similarities make Scarlet and Rhett a perfect match for each other. The subtle chemistry and tension between the two protagonists give the story its impetus and resonant charm. The rest of the cast has given exemplary performances with a special mention of Olivia de Havilland, who as Melanie is a paragon of love, humility and forgiveness. She provides a striking contrast to Scarlet's caricature and represents a more traditional picture of womanhood.The movie's direction, cinematography, editing and music are all top notch and it is the great synergy of all these elements that makes the movie an extravaganza and an undisputed master piece, one to be savored till eternity. The movie is an amalgam of scenes, high on emotion and drama, which keeps the viewer absorbed throughout. The scene in which Scarlet's father tells her the importance of mother land, deeming it as the only thing worth fighting for, is pure gold. Other scenes that come close to matching its brilliance include the one in which Scarlet performs the duties of an obstetrician to help Melanie give birth to her child, and the one in which Scarlet pledges to protect Tara till her last breath. The movie also has an amazing repertoire of dialogs that are delivered with a nice mix of finesse and accuracy. Butler's famous dialog in which he says to Scarlet, ""You should be kissed and often, and by someone who knows how,"" also happens to be one of all time favorite. The movie, especially its anti-climatic ending, brings tears to eyes and leaves the viewer overwhelmed as he experiences a rainbow of different emotions, being awestruck by the tremendous impact of the journey that he is vicariously made to undergo.PS. Gone with the Wind is undoubtedly one of cinema's greatest marvels and is a living testament to cinema's timelessness, and its limitless potential. A must watch for everyone. 10/10http://www.apotpourriofvestiges.com/"
"1170","Gone with the Wind",9,"Like the film? Read the book.","I've seen the film many times, have always enjoyed it. But I've been reading the book for the first time. It's a very long novel, and you have to stay with it if you want to see the ending. It's a good read, but Margaret Mitchell, former newspaper reporter, is very thorough in her description of both Southern culture and the changes that the Civil War brought to it. It's the size of the book that was the biggest challenge for David O Selznick. Not what parts to film, but which parts to leave out. So many characters that appeared in the book couldn't be introduced in the movie without extending the film's length to well over four hours. So he had Sidney Howard write the screenplay, then cut that down to a filmable length by hiring several more writers to further pare the script, and was still rewriting it himself while it was being filmed. Selznick was close to running out of money, so he asked his angel, millionaire Jock Whitney, to loan him enough to finish the film. The film was finally completed and edited, then was test-marketed at a theatre not far from LA. The viewers were excited about having seen it and said so on their preview cards, which allowed Selznick to rest easy, knowing he had a hit on his hands."
"1171","Gone with the Wind",8,"Even after years of being made.. it is good!","I wish people made more movies like this nowadays..Yes! The movie is LONG, but the development of the main character has you swinging from liking her to hating her, to agreeing with her, to.. all sort of emotions!! It is well worth anyone's time.
These characters feel SO real! It's like a perfect summarized soap opera. Anyone studying movie-writing should check this adaptation of the book. Would recommend to anyone.And make yourself a favor and don't watch the sequel.. the movie ends the way it does for a reason."

"1173","Gone with the Wind",10,"Gone With The Wind","Gone with the Wind is a superb piece of cinema shot in a beautiful way like no other film, a great story with amazing performances all around. A film about love, perseverance, deception, and tragedy. This film captures the pure attitude and idea of the south after the civil war and during the reconstruction period. It captivates you from beginning to end."
"1174","Gone with the Wind",10,"One of the Greatest","A perfect epic movie with a great story and a superb playing cast and one of the biggest productions imaginable. Like Ben Hur and War and Peace a classic for all eternity. A world is going down, a new world is rising out of the ashes of the gone - melancholy, fear, the sacrifice, and hope of a whole generation fighting and suffering in the Amercian Civil War. In our troubled times, where war and terror are present almost in every corner of our world and in times where the status quo seems to be a faster and faster-going constant stream and faster-going flow, where nobody can be sure or predict what the future ahead may bring to us, a movie more relevant than most people think."
"1175","Gone with the Wind",10,"Astounding Film - GWTW is the Definition of a Classic!","The setting is a Georgia plantation. The year is 1861, and sixteen-year-old Scarlett O'Hara is infatuated with the blond, drowsy-eyed Ashley Wilkes - the problem is, Ashley plans to marry another woman. Little matter that every other man in the county is courting Scarlett and that a charming scoundrel named Rhett Butler is staring at her with questionable intent - she cares only for Ashley.Suddenly, the Civil War brakes out, changing the fates and fortunes of all. Scarlett, clever, manipulative, and charming, proves an adept survivor - but what will she have to do to survive? And will she ever learn whom it is that she really loves?GWTW is one of the most meticulously cast films ever; with the possible exception of Leslie Howard as Ashley (in his forties, rather old to be playing a man half that age), every role was perfectly assigned. After you watch Vivien Leigh you will be unable to imagine anyone else playing Scarlett, and Hattie McDaniel's strong, unforgettable performance as ""Mammy"" netted her an academy award (the first for an African-American actor).
GWTW's backdrop is the gruesome Civil War, and in the end this film is the story a woman and a civilization (the Old South) going through a war that will not leave either of them unchanged.The cinematography is beautiful, memorable. Gone With the Wind was shot entirely in gorgeous technicolor; the scene of the fire in Atlanta required the use of all eight technicolor cameras in existence at the time.
The pragmatic may think Gone with the Wind overly dramatic; the restless may find it too long; the action-stimulated, too subtle. None of this, however, detracts from the fact that GWTW retains a lasting appeal as one of the crowning cinematic achievements of the 20th century. Those who see its ending as depressing - tragic, even - perhaps miss the point - which Scarlett O'Hara makes in her very last instant with us, tear-stained eyes uplifted in a sudden, curious burst of hope beneath all the turmoil; that .. . ""After all, tomorrow is another day."" 10/10"
"1176","Gone with the Wind",10,"The Greatest Film of its Time, and All Time","I believe that when one views a film, one should consider the context in which it was made.Barely 10 years after talking pictures were first created; less than that after the first full-length color feature film was created; near the end of the greatest depression this country ever experienced, and in which pretty much the only entertainment available to most was radio or the movies; David O Selznik decided to turn the biggest pot-boiler blockbuster novel into a movie.And what a movie. Stunning color, the most popular mail actor of his time, perfect music score, incredible action scenes, story line only 70 years removed from when it happened, and on, and on. Can you imagine what a store-clerk or a farmer, or a teacher experienced in that world, seeing Gone With the Wind? What was there to compare with? 1939 was a watershed year for great movies, and this one was the greatest produced. Try watching this movie as if there were no TV, no DVD's, only a few radio stations, spending maybe the second to the last quarter you owned, never having seen such a movie before, and you get what I mean. Masterful for its time, and still timeless today."
"1177","Gone with the Wind",8,"An immortal and towering achievement","It is always in people's nature to put down great things and to nit-pick or sometimes just be plain mean. No matter what anyone says, this is utterly fantastic: in story, in special effects, in casting (with perhaps the sad exception of Leslie Howard as ""Ashley"") and in captivation. Vivien Leigh is so powerful, passionate, magnificent and beautiful that you could watch it 1000 times on that ground alone. She brings something so convincing and human to the role of the selfish, spoilt Scarlett; the character is larger than life.Leaving Vivien's astounding performance aside, this remains a sweeping unrivalled epic. Watch it. Esther's rating: 20/10"
"1178","Gone with the Wind",10,"A Classic in the History of Movie-making.","Every time I watch this film, and I've seen it more times than I can remember, I'm always astonished by the freshness of the story, the power of the emotions it conveys and the beautiful, detailed images of a time long gone. That this film was made in the 1930's is almost incomprehensible to me. The challenges that had to be overcome in order to bring it to life must have been monumental. But come to life it did, and still does! A triumph of film-making ingenuity and genius, that will live on for many generations to come."

"1181","Gone with the Wind",10,"A Snapshot of History On Film","Th the story of the South and the Stiff neck society is perfectly isolated in film forever. This film is NOT about race, but about a period of TIME, a portrayal of the lifestyle of the South at that time. Rhett is a Profiteer, Scarlet a hopeless spoiled romantic, the upper crust despising a ""slave auction"" of white women to raise $ for ""The Cause"". And Hattie McDonald... the portrayal of a Loving, caring, nurturing outspoken mammy. (Which is a Derivative if MOMMY). This movie need be watched as an example of a Moment in time. Of an impolite society doing its best to be ""polite"" under false pretense. It HAS HISTORICAL VALUE. The costumes, the settings, the burning of Atlanta.
Margaret Mitchell had it right, this is an Epic story with which each subsequent viewing enlightens one on the understandings of human nature and self-determination. Hattie Mc Daniel is the best, Butterfly McQueen May have portrayed a stereotype... however we MUST view this story as an epic almost mythological tale of the beginnings of Civil Rights."
"1182","Gone with the Wind",10,"One of the all-time greats","As a millennial, it is important for all fellow millennials to remember to not watch this film from a 21st century perspective. In order to appreciate Gone With The Wind, or any old classic film, one must watch it from the perspective of the period it was filmed as well as the period it describes. Certainly, the portrayal of the African-American characters is very dated, but that takes nothing away from how these roles were performed. Furthermore, while most today would disagree with the film's sympathetic disposition towards the south during the Civil War, everyone can agree that Gone With The Wind does an incredible job of highlighting the monumental costs of a war - the loss of lives, the strain put on those left behind afterwards, and the horribly wasteful drain of resources, money, and emotion that a war causes for everyone involved.Another thing Gone With The Wind did extremely well was to abandon the traditional roles of heroes and heels and instead blur those lines, showing the good and bad qualities of every character. Clark Gable's Rhett Butler spent his entire life as a slimy, womanizing sleazeball, yet demonstrated numerous times that he has a huge heart. Vivien Leigh as Scarlett was a very selfish, crass, and heartless person, yet showed the strength and resilience to persevere through any hard situation thrown her way. Olivia de Havilland portrayed Melly as an incredibly warm, caring, sweet individual who cared deeply for everyone around her, but suffered from naïvety and an inability to truly care about herself. Just to note for Olivia fans, this role is a must-see because it was the first role that removed her from the standard ""beautiful girl pursued by the lead man"" roles that Warner typically gave her, and it truly gave her an opportunity to show off her acting chops like never before. Leslie Howard's Ashley was the strong war hero yet was too weak to fight off Scarlett's continuous tempting advances. Last to mention but certainly not least was Hattie McDaniel as Mammy. She may have been portrayed as an uneducated house slave, yet several times was the smartest character in a scene.There are a couple characters who could've been done better, though. Victor Jory was a brilliant heel character actor, and Jonas Wilkinson was one of the few true heels in the film, yet he was confined to just a handful of scenes and was quite insignificant overall. Butterfly McQueen as Prissy was insufferable. It's not clear who told her to act like that or why they did, but her lines almost exclusively consist of screaming and extreme overacting, and her scenes are extremely painful to watch. She does have one worthwhile moment in the film though - to avoid a complete spoiler, just watch her lips.Perhaps the most impressive thing about Gone With The Wind is the cinematography. The color is gorgeous, and the HD copies of the film available today make it look like it was filmed just a few years ago. The use of thousands of extras in the outdoor hospital scene was very impactful. The fire scene was absolutely brilliant. Long-distance shots are used perfectly throughout the film. If someone wasn't told what year this film was made, it is highly doubtful that anyone would guess it dates all the way back to 1939. It could easily pass for the 90s. It looks THAT good.Overall, this is one of the all-time greats of classic film. Gone With The Wind is a must-watch for all classic film buffs!"
"1183","Gone with the Wind",10,"Great movie even in 2020","This movie is 80 years old but gets better like vintage. Cant belive how good the cinematography is. The old south sets look great. Lefties need to loosen up and enjoy this movie for the romance and drama not focus on its dark period in history."
"1184","Gone with the Wind",10,"GREAT BALLS OF FIRE, it's terrific!","There has never been any movie in the cinema history that was more a legend than ""Gone with the wind"". It is undeniable that this movie contains lots of goofs, but, despite all this, it is a blockbuster and a real masterpiece. Completely NOT overrated.I love this movie. I can't explain why exactly. There are sooo many reasons. I first saw it when I was a little kid and still can't forget it. It's so special if you can return to movie even when you had seen it more than 100 times... And GWTW is this kind of a movie.In my opinion a movie can not be a good when the acting is not good. And there acting is great! Every character is portrayed so magnificently!I will start with the supporting players. Barbara O'Neil, though only 28 while filming, played mother of quite adult daughters. She was the Ellen Robillard Mitchell descirbed in her book: so stative, so smart, so lady. Thomas Mitchell should have received Oscar for his Gerald O'Hara portroyal, and I think he did not just because he won for ""Stagecoach"" that year. Scarlett's sisters are really well cast. But the best supporting performance of the film is this one of Hattie McDaniel's. She is simply magnificent, moving and unforgettable as Mummy. Just amazing.Many people claim that Leslie Howard did not fit the role of Ashley. They may be right in some sense, but let's think it over twice. Ashley was more handsome as Mitchell described him, but he was a dreamer who could not find himself in a new, cruel world. And Howard showed this quality as best as possible.Of course, Olivia de Havilland's performance of Melanie was as worth of Oscar as Hattie McDaniel's, but later on she was given what she deserved (Oscars for ""To each his own"" and ""The Heiress""). She plays Melanie with such a sensibility, but she manages to show her hidden strength, but not in a dominate way. Clark Gable was so unsure of his talent till the end of his life. I think that he was a great actor. He's so real as Rhett, and he has to play several dramatic scenes. And he does it perfectly-remember that playing those scenes, like those after Scarlett's miscarriage, needed acting talent. He's perfect. But, I won't hide my opinion that Vivien Leigh's Scarlett is the best and most powerful point of the whole movie. Vivien won the role when she was completely unknown. She managed to master the Southern accent as well. She did not play Scarlett. She WAS Scarlett. But only in this movie. She never acted any other character the same way. She is terrific and has all those features that original Mitchell's Scarlett possesses. I heard that she wanted to play the part exactly as Mitchell created it, and Fleming wanted her to play it just as a bitch, so they fought about it badly, but, finally, Vivien did a great work and her Oscar was something very obvious.If you love good cinema, if you want to see something moving and something that is not getting old, though almost 70!, do not miss it."
"1185","Gone with the Wind",10,"After all Tomorrow is Another Day! Tenacious South!","I am not going to write a review in a classical sense of things. this is a film which should better be watched than reviewed one thing i would like to say is that our hearts are very silly part of body we don't know the importance of people around us but we focus on some abstract ideal being who only lives in our mind. Human being is actually flawed creature, it is violent selfish and at the same time kind and compassionate animal that is beauty of film till the end you will never figure out who is hero who is villain."
"1186","Gone with the Wind",10,"Great movie. Campy. 1939. Fiction. Not a documentary.","It's not a documentary. It's a campy great classic movie filmed in the 30's. It's fiction. No reason for all this.Terrible what the Academy Awards did to Hattie McDaniel."
"1187","Gone with the Wind",10,"Gone with the Wind","Margaret (b.Atlanta) found a porcelain pin amongst the post-War rubble, cleaned it, set it on the mantel, began to dreaming, put it to words and called it Gone-With-The-Wind.What do you write about a 4-hr epic showcasing maybe the most beguiling leading lady (Leigh), commanding lead man (Gable), charming characters (Melanie & Mammy) in arguably the best film ever made? Whatever it is, you keep it under 3000 words.If you are of the politically-correct persuasion, have feelings easily hurt or think the Classics are just so much cinema snooze, don't bother watching. But if you have a warm heart, like it tugged on a bit, understand historical context, know the difference between a documentary and a movie, you'll find the time needed to drink-in this sweeping, familial Civil War drama is very well spent.It's clearly Scarlett's movie but it's the meaning of the Ashley character that makes it one of the most curious. Leslie Howard (d.43) had balked at playing the hesitant Wilkes who may be Mitchell's nod to Lee: Learned men clinging to a corrupt code of honor who struggle with divided loyalties, choosing state (VA) over nation (USA), Wilkes engaging the additional battle of love (Melanie) versus passion (Scarlett).Those today with a hidden agenda will have you believe in the absurd, that Producer Selznick, he of Jewish heritage, sought to sentimentalize or make monument to the CSA and slavery. The plain truth, easy enough to see by those who watch film with an eye for entertainment and art, is that David O, along with directors Fleming & Cukor, elaborately portray the pain of life and circumstance, a treatment for which the pharmacology industry holds no monopoly of patents but for which movies offer some relief.And if you've a boycott bee in your bonnet, consider, when Rhett and Mams mix n' mingle over bourbons (2 hours in), the makers are firing one of the early shots for Civil-Rights. Does Gone-With-The-Wind romanticize events? Of course it does (""Cavaliers""), and that's why it's called cinema (4/4) (2.24.20)."
"1188","Gone with the Wind",10,"Fantastic Dramatization of the Civil War","I watched this movie for the first time at fourteen years old. I enjoyed it immensely. I have always been a fanatic for anything Civil War themed, so when my mother recommended it to me, it was a yes from the start. The opening scenes show the young Scarlett O'Hara as she awaits her father's arrival. Beloved in the eyes of all the men in the county, Scarlett has acquired a high self-esteem, but when the War is announced to come after all, the high-spirited Scarlett soon faces obstacles that are determined to destroy her faith and her hope. She meets many people along the way, she even gets married. With new relationships, new responsibilities come as well. Rhett Butler, a man determined to have Scarlett for his own, comes into her life half way through both the novel and the movie, and he fights her on topics such as love, politics and societal roles. Even after the Civil War, Scarlett is still faced with many decisions. She has faced death, marriage and defeat many times. Still willing to go on, even when it seemed impossible, Scarlett leaves us with the last quote of the novel and book, ""After all, tomorrow is another day."""

Me and my girlfriend decided to see a movie and chose this one not knowing anything about it. We sat in the balcony and was immediately captured by the music, characters, story-line and each other as we watched what we thought was a memorable night out together. Unknown to me, when part one ended I thought the movie was over and remarked boy that was good but I wonder what happened after that. We got up to go and found out it was only intermission. I cannot describe the feelings of joy knowing there was more. We were not disappointed either. When it ended I felt totally satisfied and changed forever more. A great movie with my future wife locked into each other for our lifetime. Since then, I have seen this movie so many times never tiring of it. I bought the collectors sets (vhs) and finally the DVD. Just finished watching it again loving every moment until the end. Will I see it again? Why not after all tomorrow is another day....Good movie to eat with while watching"
"1190","Gone with the Wind",9,"Clark Gable's Rhett Butler portrayal was amazing","Gone with wind -1939Well, Mr. Trump, except for historical misrepresentations, I liked the movie you like.The futile chasing of love. There been this plot in lot other movies that within 80 years. But this pleased me most. Unlike Casablanca, that plunged me to sadness.
Immoral but Clark Gable's, Rhett Butler was pleasing. I adore the character. An unlikely protagonist and a usual protagonist as a support actress was ironically fresh to my eyes, no, this is not like All about Eve.About land and honour when the movie speaks, there is a failure of depth to explain it."
"1191","Gone with the Wind",9,"Epic portrait of narcissism","While Scarlet faces some rough times ahead in her life in the upcoming Civil War, she is by far privileged... Blessed with inherited wealth, fair skin, good looks, and a loyal family... She has everything in life... Or so would seem.In reality, Scarlet is living lesser as a human than her own slaves, who are about the only somewhat believable humans depicted on screen... For Scarlet is absent of humanity, love, and all the immaterial genuine human connections that makes a life worth the struggle of living. She is doomed to forever look upon what she does not have with envy, and for what she does have, with resentment.It can certainly be said this film glosses over the harsh realities of the American South under the slave system... The times are depicted in such fervour romanticism that it becomes absurdly comical. This is a work of romantic fiction however, so it need not be historically accurate. It need not teach the audience any moral message, if anything its sheer politically incorrect attitude is a refreshing sight to behold. This feature, unintentionally amusing, makes the film even better and fits seamlessly with the kind of personalities shown on screen.The acting is truly stunningly sublime, Vivien Leigh portrays her character with relentless perfection... She completely encapsulates in her performance the portrait of a tireless narcissist-plagued by unrequited infatuation... Acting as arguably one of the most insufferable characters of all time. I detract one star from the film only for its drawn-out length, which makes it very difficult to watch in one sitting. Overall however, the film is a cinematic masterpiece, with every scene masterfully crafted into a heavenly romanticized motion-picture landscape."
"1192","Gone with the Wind",10,"I will not be putting this film down!","I am disgusted by the comments of some of the users on this site who claimed Gone With the Wind is racist, who claimed that Scarlett is nothing but an arrogant b****, and so on and so forth.First of all, of COURSE this movie is racist. It was taken from a SOUTHERNERS point of view during the Civil War. The movie was not being racist on it's own saying that slavery should still exist, it was simply FOLLOWING the book. It is ridiculous to claim otherwise.Second of all, Scarlett was portrayed as a conniving, ""vile"" woman. However, she DID love Rhett...and of course she didn't love Ashley- that was pointed out in the movie and the book that it was an infatuation, she simply wanted what she ""couldn't have."" Perhaps the author wanted to display how Scarlett blooms. One must remember that in the beginning of the book Scarlett is only 16. She is not an adult, she is a spoiled girl used to being a Southern belle. She may be sassy and audacious but she has grit. By the end of the movie/book for those who MISSED THIS WHOLE POINT. Scarlett realizes she loves Rhett and she realizes her wrong doing. If you read the book and watched the movie ""Scarlett"" you would watch her progress even further into womanhood. Scarlett was proving feminism (taking matters into her own hands) long before the idea ever broke out. It seems to me that those who disliked the book would make a point that proved they just didn't get it. I'm not sure if they are used to cut and dry movies and books...but for crying out loud...expand your minds. The movie may not be the best acted/directed/whatever, but remember how early on this movie was made...it's not going to be today's Hollywood. But the story is timeless and incredible and BRAVE. It takes on the viewpoint which no one wanted to admit was out there. Bravo!"
"1193","Gone with the Wind",10,"A great American classic","'Gone with the Wind' is one of the greatest American classics ever made. It tells the story of Scarlett O'Hara, played the very beautiful Vivien Leigh. She is one of the most selfish heroines you will ever see in a movie and still care for her. She is in love with Ashley Wilkes (Leslie Howard) but he marries to Melanie Hamilton. She is played by Olivia de Havilland in a great performance. A new man in Scarlett's life is Rhett Butler (Clark Gable) but Scarlett does everything to get what she wants including marrying someone for money and her own benefit. Rhett loves Scarlett with all his heart, mainly because they are much the same. They both think the world is there for them. Melanie and Scarlett become friends.The movie is set in the time of the Civil War. What happens exactly with Scarlett, Rhett, Ashley and Melanie is for you to see but the war is pretty important for the story and the way it is used is great. The story itself is great anyway. Although the movie is long it is never boring. A reason for that is the performances. I already mentioned Olivia de Havilland, Clark Gable is very good, charming and sometimes funny, Hattie McDaniel as the black made is outstanding but I have to say that the best thing in this movie is Vivien Leigh. To make you care for a character like that is a pretty hard thing to do, but she makes it seem so easy. It is one of the strongest performances I have seen.Besides the story and the acting we have the music, the sets, the costumes, the cinematography and of course the direction. It is all great. It was made in 1939 and over 60 years later it still is a very impressive movie."
"1194","Gone with the Wind",10,"65th Anniversary DVD is a must","If you have ever considered GWTW to be less than a masterpiece, you'll be swayed by the 65th Anniversary Edition DVD. The 4-disc set features the remastered film and more extras than you could possibly watch in one day (after watching the film, of course). The two-hour making-of documentary is fascinating and shows how the producer (David O. Selznick) of the film affected the cast, director(s) and writer(s) -- and shows the publicity frenzy that was the hunt for Scarlett. The feature of Olivia De Havilland (in 2004) discussing her role as Melanie is a real treat. The picture and sound are great on the 65th Anniversary DVD, and the special features are a true treasure. Accept no substitutes, seek out the 65th Anniversary DVD and bring it home."
"1195","Gone with the Wind",10,"Forever classic","The film presents a very unusual love story on the magnificent era picture, creating a love epic film with a real and vast historical background plus a fictional character story. The film retains the charm and depth of Margaret Mitchell's original works, with both colorful scenes and detailed portrayals of the fate of the characters. Whether you think of Shakespeare or vulgar soap opera, the film has achieved amazing artistic achievements. The heroine is not a ""good woman"", but she has the toughness that many men may not have, as if nothing can defeat her. She can always find a fulcrum and stand up again, just as she always remembers in her ""Tomorrow is another"" day ""."
"1196","Gone with the Wind",10,"Love enlightenment","Maybe every girl has an ashley in her heart. but it takes time to find out that true love is Rhett"
"1197","Gone with the Wind",10,"Loved this movie!!","When I first got this movie, I was a bit skeptical. I'm not a huge fan of war based movies, but I was pleasantly surprised. Gone With the Wind was a beautiful movie that so clearly showed the devastation of the Civil War and how during the Reconstruction the Southerners had to adjust to the abolishment of slavery. Although there are racist undertones and many of the African American characters are stereotypes, one has to take into account the time the movie was filmed and released, and the time it is depicting. The romance element of the movie helps keep it interesting, and the movie perfectly balances romance and the Civil War aspects of the film. All in all, this movie was amazing and I can see how it is one of the greats."
"1198","Gone with the Wind",10,"When men were still men.","Before I watched it I had heard so many times about how fantastic this movie was. I've always thought it was a kind of a cliché that people felt the need to say just because everybody did. Now I can say that it really is good. It's simply a masterpiece and probably one of the greatest movie of all time. It's hard to explain why it's so good... It just is. Everything is just perfect from Vivien Leigh's excellent performance to Clark Gable's. The bravery and toughness showed by Scarlett O'Hara is what we need to see more often on screen: strong female characters."
"1199","Gone with the Wind",10,"Magnificent Movie!","I watched this movie last night after not having seen it in many years. Even though I have seen this many times in the past, I was bowled over by the quality. From the beautiful cinematography to the rich characterizations and the wonderful acting, this movie is Hollywood at its finest. Scarlett ""over-the-top"" character is played wonderfully by the beautiful Vivian Leigh. What more can be said about Clark Gable's masterful performance? There is also a great supporting cast. Love it, love it, love it."
"1200","Gone with the Wind",9,"Timeless classic that never gets old!","Gone with the Wind is one of my all time favorite movies. It is a classic story of romance and the struggle of loving and being loved. My mom, sister, and I have watched this countless times together and it never gets old. The movie wouldn't have been successful without its stars. The main characters, Scarlett O'Hara, played by Vivien Leigh, Rhett Butler, played by Clark Gable, make the movie. They fell into the roles as naturally as breathing. The chemistry between the two makes their love story real to the audience. The struggle in the love relationship between Scarlett and Rhett begins when Scarlett is spurned by Ashley Wilkes, played by Leslie Howard, the man she set her sights on to marry. She finds out that he is to marry his cousin Melanie, played by Olivia de Havilland, and Scarlett does not respond well to his rejection. Scarlett is a spoiled belle used to getting her way and she doesn't realize that she and Ashley are not alone in the scene where he rejects her. Rhett is asleep on the couch and awakens when she throws a vase at the wall in anger. From here on, Rhett and Scarlett engage in a game of cat and mouse throughout the movie. There are not many other movies to compare this one to. The only one that I can say even compares would be North and South. It is set during the Civil War, just as Gone with the Wind is. North and South showcases a well-known actor, Patrick Swayze, who plays Orry Main, the main character in the movie. It is a love story that also shows the struggles in life and relationships that people faced during the Civil War, much like Gone with the Wind. I feel that Gone with the Wind is definitely the better movie. Although it came out in 1939, it was way ahead of its time. The way that Tara was portrayed as a mansion, with its expansive lands and cotton fields made me want to live there. The lighting that was used in scenes helped to convey the feeling of the characters. For example, when Scarlett and her sisters had to work the fields, the lighting was dark and dreary. It effectively conveyed the feeling of despair and helplessness that they were all feeling. Another thing I noticed was the camera angles. One particular scene which stuck in my mind was when Scarlett was in Atlanta. You can see the destruction across the city. There are bodies lined up in the streets. The camera pans out and in the corner you see the rebel flag flying. I think that seeing that the flag was still flying after such destruction and loss was amazing. Gone with the Wind is a timeless classic that reassures me that in the worst of times, people still find a way to fight for something they love."
"1201","Gone with the Wind",10,"Shines brightly through the ages","Gone with the Wind is appropriate for those 12 and up. If I could have given the movie a 20 out of 10, I would. 1939 was a golden year for movies with both Gone With the Wind and The Wizard of Oz. Color scenes in Gone with the Wind were hand painted movie frames. The era of royalty and nobility in America gave way after the Civil War to democracy and freedom. Yet, dreams still exist. The number 1 and number 3 movie phrases of all time are in this movie. I for one have used both. Vivien Leigh and Clark Gable are both so good in this film that if all the other characters messed up, they alone would carry the movie. Leslie Howard depicts the nobility and royalty of the South, who, when the war was lost, he too was lost. Clark Gable portrays the ultimate survivor and realist. Vivien Leigh plays a character who is in love with the dream, yet has to become a survivor at great personal cost and learning too late what is truly important to her. The director leaves out one-half of the book. Yet, he produces a wonderful, classic movie. If it weren't for the intermission, the movie would be too long. Everybody should see this movie at least once. I think I have seen this movie more than a dozen times. I fall in love with this movie with each and every showing. Great romantic movie. It was a great day for movie lovers when Margeret Mitchell was on the train and met a book publisher. Gone With The Wind is a story which will shine brightly through the ages."
"1202","Gone with the Wind",10,"Gone With The Wind: My First Time View","Producer: David O. Selznick
Director: Victor Fleming
Writer: Sidney Howard
Stars: Vivien Leigh, Clark Gable, Leslie Howard, Olivia de Havilland, Thomas Mitchell, Hattie McDaniel
3h 58min Drama, History, Romance melodrama.Gone With the Wind. My new number 1 Greatest American Movie (followed by The Godfather, Ben-Hur , Casablanca, Taxi Driver, Star Wars , Citizen Kane , Rebecca).""Gone With the Wind"" presents a sentimental view of the Civil War, in which the ""Old South"" takes the place of Camelot and the war was fought not so much to defeat the Confederacy; as to give Miss Scarlett O'Hara her comeuppance. The tainted nostalgia comes with the territory. Yet as ""GWTW"" approaches its 81th anniversary, it is still a towering landmark of film, quite simply because it tells a good story, and tells it wonderfully well.Vivien Leigh stars as Scarlett O'Hara. In Gone with the Wind, She is always after something. She is fiery, stubborn, beautiful, and selfish, and won a Best Actress Oscar for her portrayal. When Scarlett O'Hara raises her fist to the sky and vows never to be hungry again, not only do we believe her, we understand her. Vivien Leigh's Scarlett , is one of greatest , most moving and varied , performance I've ever seen on the screen. A touchstone of great melodramatic acting. Rhett Butler is played by Clark Gable, a mustached, cocky, manly actor. Although Scarlett is the center of the film, Gable's intensity matches Leigh's. His ego seems to be competing with hers, physically wrestling hers on the screen. Their energy and passion rise up to meet the gigantic film. The supporting characters are lovely, too, especially Oscar winner Hattie McDaniel as Scarlett's Mammy. She steals every scene she's in with her explosive line readings, and her compassion.
five-time Oscar nominee Olivia de Havilland's performance as the moral fiber of society, was absolutely compelling and as beautiful as see is.Tremendously impressive cinematic experience. From the amazing performances to Fleming's incredible direction and awe-inspiring images and music. This is a film that deserves to be experienced. A time-tested favorite,""Gone With the Wind"" 10/10Trivia about Gone With the Wind:The four principal stars were billed in this order: Clark Gable, followed by Leslie Howard (as Scarlett's obsessive love, the glum Ashley Wilkes) and Olivia de Havilland (as sweet Melanie Wilkes, Ashley's cousin), and then Vivien Leigh last with ""...and presenting"" -- that is, until she won the Oscar and it was changed to ""starring.""The film (originally rough-cut at 6 hours in length) was challenging in its making, due to its controversial subject matter (including rape, drunkenness, moral dissipation and adultery) and its epic qualities, with more than 50 speaking roles and 2,400 extras.Adjusted for inflation, no movie can match the $3.7 billion haul that Gone with the Wind's $390 million box-office receipts since its 1939 release would be worth in today's dollars. The film currently remains the box-office (Champ). Yes More Than #2. 1. Avengers: Endgame (2019). Box office: $2.796 billion.A nationwide casting search for an actress to play the Southern belle Scarlett resulted in the hiring of young British actress Vivien Leigh, although over 30 other well-known actresses had been tested or considered including: Katharine Hepburn, Miriam Hopkins, Susan Hayward, Loretta Young, Carole Lombard, Paulette Goddard, Margaret Sullavan, Barbara Stanwyck, Joan Crawford, Norma Shearer, Lana Turner, Joan Bennett, Mae West, Tallulah Bankhead, Jean Arthur, and Lucille Ball. In all, 1,400 actresses were interviewed for the part of Scarlett O'Hara, and 400 performed audition-readings. Although MGM star Clark Gable was expected to play the role of the dashing Charlestonian war profiteer Rhett Butler, Errol Flynn, Ronald Colman, and Gary Cooper were also considered for the part.The landmark film received tremendous accolades, more than any previous films to date: thirteen nominations and eight (competitive) Academy Awards, including Best Picture, Best Director (Victor Fleming - the only credited director), Best Actress (Vivien Leigh), a posthumous Best Screenplay (Sidney Howard, along with collaborative assistance from Edwin Justin Mayer, John Van Druten, Ben Hecht, F. Scott Fitzgerald, and Jo Swerling) - the first post-humous winner of its kind, Best Color Cinematography, Best Interior Decoration, Best Film Editing, and Best Supporting Actress (Hattie McDaniel - the first time an African-American had been nominated and honored) and two honorary plaques, one for production designer William Cameron Menzies for the ""use of color for the enhancement of dramatic mood,"" and the other a technical production award for Don Musgrave for ""pioneering in the use of coordinated equipment.""Many of the five nominations that lost were unexpected: Best Actor (Clark Gable who lost to Robert Donat for Goodbye, Mr. Chips), Best Supporting Actress (Olivia de Havilland who was competing against co-star Hattie McDaniel), Best Sound Recording, Best Original Score (Max Steiner), and Best Special Effects. Its record of a total of ten Academy Awards wins held firm until 1959, when Ben-Hur (1959) won eleven Oscars. It was phenomenal that Gone With the Wind did so well, given that 1939 boasted some of the greatest American films ever made, including Ninotchka, The Wizard of Oz, Wuthering Heights, Mr. Smith Goes to Washington, Goodbye, Mr. Chips, and Stagecoach."
"1203","Gone with the Wind",10,"The definition of a classic","Over the weekend I was given the opportunity to see Gone With The Wind in theaters with my parents for its 80th anniversary. It's kind of embarrassing to me that I, a self-professed lover (and at this point addict) of cinema, hadn't yet seen a movie that is universally considered one of, if not THE best American movie ever made. Part of me had always been turned off by its 4 hour runtime, as I am in college and don't often have the time to sit down and watch a movie in a single 4-hour sitting. But another part of me had shied away from Gone due to all the blatant racism in it that I had been warned of. I had wasted my time watching D.W. Griffith's epic The Birth of a Nation and did not want to sit through another slog of a film that is great technically but ruined by its subtext. So when I sat down in the theater I was hesitant but excited. And yes, Gone With The Wind is undoubtedly racist, but it is also so much more, and the fact that it can be both great while having all of its apparent flaws is the very reason why it is undoubtedly a classic.
The first thing that struck me about the movie was just how gorgeous it was. The painted backgrounds, the costumes, the set designs, all of it was just so intricate and colorful. Even now thinking back on it Gone might be one of the top 10 or so best looking movies I have ever seen. I especially love the mind boggling scale of the sets of Atlanta, especially that long sweeping shot that moves back to seemingly show endless miles of soldiers laying wounded on the ground. The juxtaposition of the bloodied soldiers mixed with our main character wearing a beautiful dress is poignant, and it is definitely one of the greatest images in any movie ever made. From a technical standpoint, the only thing I really dislike about this film is two or three scenes with really bad looking rear screen projection, which is honestly more a of a nitpick seeing as just about every movie back in the day used rear screen projection or something of the sort. I guess those few moments just stick out worse when everything else is such an unblemished visual delight.
What really blew me away though, and what makes this movie a true classic that will remain ""ageless"" is the strength of the writing. This movie was so dark that I could not believe it was made in 1939. How it managed to sneak in things like rape and on-screen child death through the censors of the time shocked me, and I'm sure was even more shocking for the audiences at the time. Besides dark moments, the story as a whole hinges on a very psychologically unhealthy romance between two characters that are just plain bad people, and are never really painted or made out to be anything else. Our main character, Scarlett O'Hara, is surprisingly deep and nuanced. Being a woman in a ""man's world"" she uses all the tools at her disposal to get what she wants. She seduces men she has no feelings for and uses them and their wealth to get what she wants. She is cruel and uncaring; she doesn't shed a tear for her two husbands that die and uses unwilling prisoners that she allows to be abused as essential slave labor to run her business (though the movie makes sure to point out that they, of course, treated slaves so much better than these men and their slaves just loved being slaves so much). Through all of this though, she remains likeable and I found myself time and time again routing for her. Her vow at the end of the first half of the movie to ""never be hungry again"" is one of my favorite movie monologues. She starts out as a bratty and selfish little girl, and ends the movie is a strong and unbreakable woman. Her love interest and eventual husband, Rhett Butler, is an equally complex and flawed character who grows throughout the film. He's a womanizer who routinely is found at a brothel, and overall is just sort of an a-hole, although he's quite the charismatic a-hole. At his lowest point, he accidentally pushes pregnant Scarlett down a set of stairs and inadvertently kills their unborn child. After this he becomes a bitter man who, fueled by jealousy and depression, turns into an alcoholic before finally leaving Scarlett. Throughout all this he time and time again shows himself to be a redeemable and somewhat chivalrous character, as hypocritical as that may seem. He goes to fight a battle for the South just because he sees it as his duty and nothing more. He saves the man who Scarlett loves more than him just because it is the right thing to do. Overall the interactions and broken romance between him and Scarlett makes up the crux of the story, and these interactions are about as complex as the characters themselves are. They are both also played wonderfully by actress Vivien Leigh and actor Clark Gable who, while not reinventing acting like Brando, are both amazing in their own rights, especially for the time.
However, like I said this film is undoubtedly racist. The ""maid"" in the film, who is simply a house slave in the vein of Samuel L. Jackson's character in Django Unchained, is essentially a racial stereotype (like every black character in this film) who speaks in ""jive"" and is played for comic relief. Still, her character is legitimately funny and her actress Hattie McDaniel truly plays her well and gives her a deep emotional range that makes her a better character than she seems to have any right to be (McDaniel ended up being the first African American to win an Oscar for acting for her role in this film). Other scenes allude to some of the major characters being part of the KKK and going on raids to ""clean up"" areas of lawless criminals AKA poor black people. The second half of the film is even a tirade against Northerners and Democrats o as Gone sees them as: carpetbaggers. Throughout the film every aspect of the Deep South is romanticized to the extreme. Yet, none of this could detract from the overall film too much to me. Just like McDaniel's character ""Mammy"" is likeable even though she's inherently flawed in the way she is written, so is this film. I can't ignore this film's ignorance, but I also won't let it damper this masterpiece for me.
Some of my other flaws in this film that don't really have to do with racism are as follows: Prissy is the most obnoxious character I have ever seen. Besides a few comical moments that somehow work, she's beyond annoying and her loud voice constantly sounds like nails on a chalkboard for the few scenes she's in. Sometimes the pacing also isn't great, and a couple of times before the intermission I found myself a little board. That's honestly about it. Sure the acting isn't great from lots of characters, but that's just a product of the way acting was done at the time. Now, what else do I love that I haven't mentioned? I love the score. It's just simply fantastic and bombastic. I love the poster and want my sugar daddies out there to buy it for me. I love the complexity and ambiguity of the ending. Heck I even love this movie's love triangle. I love really everything about this movie. My gut reaction was to give it a 9 out of 10, but in the process of writing this I'm probably going to move it to a 10/10. There's nothing I can say about Gone With The Wind that has not been said millions of times before by people much more qualified than I, but I don't think it hurts for people to keep writing about this movie. Classics like this deserve to be written about and gushed over."
"1204","Gone with the Wind",10,"All Time Best Movie Heads South","For decades this picture remained #1 on virtually all lists of the best picture ever made as well as the all time box office champion. Suddenly though, the film's reputation heads South. I won't elaborate on the excellence or entertainment value because whatever I say you already know. GWTW was bounced off the box office list primarily because movie prices are never adjusted to constant dollars, thus the newest pictures always win. When GWTW opened in 1939, the admission price of $1.15 was so severe that some theaters had picket lines of protest. In 1939 a good middle class annual income was $800, so $1.15 was indeed expensive. Compare that to today's $10.50 and you see who wins. As to the film's reputation for excellence, this has been trashed in recent years because (1) the film portrays slaves during the Civil War era --- and this is shocking to the political correctness crowd; (2) the slaves act like slaves rather than acting like Snoop Dogg, Ice T, or even Sidney Poitier; another outrage to liberal censorship. The wacky left American Film Institute has thus dropped America's All Time Great Movie from #1 to it's current standing in the trash heap. Thinking people, however, still appreciate and love this classic. For the record, this picture was intensely popular with Black people when released in 1939, again in 1941, in 1954, in 1961 et cetera."
"1205","Gone with the Wind",10,"If you ever (thought you) wanted something you couldn't have, you need to watch this film","Gone with the Wind is a great visual spectacle, but that wouldn't keep people watching after 75 years if it wasn't for the timeless tales of three kinds of love - obsession mistaken for love (Scarlett for Ashley), sexual obsession turned to love for someone who doesn't reciprocate (Rhett for Scarlett), and true love with a barrier thrown in the way to prevent that love from being physically expressed (Melanie and Ashley) - the barrier being that Melanie cannot have another child without losing her life, and in the 19th century that means only one thing - no sex. Scarlett has it all - beauty, brains, and eventually, a husband who can keep up with her - the dashing Rhett Butler, whom she doesn't appreciate because - well - she has him. She wants what she can't have and has never had - the love of the rather drab and double-minded Ashley Wilkes who loves the not so beautiful not so clever and not so healthy Melanie. One thing that Melanie does have - great heart, and a belief in the honor of the people in her life, regardless of whether that belief is earned or not. The story is also one of transformation as Scarlett goes from pre-War southern Belle to hardened businesswoman post-War, in an effort to keep her family together and to keep the family plantation, Tara, out of Yankee and carpetbagger hands. Unlike her more genteel family and friends, who either lose everything or in one tragic case - her father - lose their sanity, she holds it together against forces she doesn't really understand and does whatever she has to do to beat the Yankees at their own game. But through it all she just can't get that unrequited obsession with Ashley out of her head, and that is more her personal undoing than anything the War did or ever could have done.This film is a demonstration of the best the studio system could do in that fabled year of 1939, and it showed that the studios had finally ""got"" putting together a costume drama that conveys true raw human emotions and reactions and even eroticism without crossing that pesky production code line. For anybody who has ever made a wrong decision in love that you wish you could do over, for anyone who has ever had their world suddenly change for the worse and had to adapt, I highly recommend this film."
"1206","Gone with the Wind",9,"Winds of war","The fact that as at my time of writing, ""Gone With The Wind"" stands only at number 152 in the best movie rankings of this site, I hope might be mainly attributable to the relative youth of the posters here. Here surely is Golden Age Hollywood's lasting monument to itself, which like another big-subject civil war movie from a previous generation (D W Griffiths' ""Birth Of A Nation"") while politically flawed in its treatment of black people, nevertheless stands as a significant and magnificent piece of movie-making.It's a film I'd dearly love to see on the big screen but all my viewings of it so far have been on TV which can't begin to do justice to the scale and colour of the achievement here. I know there's some contention about who directed which parts of it but I'm going to give my kudos to Victor Fleming who I believe did the lion's share of the work behind the camera. The sets are magnificent and the set-pieces even more so with several jaw-dropping scenes which are testament to artistic imagination and technical achievement in equal measure. Of course the two most celebrated of these I suppose are Rhett Butler's rescue of Melanie, Scarlett and Missy just ahead of the burning edifices of Atlanta and the rising dolly-shot of the wounded and dead of the Confederate Army as Scarlett seeks out Dr Meade. But let's not forget the acting too, especially the two leads who are both terrific, Gable, in his greatest role, is mean, moody and magnificent, while Vivien Leigh in her Hollywood breakthrough role is captivating as the wild, wilful and wonderful Scarlett O'Hara. While the characters of Ashley and Melanie Wilkes seem almost too good to be true (Ashley's guilty feelings for Scarlett aside), they are nonetheless beautifully played by Leslie Howard and Olivia De Havilland. Hattie McDaniel belies the racial stereotyping of her Mammy character to deliver an unforgettable, often scene-stealing performance. It is difficult today to witness some of the political incorrectness of the treatment given to the black characters, in the main shown as subservient, excitable and slow-witted, not sufficiently redeemed by their brave deeds in the film (Big Sam saves Scarlett from being raped, while Mammy effectively acts as the conscience of the film) and it is dreadful for modern ears to hear the ""d"" word spoken so casually if only sparingly.However I'm not going to criticise the movie for that when there's so much good to praise. It could be argued too that it's better up to the end of the war and goes a bit soap-opera-ish thereafter and the death-count starts to over-dramatically mount up towards the end, but such is the power of the film-making that it sweeps the viewer right along to both the central character's famous last words. By the time Max Steiner's famous theme plays over the final scene of the defiant Scarlett framed (has any film ever bettered the use of silhouette than this one?) against the burnt ochre sky, you realise you have watched something very special.Movie-making has unquestionably got bigger down the years, especially in the C-Gen, SFX-fests of recent times but I don't think any film will ever look or play better than this one. It's been many times said and written that 1939 was probably the year that more great movies came out of Hollywood than any other, but this one outdoes them all. And most other films since, come to that..."
"1207","Gone with the Wind",NA,"The Power and the Glory of Vivien Leigh","Any number of minor aspects of this 1939 release may seem ""dated"" by today's standards. But not Selznick's terrific sense of drama and certainly not Vivien Leigh's performance. Which seems eternally fresh, surprising, rich and compelling. One of the best times I ever had watching this movie was several years back when it was given a wide re-release and playing at a neighborhood theater on New York's west side. It was a midweek afternoon and a number of African-American schoolgirls had elected to play hooky and see it. They were completely enthralled, and the reason why was Vivien Leigh's Scarlet O'Hara. They were impulsive teenagers, and so was she. In fact Scarlet might best be described as the most formidable impulsive teenager of all time. Can't really be sure how much of the rest of the film got through to these girls, but they cheered Leigh on for whatever it was she wanted to do. And who can blame them?"
"1208","Gone with the Wind",8,"A Film of War Produced During Anxious Times","Since I initially wrote this review on July 8, 2016, there have been no less than 135 additional user reviews of this film in only three years and six months. Some of these reviews are good and some are terribly written with no actual explanation of the writer's rating or opinion. On the ""helpful"" list, this review appears as ""number 60"", at least at the moment, so I have no idea how any IMDb reader will ever find this addendum. At any rate, if you have any interest in this film, I highly recommend the documentary ""The Making of a Legend: Gone With the Wind"", directed by David Hinton in 1988. It offers a unique glimpse of how a movie is made, not just any movie but an exceptional movie.
I am now writing a separate review of that documentary, which mercifully only runs for about half of the running time of the movie itself. As I state below, my one criticism of the film is its unnecessarily long duration, especially the disappointing second half which fails to sustain the drama and spectacle of the first half.In my view, this movie is primarily about a catastrophic war, specifically the American Civil War, and it illustrates how this war so seriously impacted not only two extended families but an entire region, the American South. It is particularly significant to me that this movie, about the horrors of a major war, was made in 1939, a time when much of the world had already been thrust into another major war, World War II, and when many Americans must have been considering the consequences of our country's potential involvement in that war upon their own lives, upon their own personal situations. The world had become a very frightening place in 1939, and, although the United States had not yet entered the war, many informed, educated Americans must have been very concerned and even anxious about the very real possibility that the raging conflict overseas might one day arrive on their doorstep, including all of the uncertainty, disruption, and physical danger that would inevitably follow.Some viewers may appreciate the love scenes and the soap opera aspects of this cinematic epic, but what I find far more compelling is the dramatic circumstance of the characters who are suddenly immersed, some willingly and others involuntarily, in the middle of the bloodiest and most traumatic war ever to occur on American soil. I agree with other reviewers who wrote that the movie is too long. I believe that at least one hour could have been cut from it without destroying any meaningful continuity. After the explosive action of the first half, the second half appears somewhat anti-climactic and even boring for me.This movie is dominated by the central character of Scarlett O'Hara, so powerfully played by a stunningly beautiful Vivian Leigh. All of the other characters, especially the males, seem to pale in comparison to her with the exception of two of her slaves, played marvelously by Hattie McDaniel and Butterfly McQueen, who both manage to upstage Scarlett herself, which was not an easy feat. I realize that these were indeed tough times for the State of Georgia, and one had to be strong and determined in order to survive in such difficult circumstances, but did Scarlett have to be ruthless to the extent that she would steal her own sister's beau, a man she did not even love but decided to marry only on account of the economic potential of his hardware store, including its promising lumber business? Some may say that she only did this so that Tara could survive. Would that alone justify her callous, almost inhuman, behavior?The scenes of beaten, war ravaged Atlanta are very impressive, especially for their time, and must have been a daunting task for the director, Victor Fleming. Although the music and frequent scenes of blazing sunsets behind dead trees have become clichés in time, I think that they were much more effective before ""Gone With the Wind"" became such a widely familiar cinematic classic to us. In many regards, ""Gone With the Wind"" has become a victim of its own huge success in the way that its most famous scenes, music, and characters have become too familiar to us and the object of constant spoofing, satire, and even derision. What a shame.To me, this is a ""must see film"", not only for Ms. Leigh's remarkable performance but for the historical drama that is so effectively portrayed as the South becomes tragically victimized by the very war that many had initially glorified so unrealistically. The reality of war's horror, conveyed so convincingly in this film, is its most important message. A world in a state of peace and prosperity must never be taken for granted. No one would agree with this more than Scarlett O'Hara herself, a casualty of a major conflict that she never wanted in the first place. Of course, Ms. O'Hara would never allow herself to be victimized by anything or anyone for very long. In any case, ""she's not going to worry about that today. She'll worry about that tomorrow."""
"1209","Gone with the Wind",10,"Classic","I LOVE Gone with the Wind. It's a classic story with fabulous characters, awesome scenery, costumes and historical content. Everyone should watch it!"

the most remarkable hollywood movie ever made"
"1211","Gone with the Wind",9,"How do you rate a classic?","You have to acknowledge the grandeur and technical and logistical achievements of Gone with the wind. Even by today's standards the filmmaking is superb, let alone if you compare it to other films of the late 1930s.
Which leads to my question: can you watch this film today and rate it with a contemporary view on cinema? Or is it unfair to apply 21st century standards to this epic?If you take a look at it with a modern approach, it's not hard to see flaws:
it's very long and inconsistently paced.the views on slavery and the 'happy big black mamas' is dated and hard to bear.the (over-) acting looks fake.a spoiled brat is our heroine.Having said that, I still love this film. Seeing it is like coming home. Nostalgia is a powerful sensation and I feel it every time I watch it.In conclusion, I think Gone with the wind isn't a perfect film. But it is perfectly realized and can still warm your heart if you can switch off your 21st century views and ignore what you're used to seeing nowadays. Only then can you truly appreciate the film for what it is: a highly influential masterpiece."
"1212","Gone with the Wind",10,"Introduction of the Epic","This is perhaps the most classic movie ever made!! ""Gone with the Wind"" is always on every major critic's list of top ten movies in the history of American movie making!! So much of this film became an introduction to an onslaught of numerous elements of creativity to the American cinema!! ""Gone With The Wind"" was one the first recognizable color films in Hollywood!! Clark Gable's parting goodbye of ""Frankly my dear, I don't give a damn"" spurred on a nefarious notoriety which correlated to a very real aspect of candid expression!! This quote by Clark Gable has been voted by this website as the most classic line in the history of all movies ever made!! This ending line of his was considered very dare devil back in 1939!! By today's standards, of course, this seems ridiculous!! ""Gone with the Wind"" became a legendary favorite with the movie audience immediately, and it has been an all-time classic ever since!! The epic tale of Sherman's march into Atlanta at the end of the Civil War sparked a precarious nostalgia with the average American in 1939!! Scarlett O'Hara (played by Vivian Leigh) was a fickle and self serving Dixie maiden with a comical resilience!! Clark Gable was the straight forward southern gentleman who had to piece everything together!! Olivia De Havolind played Melanie, the bastion of hope for the faltering south. Lesile Howard played Ashley, Scarlett's true love!! Ashley was the man with whom Scarlett was fixated on!! Such a tale of morose, and flippant, intangibles, became a dramatic aspect to this movie!! This innovative genre easily garnered a positively peculiar camaraderie with the movie audience!! Margaret Mitchell's novel acquired a new found fascination with the American people when it got presented as this spectacular extravaganza of a motion picture!! ""Gone with the Wind"" won for best picture in 1939!! I have not seen ""Gone With The Wind"" in quite some time now, but, I did enjoy the film the last time I viewed it. The cast, the costuming, and the classic lines to this film are all first rate!! If you are interested in seeing one of the all time flicks in movie history, than, it is an absolutely must for you to see this film!!"
"1213","Gone with the Wind",10,"A True Classic","A movie should not be judged purely on its level of writing skill and overall deftness. For that, we have TV shows, which are more apt for this kind of judging alone based on their lower budgets and overall format. No, a movie should be to a large extent judged on its ability to take your breath away, to leave you as a different person than you were before and make you feel like you've gone on an epic adventure. That is why many of my favorite films of all time are epics.That is why The Wizard of Oz is not on my top 100 movies of all time list and this is. Strangely enough, those two movies form a dichotomy. TWoZ, with its color and fantasy plot, was a harbinger of things to come. This film, which is openly a wistful remembrance of the Antebellum South, was a send-off to the past.Yes, one could consider this film problematic for reasons, particularly racial ones, that I have absolutely no desire to discuss in the content of this review. I will just say that if you are going through movies that are artistic pinnacles yet troublesome when viewed with modern glasses, you could do a lot worse. Check out The Birth of a Nation if you want to see why. Still, say what you want against this movie in that regard.But do concede that viewed from an artistic viewpoint, the viewpoint that I always prefer to talk about a movie from, it is a triumph. A sweaty, bloody, four hour, epic triumph. When I watch this, I feel like I have been given wings and a time machine and told to just go. There is a reason this film has not inspired as much as did The Wizard of Oz. Actually, there are... quite a few reasons for that. But I'm talking about the scale. It's the same reason there are far more Potter wannabes than true LOTR wannabes. Whatever reasons you state, they do make a difference. The Wizard of Oz inspired many light fantasies to come. This didn't directly inspire very many notable films at all (with the notable exception of Barry Lyndon, but i'll talk about that movies creepy similarities to this one when I discuss the former).Combine that with the fact that three-hour-plus epics are as rare as dinosaurs nowadays, and you get a movie that is unique, different, and separated from the culture in which we know live. This fascinates me. Around the two-hour mark, when Scarlet rides off from a burning city, I felt emotions few movies have made me feel. Inspiration via the stunningly shot landscape, the best of many beautiful ones in this movie. A true sense of scale; the movie is only half over, but I get a feeling that I've been through so much already. Change; the winds of such were certainly in this scene. Romantic. Depressing. Hopeful. And wholly cinematic. It is the kind of scene that doesn't exist in film any more. The closest that you get is a television special. And if you can't find the beauty in that, ""Well frankly, my dear, I don't give a damn."" The characters are timeless. Clark Gable's Rhett Butler is suave and sophisticated yet fallible. I have seen many failed attempts to show a character like this, so it is refreshing to see it done right. It is like going to the mountains after driving through New Jersey. What so many movies get wrong about these kinds of characters is that they are not just striking and, for lack of a better term, cool. They are that way for a purpose. To use a common and only slightly disconnected example, people would not be such big Han Solo fans if Han was a construction man. Yes, that's more of an aesthetic analysis than a character one. But without aesthetic and presentation, there is nothing to wow our senses as our brain works through the plot of the film. And for this film, there is a lot of plot. What I love about these longer movies is that they don't end on the climax. Many moviegoers nowadays don't have the patience for this technique, but it's one of my favorites. If they made a four hour LOTR movie when it first came out, it would have had The Scouring of the Shire, one of my favorite chapters in it. But it is a good choice from a narrative standpoint as well. A story has five basic stages. Exposition, rising action, climax, falling action, and resolution. Many tales forget the fourth in favor of a snappy resolution. But it is my personal favorite step, one I like to call 'The Hero Goes Home' step. Rarely has it worked as well as it does in Gone With the Wind. You feel the entire plot arc of the main character.Who the main character is deserves special mention in my eyes. It is Scarlett O'Hara, a young Southern belle who has to adapt to a changing social climate. Even these days, a protagonist in an epic drama who is a female is rare. Even these days, a protagonist in an epic drama who is a villain or anti-hero is rare. Yet this film, released in 1939, not a year known for its liberated climate, had both. I don't know whether to applaud this film or tear down so- called modern film for this. Maybe I should do both. It certainly makes for a more interesting story narratively speaking. Scarlett is, in my opinion, the most interesting of a posse of complex characters.So ends this review. I sincerely hope it did not take you as long to read as it did to watch this movie. Now go forth back into your lives. Because tomorrow is another day."
"1214","Gone with the Wind",10,"Best Movie Ever Made","I'm a movie buff,so there are several favorites on my list but if a number one choice must be made then hands down it would be ""Gone With The Wind"" was, is, and will always be the best movie ever made. Ever since its premiere in 1939 ""Gone With The Wind"" was ahead of it's time and set the bar for all motion pictures after it. There would be no ""Star Wars,"" ""Ben Hur,"" ""Titanic,"" or ""Lord Of The Rings"" Trilogy if ""Gone With The Wind"" had not been such a grand achievement. Every frame of the film drips with sheer perfection. The sets are grand, the acting marvelous, and the direction impeccable. My favorite thing about ""Gone With The Wind"" would have to be the cast. Hattie MacDaniel was marvelous as Mammy, Olivia DeHaviland heavenly as Melanie, Leslie Howard great as Ashley, and Clark Gable is sheer perfection as Rhett Butler. Last but certainly not least, Vivien Leigh as Scarlett O'Hara.Every time I watch this film,and I've seen it more times than I can remember, I'm always astonished by the freshness of the story, the power of the emotions it conveys and the beautiful, detailed images of a time long gone. That this film was made in the 1930's is almost incomprehensible to me. The challenges that had to be overcome in order to bring it to life must have been monumental. But come to life it did, and still does! A triumph of film-making ingenuity and genius, that will live on for many generations to come.Footnote: I really enjoyed the sequel called ""Scarlett"" especially the climax. My sister encouraged me to watch but silly as it may seem I felt a sequel to this masterpiece was sacrilegious."
"1215","Gone with the Wind",9,"A classic that will last forever","I really enjoyed this film and found it to be very emotional at times.
However I wouldn't advise watching this whilst having friends over for a bbq and eating potato salad. Occasions like that should be saved for Virgins of Sherwood Forrest"
"1216","Gone with the Wind",10,"A great film rich in themes","Very great!!!Definitely a one-in-million film with perfect plot ,vivid characters and a tear-shedding ending.Through the story of Scarlett ,the film,I think, mainly puts forward a question of changing or not.As a matter of fact,Scarlett has always been a controversial character ,deplored by sooo many people.Be that as it may,I still think highly of her.Indeed.Imagine that era in which Sac lived!Throughout the Civil War,actually everything was changed.Turmoil,invasion,deprivation,robbery,arson...those bygone days were definitely nightmare for everyone,forcing them to make a choice between changing and being changed.However,only Scarlett had the courage to rise up against challenges.Only she dared to change herself in order to fight against the uneven and miserable life(in ironic comparison with Ashley who only wallowed himself in the past!)To change is to live!By all means!Absolutely Scarlett was the master of her life ,a great winner despite all her deeds.You can call her cruel, you can actually describe her as crazy,sly,uppity,but all these should be attributed to the era.(she might be a little capricious in the beginning though) .Scarlett just changed ,transformed herself to live through it,anyway.It's not her fault...She was also innocent.
By the way ,the ending in which Scarlett found her true inner self ,revealed the misunderstanding and expressed her deep love to Rhett is really really touching...Of only the story ended not in tragedy...."
"1217","Gone with the Wind",10,"A Stunning Masterpiece!","I've watched GWTW over the decades, and it's probably one of my all time favorite movies. Margaret Mitchell wrote the book after a car accident that disabled her for a period of time, never envisioning that it could be possible to make into a movie. It is full of wonderful actors, and the way Selznick filmed it, it's beyond amazing. Hattie McDaniel definitely earned her academy award, and was my favorite character!"
"1218","Gone with the Wind",10,"The best of the best","Time in movie history is measured before and after Gone with the wind ... Vladimir Serbia ..."
"1219","Gone with the Wind",10,"Still the best film ever made","This has to be my number one - sure, it's kitsch in places, sometimes it is like a bad soap, but its tragic, funny, romantic, epic and everything that has already been said.  I think the main four could not have been cast better and were probably giving their best performances (certainly it is on a par with Vivian Leigh's role in Streetcar and DeHavilland's role in Snake Pit).  Wonderful colour, music, atmosphere ... a four hour wallow I'd highly recommend!"
"1220","Gone with the Wind",10,"WONDERFUL MOVIE","I love this movie so much. It's my favorite movie.I am very grateful to the director, she found the perfect actress.No one is better suited for the role than Vivien Leigh.I love her!Her green eyes are so beautiful.I read the book first, so I am very grateful that the movie has a very high reduction.The movie realized my imagination of the scene in the book."
"1221","Gone with the Wind",7,"A classic of respectable scope, well ahead of its time","So, I've been calling myself a movie buff for ages, but it took me to get to the tender age of 23 to see one of the greatest classics in the history of cinema. I must say I was pretty impressed. The film has some outdated touches of the theatrical and romantic, but much less so than I expected. It's also interesting how the main character of Scarlett O'Hara- nicely portrayed by Leigh- is so very unsympathetic, almost an anti-hero. Still, Scarlet is a strong and interesting character who gains depth throughout the film. She goes from being a detestable manifestation of a privileged, unproductive lifestyle to an independent, even cruel persona full of determination and courage.This one was at its best when depicting the cruelty of the American civil war, when the focus of the story was less on relationships and more on the agelessly political."
"1222","Gone with the Wind",10,"THE Hollywood Period Classic Film","""Gone with the wind"" is the best story - the best book adaptation - the best classic film ever. I first saw it when I was just a kid, and I immediately fell in love with it. I re- watched it millions of times. And I still can't get enough. Scarlet O'Hara is one of the best film/book characters of history as she represents the spoiled flirty Southern Belle that - when in need - can react to destiny and war and fight like a tiger to survive. She is my idol. Strength combined with beauty, passion with a tantrum, shrewdness with sweetness. The only thing I hate about this heroine (apart from basically killing the poor horse when she finally reaches the ruins of Tara) is her blindness: she just cannot recognise Real Love and a Real Man. The book isn't altered too much, but something is different compared to Margaret Mitchell's masterpiece. However, the war and the slavery are well pictured, the intensity of the story and every single character is strong; the setting is just perfect, in particular if we note that this movie was made in 1939! I think ""Gone with the wind"" is the most genuine mix of love story, war narrative, great acting (the charming Rhett Butler played by the superb Clark Gable, the weak Melania played by Olivia de Havilland - the only living actor from this movie) and amazing music scores. It is definitely a must- see and the 220 minutes time just flies."
"1223","Gone with the Wind",10,"Great Epic Movie","I seen it once when I was much younger and did not understand it. Having seen it last year when I got the chance and again recently, all I can think is how superb this movie really is even today.
David O Selznick is definitely the Ridley Scott or James Cameron of his era! So detailed and so natural yet so delicate when it needs to be as if we are really there with the characters feeling the same. The story line adaption is truly superb as the cast members carefully chosen from thousands who auditioned.
Vivien Leigh and Clark Gable were perfect in their roles as Olivia De Havilland as Melanie.
The realistic ambient for each scenes were truly amazing which made it all so surreal for the story which is sadly lacking in a lot of movies today."
"1224","Gone with the Wind",10,"CLASSIC","It's a solid story, one of survival, love, loss, moving forward from the past, and coming of age. Characters are well developed, cinematography is thorough and the casting was great. Leslie Howard, Olivia De Havilland and Hattie McDaniel compliment Leigh and Gable very well. Speaking of the main stars, Leigh is beautiful and Gable is the type of man that is rarely seen in Hollywood nowadays, an old school smooth alpha. It's a film that deserves the term classic. Definitely a monumental achievement in the history of cinema."
"1225","Gone with the Wind",10,"Best Movie EVER!","This is hands down my favorite movie of all time. From its outstanding acting and directing to its ahead of its time cinematography and visual effects, Gone with the Wind is a truly amazing classic.

"1227","Gone with the Wind",10,"Small Moments","Some of the best moments in GWTW are small ones, some with no dialogue at all. I love the scene where Mammy is trying to get Scarlett to eat her breakfast before the barbecue, and gives her a dig about Ashley not proposing to her. The sideways look of death that Scarlett gives her, and her own smug expression when she knows she's won the exchange...brilliant. Also the scene at the barbecue just after she's overheard the other girls criticizing her, and she slowly climbs up the stairs, completely oblivious to everyone else running down the stairs around her whooping and hollering. And the scene at Aunt Pity's house on Christmas night where Scarlett stands alone at the bottom of the stairs watching Ashley take Melanie to bed was one of the few that made me feel sorry for her."
"1228","Gone with the Wind",10,"a huge film!","Excessive film, especially for this period ... The film that best represents the wild ambition of David O. Selznick, who offers us certainly the most beautiful pearl of the studio Selznick (King Kong, Rebecca,...) A colossal task and, despite a complicated development of the project and an organization not always rigorously (David O. Selznick), a great result on the screen.The restored version is gorgeous. One of the most beautiful restorations I had ever seen.A large mural on historical background of civilization off, featuring a heroine, or rather an anti-heroine, the unbearable pest Scarlett with a foolproof force that mature face of tragic events. Vivien Leigh, who live passionately Scarlett during preparation and filming, and certainly with the success long after ... I take comfort in that feeling ""Scarlett fascinated me (...), he would have had a good old spanking and I was delighted to give her this spanking. Pretentious and arrogant spoiled child (...) But she also knew how to show courage and determination ..."" Legendary figures, such as pure and delicious Melanie, played by Olivia De Havilland, through the almost extinct and anxious Ashley (Leslie Howard, like the feeling of the emerging World War II) Mammy, played by Hattie Mac Daniel won the first Oscar given to an artist of color, without forgetting the famous Rhett Butler Clark Gable.And even though today, for those who do not know, there may be some reluctance to watch it, because a large mural of classic movie attracts no more naturally today. But this film crosses generations, perhaps because it's just the story of characters with universal themes, which, live, love and try to survive this civilization gone with the wind.jeliosjelios@hotmail.fr"

So just watch it and be sure that you'll never regret seeing it because it's just unique! My vote is 10/10 because everything in this movie is so nice, the actors, their acts, the scenes, the dialogs..the story itself just so convincing and passionate!"
"1230","Gone with the Wind",10,"Worth a Peek","A long romantic-historical extravaganza, and the crowning glory of 1930's movie-making, the David Selznick Gone With the Wind is worth watching if only for the color and production design. The story is on the soapy side and concerns a Southern belle named Scarlett O'Hara, her obsessions, tribulations, her flaws and her (few) good points. I've never much cared for her character and have never been able to understand why anyone would. She starts out bitchy and ambitious and ends up the same way, only she's been through the Civil War and Reconstruction. Unlike most characters in serious fiction there's no real growth in Scarlett, no understanding, no self-knowledge. Everything's external with her. She learns about life mostly by watching other people fail.Her lover and then husband, Rhett Butler, is a dashing adventurer who understands Scarlett intuitively, and for all his erring ways really cares for her. Why is anyone's guess. They're soul-mates, in a manner of speaking, something he ""gets"" and rather enjoys, and which she never gets, and suffers for. The man she really wants is the one she can't have, the sensitive planter (plant?) aristocrat Ashley Wilkes, who represents the ""best"" of the South. But Ashley is taken with another. I find Scarlett's infatuation with Ashley the most interesting aspect of the film emotionally. It's so complete, so absolute, so crazy and so human, it's wholly believable, and is the one facet of Scarlett's personality that makes her at times touching. Were it not for her passion for Ashley Scarlett would be no more than a garden variety bitch, but on account of him she is an heroic bitch, a larger than life figure, almost awesome in her ferocious appetite for what is basically a fantasy.Gone With the Wind is definitely worth watching. Its Technicolor is remarkable even by today's standards, or maybe I should say especially by today's standards. Color is the one technical aspect of film that hasn't improved over the years. If anything, it's declined. Another glory of this movie is its production values, and for this a tip of the hat to Mr. William Cameron Menzies is in order. Menzies was many things, but is best remembered as a pioneer of motion picture art direction and set design, and Gone With the Wind is a superb example of this, and his crowning achievement. One has to pay close attention to fully appreciate the Menzies touch. Though he did not formally direct the film he essentially storyboarded it, which is half the battle, and one can see his work in the way characters are framed by, among other things, windows, doorways and fences. There's a completeness to this production, down to the smallest detail, that is astonishing. Menzies was also fond of forced perspective, which is the art of making things look longer or larger than they really are.The film is by no means perfect. It's too long, for one thing, and the second half drags. Much of the book and film's success had to do with its appeal to women. This is after all a woman's story, and it's largely told from a woman's perspective. But they might have thrown in something for the boys. There are no real battle scenes. Aside from the burning of Atlanta there's not a lot of action. While there's a good deal of movement in the film,--people do get around from place to place, usually on horseback or by carriage--it would have been nice to have seen them, once they arrive at their destination, do more than talk, argue, scheme and throw themselves down on sofas or across beds. At least the interiors are lush and pleasing to the eye. Another problem with the film is Max Steiner's overused, emphatic theme music. The more modest incidental music Steiner wrote, including some jolly little mood pieces, are quite nice and used far more judiciously. Still and all, there are some striking images in the film: the first glimpse of Tara, the entire barbecue sequence, the burning of Atlanta, the ball where Rhett ""buys"" Scarlett for a dance. Producer Selznick was very careful to stick as close to the novel as possible as much as he could, as he was afraid of alienating the book's millions of readers. Yet this fidelity gives the film an at times episodic quality, and one yearns for it to break free from its shackles and take on more of a life of its own. Even with these shortcomings, there's more than enough life in this movie to go around."
"1231","Gone with the Wind",1,"The Most Celebrated Terrible Film of All-Time","The film claims in the opening credits to have a historian as a consultant, Wilbur G. Kurtz. And, at the time of its making, what he did sufficed as history.The Old South was claimed to be a ""pretty world,"" ""a dream remembered,"" and full of gallantry. There are innumerable problems with the film the greatest of which is racist sentiment.The portrayal of ""Mammy"" is particularly racist. Manny has no name and her entire life is invested in Scarlett's. She says the happiest day of her life is when Scarlett has her child. She is always worried about the family's reputation and lives vicariously through them. She becomes terribly upset and emotional when Rhett and Scarlett fight. Most outrageously, Mammy is seen pushing USCT soldiers aside to allow Scarlett through as if Mammy and other former slaves have no interest in their own freedom.If the portrayal of Mammy is bad, the portrayal of Prissy is even worse. Mammy is at least portrayed has having some sense whereas Prissy plays ""the simple-minded darkie"" with no courage at all. Her high pitched voice serves to emphasize her inanity.Mammy and Prissy's characters are part of a larger lie that the movie attempts to tell: the myth of the ""loyal darkies."" In the scene where Atlanta is under attack by Sherman, some black men say, ""Don't worry! We'll stop them Yankees!"" When one slave is given a watch he refuses to accept it and insists that Scarlett should keep it as if to say, ""Look! These white people were so great to us we want nothing from them!"" The film also advances the myth of benign slavery. Scarlett's father tells her to treat slaves gently, as if the only problem is a few bad masters who commit excesses. When Ashley complains of misgivings about white prison labor, he says that he kept all of his slaves well-fed and would have freed them when his father died if the war had not done so first.Finally, the film advances the myth of the evil carpetbagger. ""Carpetbaggers"" are shown to be terrible and vicious people who kick injured Confederates off the road and ride with nicely dressed black men sitting in a position of equality. One night, the white southerners ""clean out the woods to protect their women,"" which is just code for organizing the KKK and committing murder.The film is rife with faux sentiment, posturing, and social strategizing. Scarlett O'Hara is simply a terrible character. She is screaming, crying and whining. She's weak, flirtatious, boy-crazy, and hopelessly in love. She slaps Prissy and tells her she will sell her south. Scarlett is manipulative, lying, deceptive, lovesick, and obsessed with looks. And all her tribulations are emphasized by melodramatic music and foreboding weather.Even scenes which would otherwise be wonderful must be condemned because of the vicious intent behind them. The contrast of the tree, Scarlett, and her father against the setting sun is simply perfect. But, it intends to advance the myth of the idyllic Old South. After the attack on Atlanta, the camera shows the land covered with soldiers and pans back up to the Confederate flag. While expertly shot, the scene is used to evoke sympathy for the Lost Cause.This film competes with Birth of a Nation for the title of ""Most Celebrated Terrible Film of All-Time."" Gone with the Wind is less racist, but much more celebrated than Birth of a Nation. Given the two criteria, it is difficult to say which is worse. Birth of a Nation has been kicked off AFI's Top 100 Films while Gone with the Wind still sits perched at #4. Whereas films like Christmas with the Kranks are unequivocally awful, Gone with the Wind is worse. The reason being that it is much worse to be shitty and pernicious than it is to be shitty and harmless.To paraphrase a quote from Scarlett, ""As God is my witness, I will never watch this film again!"""
"1232","Gone with the Wind",10,"Golden Age Hollywood at its zenith","What may be the most famous movie of all time is also one of the more purely entertaining epics ever made, although part of its astonishing longevity is because the film is much more than just another antebellum potboiler. Perhaps the secret to its success can be found in the central quartet of characters: petulant, headstrong Scarlett O'Hara; charming rogue Rhett Butler; and the less colorful but equally complex Ashley Wilkes and Melanie, completing a tangled romantic foursome thrown together and cast apart by chance, destiny, and the fortunes of war. But in the end the film belongs to Scarlett, and her rocky path to maturity, from her old plantation home through the siege of Atlanta to rags and later riches after the Civil War, makes the mammoth four-hour long production pass all too quickly. It's easy to see what made Margaret Mitchell's best-selling novel such a hot property at the time: Hollywood in the 1930s shared with the Old South similar ideals of wealth and privilege (and, in the studios, a similar plan of institutionalized slavery), and the film matches the grandeur of its subject by oozing pomp and prestige from every lavish Technicolor frame."
"1233","Gone with the Wind",8,"Overlong, overrated, but OK","I didn't really think Gone with the Wind was as great as everyone says it is. Granted, I am a teenager and I do tend to enjoy modern movies a bit more than older ones, but I love movies of all kinds. I did enjoy Gone with the Wind, but it was entirely too long, and it left me bored at times.The acting was OK. I don't think it was anything to get in a big fuss about, but it wasn't so bad. The scenery was pretty cool, especially the mansion. I found the characters to be, for the most part, annoying. Scarlett was a first-class sl*t if you as me. She would marry man after man just to serve her own purposes, often involving revenge or money. She struck me as a leech in this way, and her screeching voice tended to get on my nerves. Brett seemed like a jerk, but at least he was a first-class jerk. I found it very funny when he would try so hard to get Scarlet to admit that she loved him, and when she finally let her feelings out, he'd call her stupid. The black-stereotype servants also were a little annoying, though funny for the most part.I did like the movie, even though I speak bad of it. The storyline was good and it was interesting to watch Scarlett go change from the hopeful romantic that she started as to a very different woman. I just don't think this movie is as great as everyone says it is."
"1234","Gone with the Wind",10,"THE American Classic !","Gone with the wind-the most magnificent movie ever!As probably the greatest fan of this movie, and a Film Studies student with a clear conscious I can assert that Gone With the Wind is a cinematographic masterpiece. It is the legend amongst motion pictures based on Margaret Mitchell's novel produced from the impulsive outbreak of emotions. It's a romanticized depiction of the Civil War from the point of view of a southerner. It is a romance pictured on the war background. It is the story of a Southern belle who changes from a flirtatious, spoiled girl with not a care in the world less then what dress to wear to a hard-working and experienced widow determined to achieve everything she desires. The movie is diary of Scarlett O'Hara's troubles and skirmishes with her friends and lovers. Gone With the wind was Hollywood's most lavish and splendor movie in the 30s. With an excellent crew of stars, such as Vivian Leigh and Clark Gable, it won Oscars and many hearts. If Gone With the Wind was shot in the 21st century it would be the type of movie starring Brad Pitt and Angelina Jolie. The Oscar for Best Actress proves that Vivian Leigh did a great job at playing the gorgeous and spectacular character of Scarlett, and while Clark Gable was not singled out with any awards he faithfully represented the rude and gallant Rhett Butler. The movie shocked with it's rich and showy cinematography, 19th century costumes and breath taking details ranging from Scarlett's hairbrushes, through Rhett's shoes covered with Georgia's red dirt to the architecture and design of the plantations. It is no doubt that 67 years a go Victor Fleming directed an American stunning success, which watched every time evokes different emotions and comes back to redeem the good name of melodrama. Therefore, if you haven't seen it yet, what are you waiting for?"
"1235","Gone with the Wind",NA,"Underlying theme","Being an American who grew up in the south, I have a little extra knowledge of what the movie Gone With the Wind is about. When you talk to people in the southeastern states, sooner or later you're going to hear about the Civil War, because that subject is still under serious debate there, and there are a great number of people who are experts. Margaret Mitchell herself said that when she was a child she heard very many personal remembrances of that time, and in fact she was steeped in the living memory of the Civil War period.The book that she wrote is a recreation of that period, and the movie is a sort of living portrait drawn from the book. Even though the very strong characters of the story occupy the center of the stage, still the background is just as important, being the result of Margaret Mitchell's need to give expression to all she knew about the agony of the Civil War, still living so vividly in the minds of so many people in America."
"1236","Gone with the Wind",3,"Welcome to the most overrated film in history.","I have yet to figure out the allure of this film.  A whining girl falls in lust, watches a whole lot of other people much worse off than herself for a while, whines some more, goes home and vows to make her own life better rather than helping others.  There, I just saved three plus hours of your life.  Go help a homeless stranger, since you now have the time."
"1237","Gone with the Wind",6,"Not all that in my opinion ...","I'm sorry, I generally don't like this film. Expansive, epic, picturesque, an achievement for its time ... OK. A compelling story about the devastation, hardship, suffering and brutality of the Civil War, and the courage and resilience of its survivors ... OK, but credit the novel for all that.A key problem is the heroine, Scarlett O'Hara, who remains insufferably selfish and inhumane throughout this long movie. Are we supposed to admire her? I cannot. Another problem is that the film drags in many places. Too much screen time is focused on men professing love for Scarlett and Scarlett expressing her hopeless adoration for Ashley. Gosh, move on with it! Even for its time, I can't see how its flaws failed to overcome its grandeur."
"1238","Gone with the Wind",10,"My all time favorite movie","This movie is my absolutely favorite. It is the only film I have seen from the studio era that makes me forget it was filmed half a century ago. The acting is superb (although I hated Vivien Leigh's acting in the scene with Mammie while she is getting dressed for the TwelveOaks Ball) and the casting is perfect.Every film goer should see this film not only because of its quality, but also because of its place in history. GWTW was filmed during Hitler's reign in Germany, and it is reported that after watching this film Hitler dramatically increased funding to the German studios (which were at the time the only studios able to compete with Hollywood).If possible, try and find a copy of the new DVD version. It has a special ""Making Of"" segment that is absolutely fascinating."
"1239","Gone with the Wind",10,"This is really a master peace of moving making art","I use my library to check out DVDs, Gone with the wind was on my list for a year, and this DVD was always checked out to others. Until yesterday, I never got a chance to see it. Fortune arrived yesterday and I watched this movie. Its a 4 hour movie but trust me you don't get bored/tired in these 4 hours. The epic goes continuously and smoothly and takes you along. An amazing creation I would say. I regret that I could have watched this movie around a year back (when I got taste in Hollywood movie) by renting it out, but I waited for library DVD. There is a dialog in this movie 'Don't squnder time, this is the stuff life is made of !!' I loved it. I would say don't squander time, watch this long saga about a girl how she survived the long period of troubles and lack of love in her life. Acting, dialog, script, music, screenplay, costume, choreography, story, scenic beauty in the background etc. everything is so marvlously chosen/created/directed and the whole movie turns out to be a master peace in the movie making history. It is impressive to see that back in 1939 people could make movie like this, when there were no computers/sophisticated cameras and technology. Real stuff. Watch it."
"1240","Gone with the Wind",10,"A Magnificent Film that stands the test of time!","So much has been written about this film, that was made so many years ago, and that in itself should show just how great it was. Brilliantly cast and photographed, it still stands very high among the best films ever made. Sure there was a huge amount of publicity for it when first released, but it was well merited. Just look at the cast - Vivien Leigh was the ideal choice and if you care to think about today's actresses, who could play the role better? Clark Gable was ideal as Rhett Butler and by today's standards, maybe a bit over the top in some scenes, but still excellent. Melanie, a very difficult part was played to perfection by Olivia de Havilland, while Hattie McDaniel's Mammy was brilliant. You can go through the whole cast and rate them so high. The story was very well done, and the settings of the old South were brilliantly captured. See it for what it was, in its day, and glory in the result."
"1241","Gone with the Wind",10,"One of the best movies ever!!!","Gone With the Wind is a beautiful classic- a film that can never be made again. This extremely intricate story circles around Scarlett O'Hara; brilliantly portrayed by Vivien Leigh. This movie is undoubtedly one of the best movies ever and considering the year it was made, who can say to what extent this movie pulls you in the awesome story it unfolds. All the characters are so complexly created and so believably shaped. What this movie has is everything from brilliant actors and actresses, a magnificent original score, astounding cinematography, a deeply woven screenplay, vibrant costumes and sets and beautiful scenery combined with an amazing vision of the director. Oh what a movie! It can be watched over and over again and you will always find something deeper the next time you watch it. I must have counted a million times of crying. It is so touching. The characters have such brilliance among them and the actors are just so wonderful! A wonderful, perfect ensemble of actors. What more to say about this movie- I could go on. However, I will just say that this movie is one of the greatest movies of all time and is one of my favourite movies of all time!"

"1243","Gone with the Wind",9,"""Sir, you are no gentleman."" ""And you, Miss, are no lady.""","GONE WITH THE WIND is an epic melodrama which is very difficult to describe. Considering the thirties this movie is something most original in the history of cinema. Institution. The true magic of life. Of course, the term ""magic"" I think everything that lives in a certain time pass. I'm a little disappointed because I think it is in the final hour of an epic spectacle given the characteristics of the classic soap opera. This movie is full of freshness and strange irony. The irony of the film no one escaped, at least a ""gentleman"" in the American South. The horrors of war are quite credible. The arrogance and pomposity ""Southerners"" are completely the opposite of the characteristics of the main characters.Gone with the Wind is a love story at the time of the Civil War, in which each in its own way serves some human punishment. Although I am aware of racist moment that really exists in the film, I would not have acted rudely. Although the ""slaves"" happy and complex, their characterization is not at all realistic. This is best seen when they become part of the romance or love affairs of their ""masters"". The film is quite delicate and subtle. Some erotic themes are, to the extent permissible content, quite convincing.Set design, costume design, framing, story, theme and music are top notch. From the first sequence can be seen magic and suggest that this movie is very expensive.Gable (Rhett Butler) and Leigh (Scarlett O'Hara) are excellent. Scarlett is the central figure, and Rhett's character who meets her. Both characters are outlaws, unaccepted and stubborn. Perfect for each other, or just doomed?Howard (Ashley Wilkes) and de Havilland (Melanie Hamilton) are boring. However, when acting individually their good acting comes into play. They look great in a pair with the main two characters. It is interesting that even they do not fit into the concept of people from the South. Novel. So many tragic figure, none of which is happy. One persistent striving toward the one she can not have, and when it gets it is no longer interesting.I always watch this movie with relish, while I do not feel numb ass."
"1244","Gone with the Wind",10,"A classic!","GONE WITH THE WIND is a classic film. The plot is set against the backdrop of white Southerners and against the 19th-century American South, it tells the story of Scarlett O'Hara, the strong-willed daughter of a Georgia plantation owner, from her romantic pursuit of Ashley Wilkes, who is married to his cousin, Melanie Hamilton, to her marriage to Rhett Butler.Because the film is 4 hours and 18 minutes long, it is split into two parts. My mother has seen it and I have not seen this film at all, but this is the longest film ever made to win Best Picture, but was also the first movie in color.This film was nominated for 13 Academy Award nominations including: Best Picture, Best Actress, Best Supporting Actress, Best Director, Best Screenplay, Best Cinematography, Best Art Direction and Best Editing and it won eight in the process. This film is just iconic and memorable.Clark Gable, Vivien Leigh and the rest of the cast in this film are incredible and their performances are good and the screenwriters stay true to the book, but a lot of people complained about the very long run time, but I don't have a problem with the film.This film is remembered in today's popular culture and it's production has also been remembered today as well. It has been referenced, satirized, analyzed and dramatized and this film is just amazing and the poster of the film depicting Clark Gable and Vivien Leigh's characters embracing in a scene from the film is one of the greatest movie posters I ever seen in my life and I like the poster.Overall, GONE WITH THE WIND is simply a classic. There is no other way to describe this film and it is an absolute smash hit. 10/10."

"1247","Gone with the Wind",NA,"An epic movie in every meaning of the word","One of the most well-known films even today. Still the highest-grossing film ever released if you account for inflation. A grand epic about the times of American Civil War and how it affected a group of Southern landed gentry.Starring the indomitable Vivien Leigh as Scarlett O'Hara, the oldest daughter and presumed heir of the Tara plantation, and Clark Gable as Rhett Butler, her on and off mentor slash rival slash romantic interest. The story revolves around Scarlett in the months leading up to the Civil War and in the years that followed. And what a character. Very few movies I've seen in my life I have been able to call Films with a capital F. But this belongs on that elusive list.I find it especially intriguing how jaded they portray Scarlett. She is not a pleasant person, not at all. She's scheming, manipulative, almost purely after her own interest and she most certainly does not take a no for an answer. And yet the scene just before the interlude, where she swears that she and hers shall never suffer like they have suffered, is one of the strongest scenes I've ever see put on film. And the reason for that is the fact that you can understand where she is coming from. Likable she may not be. Admirable, on the other hand, oh so very much.And it's not like she's a pure villain or a monster either. She is not immune to the suffering of others, she is loyal to those she considers hers and her sheer willpower and force of personality are certainly something to be praised.She's also beautifully set up and contrasted by those around her. From Rhett Butler's more relaxed scheming to Melanie's (Olivia de Havilland) straight up sainthood.The only real problem I have with the film is the way it shows its age. More specifically the way it portrays slaves. It is told from the point of view of the South, and it tends to portray slaves as a simpler people, who are being gently looked after by their white masters. More often than not the slaves are shown either as people of limited understanding or as straight up mentally handicapped. It usually isn't the focus of the film, but the story is about the Civil War so it's always on the background. And it is uncomfortable, to tell the truth.Aside from that, the film is really good. A masterpiece. Masterfully acted, masterfully scripted, masterfully made. It is hard to recommend a film almost eighty years old and almost four hours in length to anyone. But in this case I believe the recommendation is more than warranted."
"1248","Gone with the Wind",10,"The Best Film of All Time?","Behold one of the greatest if not the greatest movie of all time! Gone with the Wind is the 1939 masterpiece that producer David Selznik and director Victor Fleming brought to life. Selznick was the genius who wanted to combine melodrama with advanced production techniques and that line of thinking gave birth to this film. Everything about this movie is perfect from the lush cinematography to the portrayal of women and people of color to the cultural power this movie has given to the world of cinema. For a movie that was released in December 1939, it by far exceeds the quality of film expected of that time and certainly almost beats every film made today. Without further ado, lets delve right into this masterpiece!
This movie is broken into two sections; pre-Civil War and post-Civil War. Scarlett (Vivien Leigh) is a strong-willed woman dealing with the pressures of war. With Atlanta burning and the Union Army advancing, she is put through a lot. However, she has feelings for Ashley (Leslie Howard). But Ashley is set to marry her cousin, Melanie (Olivia de Havilland). Mammy (Hattie McDaniel) warns Scarlett to put her feelings aside as the family celebrates the marriage. There is a new, mysterious man at the party, Rhett Butler (Clark Gable) who might be the one to change Scarlett's life. 
The movie has a lot of interesting themes. One theme is how women is portrayed. Scarlett acts more like a headstrong woman of the 1930's. The appeal of her character is how she individually goes after her own destiny; both economically (planting cotton and owning a lumber business) and sexually (going after the men she chooses). Audiences at the time were fascinated by her character standing up to the male characters, but she had to be punished in the end because they don't simply allow that sort of woman to stay unleashed for so long. That is where the famous phrase spoken by Rhett Butler, ""Frankly, my dear, I don't give a damn,"" comes from. 
 Another interesting theme is the portrayal of African Americans. There may be points of racism, but keep in mind that this film was made when there were still Jim Crow segregation laws in the South. The movie does sidestep that plantations came from the era of slavery. More sympathy is given to the calluses on Scarlett's hands as she works. Unlike any film of this time, at least African American characters were given a sense of humanity. Hattie McDaniel as Mammy comes away as the most sensible character in the movie. She has many good lines, and she completely deserved her Oscar win. Hattie happened to be the first African American ever to win an Academy Award. 
 It's no secret that the roles of Scarlett O'Hara and Rhett Butler were two of the most coveted roles of the century. Fortunately, both Clark Gable and Vivien Leigh were able to meet or even exceed the sky-high expectations already set for them. This film seemed perfect for the two actors with incredibly big egos. Gable with his party-boy attitude delivered maybe his best performance as an actor and Leigh, the beautiful actress known for her drug abuse really shined as the likable, mesmerizing Scarlett. 
 One of the amazing things about Gone with the Wind is the breathtaking visuals. Many films of the era had a bland look about them, but this is not one of those films. Ernest Haller's cinematography is the best I have ever seen. The film makes great use of showing off its gorgeous landscape. The burning of Atlanta scenes really brought the movie to life as well. The use of color and lighting is phenomenal. Also, the film produced one of the greatest scores of all time. Before the likes of John Williams or James Horner, we had Max Steiner. Listening to the score really brings out the goosebumps. This score is definitely one of my favorite scores. 
 Nominated for 10 Academy Awards, Gone with the Wind is a majestic, sweeping epic that details a romance within the backdrop of the Civil War. This movie will make tears fall down your face, will make you laugh, will make you shudder up with tension, and so on. Even though the movie is some four hours long, this movie is the definition of why we go to the movies. It tells a great story, and it tells it well. Along with the Wizard of Oz, 1939 turned out to be a banner year for film. My Grade: A+"
"1249","Gone with the Wind",NA,"Gone With Vivien Leigh.","When a group of women who called themselves The United Daughters Of The Confederacy heard that the role of Scarlett Ohara might be going to an Englishwoman they felt offended. Then when they heard that the role might go to Katherine Hepburn they changed their tune. ""Better an Englishwoman than a Yankee"", they said. Without a shadow of doubt, ""Gone With The Wind"" based on Margaret Mitchell's best seller remains one of the greatest movies ever made. Vivien Leigh was not only a great beauty she was also a great actress & gives a fantastic performance as Scarlet Ohara. Everyone who had read the book had said that the role of Rhett Butler just had to go to Clark Gable, even though Selznick International Pictures had to make heavy concessions to the MGM Studio for his services. Gable, himself, was somewhat reluctant to accept the role because he realised it was a ""woman's picture"" & he might not live up to expectations. He did, of course, & the rest is history. Despite endless rewrites of the script & a change of director from George Cukor to Victor Fleming it all worked out well in the end. When Victor Fleming took over he is reported as saying the script was ""no effing good"" & ordered another complete rewrite. Max Steiner wrote a really marvellous sweeping musical score for the movie, another of its strong points. Possibly the most memorably famous scene in all movie history takes place about halfway through the movie to Max Steiners music known as Tara's Theme. With the confederacy destroyed by war & Scarlet Ohara's home Tara also ruined she stares angrily up to the heavens & makes her ""As God Is My Witness"" speech. It is wonderful stuff & this a wonderful movie."
"1250","Gone with the Wind",10,"A Masterpiece","Having just viewed the 4 Disc set DVD release, I have to say it is without the best restoration of a movie I have ever seen. As time passes by, I cannot see any movie equaling its beauty and charm. Again one must consider cinema was still in its infancy in 1939. I remember the 50th anniversary release in 1989 having to queue for over 3 hours to see it. Was it worth it ? You bet it was. There has been too much negative reviews over the years regarding the wooden acting, soppy story line, but does ""Titanic"" fare any better ?. Would Di Caprio and Winslett have made a better Rhett and Scarlett ?. Hardly bares thinking of. Best movie ever? Yep!"
"1251","Gone with the Wind",10,"Scarlett. The spoiled girl of the movies.","For me to see ""Gone with the wind"" was very difficult. Because, years later, i pass TV channels and suddenly, i see the end. I say, ""well, i mean... maybe, the movie was not so good as they say""... Wrong!!! ""Gone with the wind"" is maybe, the best movie about a civil war. The cast is great. Clark Gable is the arrogant Rhett and Vivien Leigh as the famous Scarlett O'Hara, the spoiled girl of the movies. With the charming Olivia De Havilland, ""Gone with the wind"" is a good tale of war, love and tears. This classic film was maybe one of the most difficult projects to carry out. David O'Selznick, the produce of this masterpiece, thought that the Margaret Mithcell's book it could not be. With insistence David O'Selznick decides to accept. For the cast, was put Gable in the act. But, Scarlett!!!. A quantity of actresses go for the character. For example, Diana Barrymore, Joan Crawford, Bette Davis, Katharine Hepburn, Lucille Ball and Loretta Young. At the end, was Vivien, who was presented to Selznick by his brother, Myron Selznick. Vivien was daughter of a french man and a Irish woman as Scarlett, her character, was daughter of an Irish man and a french woman. Selznick with Gable, Leigh, a wonderful cast like Olivia De Havilland, Leslie Howard, Hatie Mc Daniel, Thomas Mitchell and various directors as Victor Fleming , George Cukor, Sam Wood, William Cameron Menzies and Sidney Franklin made one of the best historical films of all history of cinema. A true masterpiece.And now i think that ""Gone with the wind"" and her little character is inspiring. A life of battle, a life of war, a life of love. ""Gone with the wind"" is one of those masterpieces that are unforgettable.* Sorry for the mistakes... well, if there any"
"1252","Gone with the Wind",10,"Great movie!","""Gone with the Wind"" was written by Margaret Mitchell in 1936. This novel is loved be people in the world now.

Therefore, many American hard hit by the depressing. This movie represents American dream from the word ""The civilization gone with the Wind."" By this movie title and first scene. And, the way to string and enterprising live of Scarlet gives people in the world get over American a dream and hope. So, many people in the world love ""Gone with the Wind"". I recommend see this movie."
"1253","Gone with the Wind",10,"The most beautiful love-story ever written","Gone With the Wind is by far the best all-round movie ever made (and especially of its time). The cast is fantastic, with Vivien Leigh and Clark Gable portraying one of the most passionate and complex love story of all time. Head-strong, spoilt, beautiful Scarlett O'Hara is the belle of the county. With more beaux than anyone she is envied by all girls, admired by all men. But the only young man of her friends who is not her beau is the one she wants. Ashley Wilkes is to marry his cousin, Melanie Hamilton, and Scarlett is determined that this should not occur. Meanwhile, Rhett Butler, the rich, debonair Scallawag, is determined to have Scarlett, by any means possible. His suave mockery at firsts irritates Scarlett, but his charm slowly wins her over. The American civil war throws Scarlett's world into disarray, dramatically changing her life, and everything she ever knew is now challenged. Gone With the Wind tells Scarlett's story, of her three marriages, her struggles for money, food and security, her love for Ashley and her dislike for his wife, the kind-hearted, gentle Melanie. But most of all it tells the story of Scarlett and Rhett, a story of friendship, mockery, pain, sorrow, happiness and, ultimately, of love."
"1254","Gone with the Wind",10,"A glorious cinematic achievement setting the standard for epic movie making","I may be biased, as Gone With The Wind is my favorite movie ever!! I can't count how many times I have seen it, and I still cry every time. What originally touched me when I first saw the film was Scarlett's strength and fearlessness. Rarely has there been a heroine equal to Scarlett O'Hara, and certainly not prior to 1939. She is selfish, ruthless, determined, manipulative and vain, but also courageous, protective, naive, loyal and at times compassionate. Rhett Butler is also selfish, vain and determined, and yet sophisticated with a wit to match and a tongue like a whip, he is Scarlett's perfect verbal sparing partner. To watch their relationship evolve is what has made this film an enduring love story. Gone With The Wind is an incredible achievement showing us a broad spectrum of human emotions. Confronting war and adjusting to peace, love and hatred, adultery and loyalty are all explored in this vivid masterpiece of Hollywood's golden age The acting is wonderful, Vivian Leigh brought Scarlett to life just as Margaret Mitchell had written her. Vivian's amazing debut performance won her an Oscar. Not to mention that no one could have played a better Rhett Butler than Clark Gable and Hattie McDaniel was captivating as Mammy, winning best supporting actress for her role (the first for an African American actress).For those of you who watched the movie and fell in love with it as I did, I strongly encourage you to read the book. Although the film is relatively accurate to the novel, (if they had made the film true to the book, it would have been 8 hours long) the book is magnificent and a milestone in American literature. There are more fascinating characters to discover, great action and humor and a better insight into what's going on between Scarlett, Melanie, Rhett and Ashley. There is so much that happens in the novel that isn't even hinted at in the movie. For an example, in the novel Scarlett has 3 children.The film is timeless; deserving of it's 10 Oscars, and its place in film history. Don't let the length of the movie or the size of the book turn you off, once you get into the story, you'll be hooked."
"1255","Gone with the Wind",10,"A classic story of love","Gone With the Wind is a story of a love triangle, or more likely a quadrilateral. Scarlett O'Hara (Vivien Leigh) is a young woman who is in love with Ashley Wilkes (Leslie Howard). The only problem is, that Ashley marries another woman, Melanie Hamilton (Olivia de Havilland). Then there is Rhett Butler (Clark Gable) who is in love with Scarlett and eventually marries her, becoming her third husband. A love quadrilateral begins to develop throughout years.The story itself seems pretty easy and without good actors it would be a lame story. But it sure ain't. Clark Gable is a true 'mysterious man', sort of a macho who is always there when you need him and even if you don't. Vivien Leigh plays very well the development from nice and sweet Scarlett O'Hara to harsh and cold-hearted Scarlett O'Hara Hamilton Kennedy Butler. Olivia de Havilland is then again the soft and loving Melanie who cares for Scarlett and doesn't abandon her. Leslie Howard is a man struggling between Melanie, whom he loves and Scarlett, whom he (probably) desires.The story was simple but played brilliantly. I think that it deserves to be called the top of film history and even the best movie of all times. When watching it you get emotional and want to feel sorry for Scarlett, who is really nothing to be sorry of. I could recommend it for everyone to watch, especially film directors and producers of today. Maybe then we'll have something like it but it is sure that no one will ever make another ""Gone With the Wind""."
"1256","Gone with the Wind",10,"Timeless","Gone With The Wind is and probably always will be my favorite movie. And of course it's not hard to see why.For any romantic, the story is a true testimony to love. Scarlett O'Hara is probably one of the best characters in modern literature. She portrays the desires we all have, and her ruthless behavior shows how far she will go to get what she wants. From loveless marriage to loveless marriage, poverty, hunger, and jealousy, Scarlett struggles with the effects the Civil War has on her life. This is one of the first films done in color and for the time, some of the scenes are absolutely breath taking. One can make note of the scene where Scarlett is in Atlanta and stretched out as far as the eye can see are hundreds of wounded men. I really recommend this movie. It's a classic, it's romantic, it's heart breaking, and it's truthful. Gone With The Wind is a story that can speak to us on every single emotional level. The movie shows you a world where nothing is one sided, and what we have mistaken for truth may not be true at all."
"1257","Gone with the Wind",10,"read the book first!!","This movie is an epic romance set against the colourful backdrop of the Civil War. However, I do feel that in order to get a full idea of the story you must read the book (composed by Margaret Mitchell).The movie, for me personally, served as a companion for the book. I saw the movie a year ago and thought 'this is just long and boring'. However now that I've read 'Gone With The Wind', I love the movie and have seen it six times, which may not sound like much but considering it runs for 3h40 is quote impressive. Even if you haven't read it, 'Gone With The Wind' is worth a look, at least then you'll be able to form your own opinion of it instead of reading mine ;)"
"1258","Gone with the Wind",NA,"Beyond Magic","""Gone with the Wind"" is definitely one of those films that have time as their best judge. The highest-grossing film of all time, accounts its achievement through its outstanding quality. It is a film that was not made in a rush, one which benefited from the work of one of the best people in their field at the time: Selznick, Fleming, Cukor, Gable, Leigh, Havilland, Steiner<U+0085> - all proving that a masterpiece needs both time and talent to achieve completion.The first thing, which astonishes the viewer, is its sheer vastness. The large landscapes that seem to stretch to eternity are juxtaposed to some telling close-ups, allowing the audience to be absorbed in that era that was gone with the wind.In a period, in which Europe was preparing for war, Selznick was producing a lavish film, which tackled so many sensitive issues at the time, and yet without imposing any particular view. The best way to understand the impartiality is probably by quoting a Yankee woman, from the novel, who after receiving an answer from Scarlett about where to find a good nanny for her children, ends up saying: `I would never allow a black person to take care of my children'. Scarlett has nothing else but conclude that these Yankee's are just ignorant, remembering the soft bosom of Mammy. The main characters are nothing but great supporters of the humanity that lives in the heart of their slaves, as opposed to the liberators who would not bother a lot about the fate of a nation after it's sudden fall.Regardless, of its political difficulties, ""Gone with the Wind"" is a landmark in the history of film. The great performances are probably the main reason why people continue to adore the love story between the dashing Rhett Butler and the beautiful Scarlett O'Hara. Clark Gable has all the charisma and all the charms of Mitchell's character, raging from sheer passion to absolute destruction of the ego. As for Vivien Leigh, there is nothing to be reproached, apart from the fact that she is too beautiful for the characteristics given in the novel. She delivers a truly memorable performance, portraying so clearly the psychological struggle behind her choices. The supporting cast is applaudable: Olivia de Havilland, Leslie Howard, Hattie McDaniel, Thomas Mitchell, Barbara O'Neil give some of their most memorable appearances.And then there is the soundtrack. The main theme is a haunting piece, possibly Steiner's best achievement. The vibration of the sound connects naturally in the masterful cinematographic work of Ernest Haller.""Gone with the Wind"" is probably the definition of what Hollywood can do at its best. A truly magical piece that survives and lingers at our hearts like a newborn baby."
"1259","Gone with the Wind",NA,"Just an astounding masterpiece that should be cherished by all generations","I am 24 years of age and I can say that, for the first time in my life, last night, I saw GWTW. Thats right, I had never, ever seen the movie before, not even bits and pieces of it. Oh sure I saw Rhet sweep Scarlett off her feet and up the stairs, but that was about it. I had never seen one of the greatest American classics ever produced, not even a part of it.And would you believe I saw it alone? I have been asked by noit so few a girfriend to watch this movie, romantic and sweepingly epic as it is, but have always declined. Why? Well because I find, in my own point of view, that older romantic movies, just as older horror movies, are just not as effective on me today as they most undoubtedly were on people of that era. So I stayed away from this movie, believing that the hype and over-zelous love for this film would find me far too expectant of it and, thus, far more dissappointed then I should be. I was, however, very much wrong.I don't believe I will give, in any way, a general review of this film. Anyone reading this now knows of the story or has worshipped at its cinematic feet for years. Besides, a text book review, a dateline chronicle of this splendid film would not do it justice. As with great pieces of literature, the beauty lies not in the details but in the emotions garnered from the experience, and GWTW evokes such earth shattering emotions.You may scoff at my assertion that a movie could render upon me such strong emotions, but I feel that anytime an event takes place which alters the types of things that please you, that motivate you, that entertain or touch you in some way, well to me that is and shall always be earth shattering. I remember watching, as a child, JAWS and realizing that I could watch this story for years and years without ever tiring of it. It started a life long fascination with the sea and sharks which has never subsided. I remember being in 7th grade and reading for the first time a book that was a joy to read, a book that was an event at night rather then a burden. After reading, for my class, Lord of the Flies, I continued on, reading Lord of the Rings, and on and on and on after that to the point I find myself now where no night of mine is truly complete until I read a bit. I remember all of these things, and many more that have meant so much to me, and I can easily say that GWTW was one of those watershed moments for me.I want to visit Tara, I want become kismit friends with Rhet Butler, I want to find people in this world who loath Ashley as much as I do, who love and respect Melanie as much as I do, and who lust after, for some reason and not just physically, Scarlett as I find myself doing now. I want to see the old South as it was, with all of its splendor and horror, in slavery, put out upon the curb everyday for all to see. I want to see what the Civil War really looked like and I want to stand, jaw dropped and with a sense of dread, as men from both sides talk of short wars and little bloodshed.Mostly however I want to live the life that Gone with the Wind lays out. I want that life to be my life, if only for a moment, if only as a whisper in the ear of time. This movie made me believe in love, in that unquenchable love that passes all understanding, and made me afraid of it's trappings. I feel, even now, for Rhet Butler, so many years of wasting his love on someone incapable of returning it. I pity now Scarlett, left sobbing on the bottom steps of her gigantic home, loving the man she had just driven away with every pore of her being. I feel for them all as if I had known them myself, greavied with them in moments of lose, and celebrated in moments of triumph.This movie made me feel good, fullfilled, and satisfied completely at the end, so much so that I went to bed as writer, director, and actor, finishing a story I had just watch unfold. Sending Scarlett off to fight for Rhet, leaving Ashely behind to wallow in his own well deserved misery. I watched in my mind as Mammie grew older and more gentle as the years went on and Tara became smaller, yet more open and loving in its old age.I saw all this in my miond only because, as a great novel does, a great poem does, a great prose does, this movie left us all wanting more. Wanting it so much that we would stay awake at night, creating a larger, even grander world then the one we had been allowed to peer into. We needed to create more because 4 hours and 20 some odd years was not enough for us. It was but a taste, one so good we needed to raid the rest.And so will it go. New movies will evoke new emotions and new characters will make me laugh and cry and groan from disapproval, but GWTW will live on in my memory. With other films, they will pass in the halls of my thoughts only when I see them on TV or hear of them from friends, but GWTW will visit those halls from time to time without any pre-announced engagement. It will come in to brighten my day, to promise of something better, and to focus me on the beauties of life and all it has to offer. It is why we stare at the Mona Lisa, listen to Beethoven and Mozart, read Dickens and Shakespeare, and in the end, why we watch GWTW. For it gives us a sense of relief or purpose the likes of whcih nothing else does. For that, for last night, I am grateful for that story."
"1260","Gone with the Wind",8,"Nice","A movie classic forever. Besides, Gone With the Wind is my favorite book."
"1261","Gone with the Wind",10,"Frankly, I do give a damn","Rhett Butler: ""Frankly, my dear, I don't give a damn"". I love that line.The story is about a spoiled Southern girl's hopeless love for a married man. Producer David O. Selznick managed to expand this concept, and Margaret Mitchell's best-selling novel, into nearly four hours' worth of screen time, on a then-astronomical 3.7- million-dollar budget, creating what would become one of the most beloved movies of all time. Gone With the Wind opens in April of 1861, at the palatial Southern estate of Tara, where Scarlett O'Hara (Vivien Leigh) hears that her casual beau Ashley Wilkes (Leslie Howard) plans to marry ""mealy mouthed"" Melanie Hamilton (Olivia de Havilland). Despite warnings from her father (Thomas Mitchell) and her faithful servant Mammy (Hattie McDaniel), Scarlett intends to throw herself at Ashley at an upcoming barbecue at Twelve Oaks.Just like I said in my Chinatown review about checking out beloved classic like well Chinatown and some other movies as well. I have decided to take a break from the new movies that I couldn't give a crap about and I have no interest in them but as a reviewer myself that I force myself to do because that's how much I care about you all, your the reader reading this, before I got zone likes, but now I got you all and I'm very to be alive to review probably the best I've seen since...well since I'm been doing this.This is my first time ever that I've seen Vivien Leigh in and I know it's not the last, because she give such a Oscar worthy performance and- oh wait she already won a Oscar for this movie and for once the Oscars got it right. Vivien Leigh give such a excellent performance and she played the spoiled brat that at the first I hated and then later on her character completely changed and for incredible reason that are both hash but just how life works, and she nailed that perfectly.Now what the Oscars didn't get right is not letting Clark Gable take home gold for his outstanding performance in this movie. Hands down the best character in this whole movie was Rhett Butler, he had the best lines, every time he was on screen I was glued to it and he has a sick sense of humor that most people have, even me.The cinematography in this movie....wow just wow, that's what I call a beautiful sunset in every scene to end the day. There never was a scene in this movie that I thought it didn't look impressive, even with the scenes of civil war at least it looked good and I know that's not a nice thing to say but hey when a movie looks good it's best to be brought up.The director of the movie Victor Fleming who did The Wizard of Oz in the same year as this, and he directed the movie with skill and passion and it really dose show.Now for problems: ................I don't have any.Overall Gone With the Wind is a three hour perfection of art that isn't you bloated stick in the mood Hollywood film, not with this movie, at least I can look at this and actually call it an Oscar wining cult classic."
"1262","Gone with the Wind",10,"Amazing in nearly every way--with an insidiously racist undertone...","Gone with the Wind (1939)What to say after thousands of other reviews?First, see it. See it big. It has so many different kinds of scenes, such terrific color and photography, and is dripping with so much history come alive it is a thrill and a joy. It's just a really really well made movie.The acting is superb. You might not think about this since it's such an ""old"" film and it might automatically be old-fashioned. But it is not, not with the two leads above all. Clark Gable and Vivien Leigh are justifiably revered for what they did here. Leigh in particular works her butt off making scene after scene come alive, with horror and frivolousness and charm and passion. The story is great by itself (based on the book which was the best selling novel two years in a row). It's not about the Civil War and its aftermath, even though that's prominent (and vividly, memorably). It's about a woman who is so self-absorbed in her infatuation for another man she misses out on true love. Some of the side characters are amazing.So yes, a great movie--but one that bothered me all the way through for its handling of African Americans. I may have noticed this years ago but I don't remember being so disturbed by the constant stereotyping. The slaves are naturally uneducated, so I try to overlook that as simple truth. And the black actors who play the three or four main parts are astonishing, all of them. Hattie McDaniel won the Oscar that year for best supporting actress.The problem comes more from what all the white people say, or don't say, and what they don't do, over and over. There is no sense of shame, or apology, or perspective on their position as land owners and slave owners. Not before and not after the war. All of them, except Gable most of the time (he's a worldly and modern Southerner), mourn the loss of a great civilization, one built on slavery. They are so unabashed about this, and so many people say it, from Scarlett herself to the man she is infatuated with (the admirable Ashleigh) to all kinds of older and younger folks. Even the blacks are shown not in rebellion or joy at their release, but as slaves eager to fight for the South.The more I think about it the more it's disgusting. Now the answer to my complaint is probably that this is from the point of view of the South and so it's true to their perspective. And I think that might brush over some of the attitudes some of the time. But where are the slaves dying to be free? Where is a single voice of dissent among all the huge cast? Where are the Northerners with dignity and higher morality? (On this last point, when the Northerners appear after the burning of Atlanta, they too are shown only from a bitter Southern point of view--all of them, black and white, are opportunists and arrogant, selfish, ""un-civilized"" sorts.)I teach a beginning history of cinema class and so see a lot of movies from the whole century of the art. And it's painfully weird that the two lionized, epic, breakthrough films about the Civil War are both from the Southern point of view. I'm talking ""Birth of a Nation"" and ""Gone with the Wind."" And both are insidiously unfair to Blacks, one more subtly than the other but true.I'll end more cheerfully. Knowing the movie has this quality doesn't prevent you from enjoying it for a million other reasons. I laughed (it's very funny) and I cried (it's very moving). And I was endlessly impressed. Taken in perspective it's still a fabulous fabulous film."
"1263","Gone with the Wind",10,"The greatest film ever made!","This film is a masterpiece made by: 1.) The great performances by the beautiful Vivien Leigh and ever so handsome Clark Gable.2.) The outstanding production design and the emotions the settings invoke.3.) The sheer scale of the production and the magnificence of producer David O. Sekznick.4.) The music score by Max Steiner 5.) The wonderful characters and compelling story.6.) The fact that it has been loved for seventy years and that it will be loved for countless more years! GONE WITH THE WIND IS A MASTERPIECE IN EVERY SENSE OF THE WORD."
"1264","Double World",8,"Worth the watch","I'm not used to chinese movies. I saw this and thought should give it a try. At first the plot seems basic, unaware of the rpg background of the movie. Even though it has a few plot wholes or inconsistencies, it is full of surprises.
The CGI and the fighting scenes do make up for it.
Recommended"
"1265","Double World",7,"Easy entertainment","This movie doesn't waste much time with overly complex story, dialogue or character building. It's an action movie with a fair share of Martial Arts and Wuxia and it means business. Don't expect a Zhang Yimou level cinematography, but switch off your brain and expect to be decently entertained."
"1266","Double World",10,"Alot Better than I expected - This Movie Will Hold Viewers Of All Ages - Really Enjoyable","07/27/2020 I went into this movie expecting little and instead I got alot. Fast paced, well done fantasy storyline, excellent acting. Watch for yourself and decide. Bon Appetit'"
"1267","Double World",7,"A very entertaining 'historical' fantasy","A world of warriors, political intrigue, monsters and gigantic scorpions (no, this is not ""Clash of the Titans""), ""Double World"", based on a video game (some aspects of which can be reflected in the movie), is a very entertaining, even if simplistic, affair, a typical, heroes meet, heroes fight the bad ones, but with surprising depth for this kind of movies. The characters, the strong one, the cheerful one, the 'rising-from-the-bottom' one, etc., etc., are charicatures, but they are very well done charicatures and it is a treat to spend the lenght of the movie with them. And the plot... well, whatever you want to call it, is silly as they come, but it is not boring, a hypermusculated hero quest. It all becomes a little bit bloated, but never overstays its welcome. Worth trying."
"1268","Double World",6,"Not bad. Worth watching","I watched it with subtitles on for English. I feel foreign movies deserve to be views in the native language. It adds to the feel of the drama and excitement even if I can't understand it using my Bluetooth headphones while cooking.This Chinese produced movie is in the area of Crouching Tiger Hidden Dragon or Iron Monkey. It isn't in the same league as them, but it is pretty close. Martial arts with high flying effects, lots of CG mythical creatures and CG fire. Not top shelf, but really not to shabby.I liked the characters and I liked the story even though it was corny in some scenes. I didn't care much for the predictability of the story. I had the ending figured out by the 1/3rd mark. It was too simplistic. No surprises.As I mentioned the CG was OK. There were mythical creatures, fire and I'm assuming a lot of green screen stuff. They also used a lot of wires for the special martial arts and high flying stunts.Overall it really wasn't terrible and worth the entertainment value for two hours. I might watch it again to see if I can pick up on anything I missed the first time around."
"1269","Double World",7,"Unusual Chinese film","The sci fic and special effect did impress me. Chinese movie can be up to holloywood level really didn't expect. I get used to bored by this revenge and historical theme, but this one did it differently."

"1271","Double World",7,"What rubbish...no wait...it was ok","Such a topsy turvy film you are likely never to come across. If people say give it a chance bit a film was this terrible in the first 20 minutes then no one would blame you for turning off. The CGI is woeful and the acting ain't much better but....but....let the film keep going...let yourself get involved in it's less than stellar appearance and you will be rewarded by the end. The CGI gets better, the story gets better and the acting gets better. It's definitely never going to reach the levels of greatness but if you sit through it you will be pleasantly pleased."

But such minor drawback will never shunt you away from the sure volume of the movie.CGI is just exceptional and beautiful rendered. It looks very realistic except for minor areas of action scene. Well guess you can't go wrong with the effects as it took them literally 2 years to make it.

Actually, as fantasy adventure films go, it is pretty complete: handsome hero, mythical beasties; sword fights; martial arts before a predictable ending. Don't expect anything at all sophisticated here: the effects are straight out of a video game and the dialogue is minimalist but the action scenes redeem it somewhat, and for 2 hours of mindless fun you could do a heck of a lot worse."

"1301","Double World",9,"Very solid movie!! Im now a Chines movie fan!","Really really like this movie! Yea i know it is not perfect and there is a few bad cgi moments but over all the movie is awsome and they could for sure make a 2nd one if not even more"
"1302","Double World",9,"Out of expectation and worth to watch","At first I was not expecting much because story was based on a popular online game in China and I don't really like online games. But after watching, it was really out of my expectations. Actors and Special effect are really Excellent. I don't understand why there are 1 star reviews. Did they really watch the movie?"
"1303","The Gentlemen",9,"I don't understand the critics, this is brilliant.","The writing, directing, acting and the general production are all top notch. I have not had this much fun watching a movie in a long time. This will go down as a cult classic, so do not miss it."
"1304","The Gentlemen",9,"Ritchie returns to the crime genre and does so masterfully","Has there ever been a bad performance in a Guy Ritchie movie? If there has I haven't noticed it. He has an ornate ability to take average actors and make them great, and to take already great actors and get even more out of them. There are a few directors around who specialise in this but Ritchie is right near the top. The cast in 'The Gentlemen' is admittedly fantastic, but it doesn't change the fact that they are an absolute treat to watch. Matthew McConaughey is in his element in a role that he was born to play, Charlie Hunnam plays one of the coolest characters I've seen perfectly, Colin Farrell is hilarious and ridiculously cool as well and then Hugh Grant gives one of the best performances I've ever seen from him. In fact Grant was so good I didn't even recognise his voice and had to wonder if they'd dubbed it. They hadn't, he'd just nailed it.The style this movie possesses is just so much fun to watch. If you've seen any of Ritchie's previous similar films ('Lock, Stock and Two Smoking Barrels', 'Snatch', 'RocknRolla') then you know what I'm talking about. The pacing moves at lightning speed, the dialogue is quick, clever and deeper than you first realise and the conflict is always multi-layered. This one is actually told in quite a unique way with a couple of characters going over events that have already happened and it works masterfully. It breaks the story up and gives room for creativity in the story-telling process and also humour.Every time I see that Ritchie has made a movie that isn't a crime-thriller I get a little disappointed. It's not that the other stuff he's doing is bad ('Swept Away' being an obvious exception), it's just that he is so damn good as this style of movie. He's the best in the business and if he only did these for the rest of his career I'd be a very happy man. This is an excellent movie well worth your time and money."
"1305","The Gentlemen",8,"Hugh Grant is amazing","Fun film! I was greatly impressed with Hugh Grant's performance. Had to do a double take when he first appeared on the screen. Colin Farrell was a scene stealer and Michelle Dockery makes a great mob wife."
"1306","The Gentlemen",8,"Guy's Best Since Snatch.","It's Guy Ritchies Best since Snatch, it's where he is most playful and comfortable in a film genre he knows well.
The Cast is perfectly picked, especially Hugh Grant giving a different but yet so funny performance.
Sit back and enjoy 2 hours of a British crime drama, which doesn't take itself too serious
If we hadn't had lock stock or snatch then this would possibly looked at in a more classic Ritchie film so don't expect it to be as great as those."
"1307","The Gentlemen",10,"Guy Richie back to his best","After seeing the film at an advanced screening I was left pleasently surprised. It is one of the best crime films I have watched and the best from Guy Ritchie...even better than Snatch and Lock Stock, which is something.From the acting to the story, cinematography, pacing, dialogue, humour and overall enjoyment I cannot fault it...10/10. Special credit goes to Colin Farrell and his acting.We dont really get movies like this anymore. Movies these days are cheap money grabbers and superhero films. This is a whole different class of film"
"1308","The Gentlemen",10,"What an excellent film","Every now and again I go to the cinema and watch a film that grabs my attention straight away and keeps it right to the end. This is one of those films. What entertainment! Better than anything else I have seen for a considerable time."
"1309","The Gentlemen",9,"Perfect slow burn","At first I thought it started a little slowly but in hindsight it was just right. A perfect execution of a classic British gangster film epitomised by a charismatic Colin Farrell who stole every scene he entered and left me crying out for a coach spin off. All in all very enjoyable classic guy ritchie film."
"1310","The Gentlemen",8,"I like it","The story was attractive,good acts and good cast ,it could be mini series ."
"1311","The Gentlemen",7,"The Gentlemen","Guy Ritchie returned to his early style: multiple clues, multiple characters, excellent rhythm control, various black humor and satire, and addictive violence."
"1312","The Gentlemen",10,"Amazing","I was worried that the best parts of this movie were in the trailer but Oh My Goodness.... it doesn't even come close. What a treat! I love Guy Ritchie movies but this one was extra special.Hugh Grant was phenomenal and every scene was masterfully shot. Can't wait to see it again this weekend."
"1313","The Gentlemen",8,"Hugh, you beautiful phuker, I wanted to play the ukelele with your lips","You could practice with your hands for exactly the same amount of hours, but that still wouldn't make you Liberace. Some people, whether its cooking, tennis, or snooker, seem to put balls in pockets with ease. And so it is with some actors.In this film, High Grant and Colin Farrell shine, and they have some big hitters around them.If you've seen a Guy Ritchie film before, you know exactly what you are getting. Fast edits, narrative overlay in slow motion, punchy dialogue with multiple storylines, and this film does the usual. In some ways its directing style detracts from the film as a whole. Static camera, actors on their marks, quick shots, twenty cuts, fast speaking, and Ritchie letting you know you are watching a Ritchie film. But I still like it.And the reason was Hugh and Colin. They shine in every scene, no matter where they are in the shot, you cant help but look at them, If there is a sequel, make it about these two, the Sutch and Bumdance of London, and it will win everything."
"1314","The Gentlemen",9,"Razor sharp script","Richie's best film since snatch. Hugh Grant gives his best performance. He is simply brilliant , funny, little camp, but deadly. Go and watch ASAP."
"1315","The Gentlemen",10,"Stunning return for British crime capers","You can't take it from him, Guy delivers a gut wrenching yet fun and often laugh out loud British crime flick. The script was an absolute delight with some of the best dialogue I have heard in a very long time, delivered to perfection by all the main cast. It's a delight having a director and writer like Guy to keep the movie industry fresh, we need more original content like this being rewarded for originality.The cast, well Hugh Grant was fantastic, you quickly realise Grants been underused in films, he has range and this shines through. Colin Farrell too was an absolute standout when on screen, he stole the scenes and had me in stitches. The cast in general though were all brilliant, many many standout scenes.You have to watch this movie, supporting movies like this is important, original content is hard to come by and we need more of it. And trust me, you can't not enjoy this!"
"1316","The Gentlemen",8,"No Wedding & Loads of Funerals...","Guy Ritchie is back in his movie manor of gangsters and plot twists.Hugh Grant is a revelation.Go see it. Nuff Said."
"1317","The Gentlemen",8,"This film is GOOD and almost GREAT","When all the critic reports come out and the inevitable 'mediocre' scorings appear don't be worried: this is a very good film and Ritchie is back to his best.Snatch is a favourite of mine and I must say that this film surpasses it, in story, tone and cinematography. The twists are good, the jokes are great but what stands out are the performances. A 'star studded cast' seems to be the highlight of every movie nowadays but let me tell you, the majority of the performances in this film are oscar worthy and pure gold. I say majority of course because Jeremy Strong enlisted one of the worst acting performances I've seen this decade!It is by far a better tribute to cinema than that 'Once upon a time' nonsense and I urge you to see this film.The only drawback for me is the third act. Too many pipes are introduced late in the film which contributes to a somewhat lacklustre and crammed finale. But apart from that a solid film."
"1318","The Gentlemen",9,"As Guy Ritchie as Guy Ritchie gets","The Gentlemen is a wildly entertaining film with a fast paced, enjoyable story that keeps you guessing throughout. The way that Ritchie utilises narration in this film is very clever and is not the heavy handed exposition dump that you might see from lesser quality films.
The stellar cast is well credentialed and they all give excellent performances in this movie. A special mention goes out to Hugh Grant, who is far removed from his pigeonholed romantic comedy role to deliver a fantastic performance.
The Gentlemen is a great way to start 2020 and I highly recommend giving it a viewing"
"1319","The Gentlemen",NA,"It's not enough to act like the king, you have to BE the king.","This is a typical Guy Ritchie movie, there is a story, it isn't always easy to follow, but style is even more important. Matthew McConaughey is American Mickey Pearson who went to England as a young man on a Rhodes Scholarship. He soon learned that he had a knack for selling drugs to fellow students and that eventually blossomed into his vocation on a very broad scale. Now in middle age has decided to sell his marijuana empire, which included a dozen well-hidden farms, and retire to a leisurely life and maybe have a few rug rats with his beautiful and devoted wife. The price? Just 400 million British Pounds.As the news of that gets around a number of shady operators want to get their cuts from a number of devious means. So the movie is mainly about that and how Mickey and those loyal to him devise methods to protect him and his investments. The cast includes a number of well-known actors and the roles are uniformly interesting.This is a good movie for those who appreciate and enjoy this type of British underworld movie, there aren't really any characters who are good people, there are just different degrees of badness.I watched it at home on BluRay from my public library, my wife skipped, not her kind of movie."
"1320","The Gentlemen",9,"For THE film to watch and THE tracksuits to wear in 2020, look no further than The Gentlemen","In Love Actually, Hugh Grant, who coincidentally also lends his acting talents to The Gentlemen, tells a group of reporters: ""We may be a small country, but we're a great one too. (The) Country of Shakespeare, Churchill, The Beatles, Sean Connery, Harry Potter, David Beckham's right foot ... David Beckham's left foot come to think of it.""Well, in my opinion, he forgot to mention Guy Ritchie, who is known for his gangster films Lock, Stock and Two Smoking Barrels (1998) and Snatch (2000) among others, as well as the Sherlock Holmes' films of 2009 and 2011. With The Gentlemen, Guy Ritchie goes one step further in proving himself a national treasure of our friends the Brits.With the help of a cast comprised of big names and lovable favorites such as Matthew McConaughey, Charlie Hunnam, Hugh Grant and the inimitable Colin Farrell, as well as an intelligent, engaging and entertaining script, Guy Ritchie once again comes through in delivering sumptuous fare for the eyes and ears and heart. Here, Mickey Pearson (McConaughey), is a powerful American marijuana dealer based in England whose plan it is to retire and sell off his marijuana empire for a cool £400 Million to spend more time with his wife. As can be expected, more than a wrench is thrown into his plan. What ensues, is giddy entertainment a'la Chef Ritchie's Specialty of witty, super-fast, intelligent, humorous exchanges and more than a few sleights-of-hand by a gallery of engaging and colorful characters who are thrown into numerous subplots, countless twists and turns, betrayals, confrontations and several inevitable revelations.Sounds confusing 'duneh it'? It isn't.Sit back and enjoy the rich mischievousness with which this is all served and rest assured that Ritchie is a master. With a deft and artful hand and sure command of his narrative threads, he has fun rearranging the linearity of the story (which if attempted by anyone else might be confusing), and delivers something close to a masterpiece.8.7/10"
"1321","The Gentlemen",9,"The Gentlemen - Lore Of The Land","Guy Ritchie once again defines the dark gritty and hilarious antics of gangster LondonI believe fans like myself would be very happy if all of his future projects were of a similar calibre. Guy, I can believe that when you were starting out with Two Barrels that this is what you wanted to do. Keep doing it.Well done Guy, Hugh, Charlie...and everyone elseDoes anyone else think Colin Farrell is an underrated comic genius?"
"1322","The Gentlemen",10,"Brilliant","Literally can't pick a fault with the film, hilarious, great characters, great story line, definitely up there with being one of Guy Ritchie's best film to date, and a must watch in my opinion"
"1323","The Gentlemen",10,"Wow. Just wow.","Guy Ritchie returns to his story telling ways and it's brilliant. Charlie Hunnam and Hugh Grant are particularly amazing in this film and have you wanting more. Ritchie is back and I hope he doesn't leave."
"1324","The Gentlemen",3,"Not my cup of tea","I wanted to like this film. But I just couldn't. It wasn't comedic to me. And it didn't strike a cord of being a real-life engaging thriller to me either. It's very stylized. And although style can work in certain circumstances when the viewer is appropriately brought on-board. I felt like the plane left without me. A style really doesn't work if the characters become too artificial while trying to play-off an essence of reality at the same time.Much of the story about the main character (McConaughey's) is delivered as investigative conjecture from another character(Grant's). So as the narrator character reveals the main character's story, the narrator can later change the result of events we perceive by just revealing that the conjecture he presented before was inaccurate. This gets old really fast.Maybe this can work if the conjecture is absurd and funny or if the conjecture rings very true most of the time. That way it surprises the viewer when it's revealed to be wrong. But as I explained before, I didn't overall get a sense of either quality within the story-telling.Overall the film seemed very ambitious. But all of the pieces didn't seem to quite make sense to me together. And they might have been better off removing a few elements for this particular script.I wasn't too sympathetic for the characters I was supposed to be sympathetic for. I didn't understand the logic to some of the character decisions. Some of the moments of ""big reveals"" didn't seem too surprising to me. And a lot of the narration got annoying to me. More often than not it's better to show than tell the viewer what they need to know. I didn't think the voiceover was helpful in showing but telling. To put it simply, I felt it was more style than more substance. And the music didn't seem to help the storytelling to me either.I hope you like it if you see. But I also hope that if you have similar concerns and inclinations as me, that my review might spare you some time and/or money. I know I wish I had stayed away from this one."
"1325","The Gentlemen",7,"A fun, complex but wordy crime drama....","This is quite a cleverly interwoven crime story. Hugh Grant is surprisingly good in the role of a sort of camp narrator, as he tries his hand at blackmail by regaling an unflappable Charlie Hunnam with his interpretation of the goings-on around the attempted sale of an empire of ill-gotten gains by a really under-rated Matthew McConaughey, to an even more sexually ambiguous American billionaire. It's funny, mischievous and slick. Colin Farrell doesn't feature extensively, but when he does, he is cool and entertaining. There is a surfeit of Anglo-Saxon which I felt was a touch necessary - after a while it stops being a laugh and starts irritating. At times the script is witty and well paced, but for most of the film there is too little action and much too much verbiage. A good watch, though."
"1326","The Gentlemen",8,"Guy Ritchie in his bag","Went to a New Years day performance, best film of 2020 so far for me.
The film combined London gangsters, London Youth, wealthy aristocratic types and even asian gangsters seamlessly.
The pacing was outstanding, characters interesting and story competent.
Go and support this film!"
"1327","The Gentlemen",10,"A Great Way To Start 2020","The best Guy Ritchie and the most Guy Ritchie movie since Snatch. The ensemble cast is a delight and my only complain is that Henry Golding should have had more screen time. There all the perfect ingredients we expect in a comedy crime thriller filled with witty dialogues and twists.Matthew McConaughey finally gets his much need break since Interstellar and he is very convincing as an American expat in London. The screenplay obviously has been influenced by Tarantino's films like Reservoir Dogs and Pulp Fiction but nevertheless it works. This is the most fun I have ever had in a cinema since Game Night"
"1328","The Gentlemen",4,"Boring Movie. And the 3rd Person Narrative is Annoying","This film is very boring.
It is so annoying to have someone else in the movie tell the story about what happened.
It is so stupid. The movie jumps back and forth between the Protagonist a the person telling a story about the Protagonist.
What is the point of all that?
Why not just make a good movie that focus on the Protagonist only, and not worry about the person ""Telling a Story"" about the Protagonist.
Boring movie. Too much talking. Not enough action."
"1329","The Gentlemen",1,"what a waste of time","After you finish watching the movie. do an excercise and try to put togheter from your memories what happened in 2 hours. NOTHING"
"1330","The Gentlemen",9,"Critics have no clue","Please don't rely on what critics have scored, just read their reviews to understand that they have no clue."
"1331","The Gentlemen",4,"Crap","This movie tries to be everything, but it's nothing. It wants ti be dirty, but it's rather clean, it wants to be funny, but it's not and it is as sexy as my grandmother. No idea, where all the good ratings come from"
"1332","The Gentlemen",9,"Great! Classic Guy Ritchie gangster film!","The Gentleman is one heck of a ride. I absolutely loved every second of it. Guy Ritchie is a great director and is at the top of his game here and in his comfort zone with another great gangster film! Needless to say that Hunnam, McConaughey & Grant are all terrific here as usual."
"1333","The Gentlemen",3,"What if Guy Ritchie's weak Doppelganger directs a movie!!","My first ever review in IMDb & that too of my Favorite Director,So here goes...
Excellent story,great cast....and that's where it all ends.
I'm sure if you were a 90's kid,you would have fantasized about being a character in one of guy ritchie's movies,its that good!!
The way he shows us the back alley life style of London with all cut throats,drugs,hit men,bosses etc,gave a new perspective.
They were all classics.well except for swept away of course.
This movie has to be the weakest in the link.even though it had all the potential for being one of his best works.
weak plots,wanna be of the older movies,less intense,softened characters these all could have been avoided if the movie was taken with the same energy level as the earlier ones.
Thank go for the last 30 mins or else it would have been total disaster.That too said it is not that intense.if you watch the last 30 mins first,we would think as the movie has a good start and it can go very well from now on as in par with his older movies and with the potential it has.
well all this changes when cash truck comes out i hope and all the best for future endeavors.
'y'all stay safe and stay home."
"1334","The Gentlemen",3,"Trite","30 minutes is more than enough for me, it was simply TRITE and BORING. Noting to attract you during the first half of the movie, so why should you wait!?
Stop playing it and do something useful, you will regret your wasted time watching this !!!"
"1335","The Gentlemen",9,"Critics are idiots","This was a great movie.Flawless acting with a great story. Solid directing, solid everything...Colin Ferrell stole the show for me as he killed every scene he was in."
"1336","The Gentlemen",4,"I'm sorry Mr. Ritchie","I have no idea, why so many people rated this movie so highly. Maybe it is ok in terms of cinematography and acting, but the story and writing is just bad. First of all there is no protagonist. There no interesting characters in this. Is Matthew McConaughey a protagonist? - No! He is doing almoust nothing through the whole film. He had a cool disposition abot his rise to power though, i would love to watch that movie instead. There is no depth to this character, except a couple of cool speaches. Is Charlie Hunnam, who's basicaly a McConaughey's butler a protagonist? - No! He's main characterestic his unexplained loyalty. Basicaly the two characters are some sort of snobish gangsters look a likes, spending time in some pretensious bar. Martial guys disposition was cool, could also be a good movie. And the biggest flaw is that the whole premise is not believable. Good thing about previous Guy Ritchie movies was the chaos. Characters are being drawn into a mayhem of events. Stupidity and chance make movies funny and give them that sense of reality, because reality is also unpredictable. Gentlemen is all about plans, and characters magicaly forseeing each other actions, so the film fieels like a scenario, it fails in creating an illusion of reality. So it is just a generic gangster movie."
"1337","The Gentlemen",9,"Guy Ritchie is back!!","What a cracker, a joy to watch from start to finish!!"
"1338","The Gentlemen",5,"A Guy Ritchie film that tries, and fails, to reignite the magic from his first movies.","I've enjoyed a good portion of Guy Ritchie's filmmaking. While many of his more recent movies rely on franchise appeal (Sherlock Holmes (2009), The Man from U.N.C.L.E. (2015) and Aladdin (2019) are of note), I usually associate his style of filmmaking with the British heist film (like Lock, Stock and Two Smoking Barrels (1998) and Snatch (2000)). Consequently, I was looking forward to seeing his recent film, The Gentlemen (2020), as it seemed to be a return to the kind of filmmaking that attracted me to Guy Ritchie films in the first place.Unfortunately, it seems Ritchie has been away from his core movies for so long that he's almost forgotten how to make them. The meta framing with Hugh Grant and Charlie Hunnam was clunky enough that even Hunnam's character was getting bored with the ""telling"" in the exposition provided by Grant's character. Sure, there were a few neat twists here and there, but it was trying so hard to be a meta-movie like Seven Psychopaths (2012) or The Player (1992) that it lost its focus. In the end, it spent too much time trying to interweave the narrator's narrative and the story narrative, and all it ended up with was a jumbled mess of a movie.I didn't feel like the action or cinematography (two elements that defined Ritchie films in the past) was lacking. This was mostly because so much of this movie is told to us via Hugh Grant. Perhaps this was also because the meaningful action didn't even end up being real, but rather the imagined ""movie version"" of events that played so counter to the characters and how they would act as to break the suspension of disbelief. I'd forgive doing this once, but it seemed to happen on more than one occasion, resulting in an annoying ""just kidding"" wink from the narrator far too often. At the very least, The Gentlemen does show the difference between boys trying to be tough and men who are actually tough.A Guy Ritchie film that tries, and fails, to reignite the magic from his first movies, I give The Gentlemen 2.5 stars out of 5."
"1339","The Gentlemen",8,"Nothing too unexpected here, but it's funny and hugely entertaining","The Gentlemen is a return to the London gangster milieu where writer/director Guy Ritchie first made his name with films such as Lock, Stock and Two Smoking Barrels (1998) and Snatch (2000). His first foray into this territory since the disappointing RocknRolla (2008), The Gentlemen comes at the end of over a decade making big-budget studio-backed crimes against cinema. Granted, the film seems stuck in the last decade in more ways than one, it's highly questionable that the only gay character is a slimy S&M proponent who'll sleep with pretty much anyone, its token female character barely even manages to rise to the level of tokenism, and Ritchie does absolutely nothing new here - if you've seen Lock, Stock or snatch., you'll know pretty much exactly what to expect - but The Gentlemen is still hugely entertaining. Most of the jokes land, the dialogue is as sharp and expletive-laden as ever, the cast are having a ball, and the self-reflexivity, although a little forced in places, works well for the most part. And yes, the plot is as derivative as it gets, but there's no denying Ritchie has injected real verve into what looks on paper like an inconsequential C-movie. The Gentlemen definitely won't change your life, but it will make you laugh.The film begins as sleazy private eye Fletcher (Hugh Grant) arrives unannounced at the home of Ray (Charlie Hunnam), right-hand man to Mickey Pearson (Matthew McConaughey), a suave Oxford-educated American ex-pat who controls a huge marijuana empire in London, valued at around £400 million. Several months prior, Fletcher was hired by tabloid editor Big Dave (the great Eddie Marsan) to dig up dirt on Pearson with the aim to ruin him - Dave's revenge for Pearson blanking him at a gala. Fletcher has written a screenplay based on his investigation (titled Bush) and tells Ray that unless Pearson pays him £20 million, he will hand over everything he has to Dave. Meanwhile, Pearson has decided to sell his whole operation, but when word gets out, all hell breaks loose, as the various interested parties vie for advantage. Most of the subsequent film takes the form of Fletcher narrating his exploits to Ray, explaining how he learned so much about Pearson and what he does. Along the way, we meet characters such as Rosalind (Michelle Dockery), Pearson's ruthless and unflappable ""cockney Cleopatra"" wife, who runs a garage with an all-female staff; Berger (Jeremy Strong), Pearson's preferred buyer; Dry Eye (Henry Golding), the ambitious but brutal scion of a Chinese syndicate, who hopes to undermine Berger; Coach (a scene-stealing Colin Farrell), who runs a boxing gym for troubled youths and who inadvertently finds himself in the middle of everything; a plethora of property-rich-but-cash-poor landed gentry who are essential to Pearson's empire; a Russian oligarch; and a street gang called The Toddlers.Aesthetically, The Gentlemen is very much in the mould of Ritchie's previous gangster movies. Because Fletcher frames his narration as a screenplay, it allows Ritchie to employ a multitude of self-reflexive devices - a smash cut coinciding with Fletcher asking Ray to visualise a smash cut; voiceover transitioning into spoken dialogue; on-screen captions telling us who's who; animated maps; YouTube fight porn (don't ask); freeze-frames; rewinds; a shot of film running through a projector etc. At one point, Fletcher is discussing the merits of anamorphic (2.39:1) over 1.78:1, and the film's aspect ratio changes accordingly. At another, he's arguing for the merits of 35mm celluloid over digital, saying he likes the grain of celluloid photography, and the film duly switches formats. Such playfulness means that it never for a second takes itself too seriously, with probably the most self-reflexive moment coming towards the end, when we visit Miramax's offices in London (Miramax produced the movie), and we see a poster for Ritchie's The Man from U.N.C.L.E. (2015). All of this is immensely fun, with the more you know about the mechanics of assembling a film, the more humorously self-reflexive the film becomes - Fletcher even acknowledges his own role as an unreliable narrator.In terms of themes, the most obvious is something Ritchie has examined before - the idea that the economic divide between gangsters and aristocrats masks their practical similarities. Pearson straddles this divide; he's a gangster, but so too is he an aristocrat (in all but name), and the smooth running of his business depends on both classes - the aristocrats who he needs to grow his product (for reasons that constitute a bit of a spoiler, so I'm not going to get into it) and the gangsters who distribute that product. The clash between the pompous insularity of the English upper class and the perceived uncouthness of the lower class has been done to death in both literature (Wuthering Heights (1847) springs to mind) and film (Performance (1970), for example), and although Ritchie doesn't say anything even remotely new about it, it still forms an interesting textural background - gentrification is ever-present; there are ironic references to the posh areas of Croydon; Ray, a working-class Newcastle native, is a cleanliness freak who eats wagyu steak and lives in a mansion, and when he's dispatched on a mission to an uncivilised working-class area, he explains he ""just hates them junkies,"" seeing them as very much his social inferiors.One of the most central scenes sees a group of obnoxious privileged teens holed up in a council flat, whilst on the street below, a gang of machete-wielding delinquents terrorise the neighbourhood. As Ray and his men clash with the gang, there's a real sense of old vs. new - traditional gangsters fighting it out with internet-savvy hoodlums who don't give a damn about tradition or respect. There are a lot of laughs to be had with these issues, such as Ray and Coach having problems pronouncing the name Phuc. And again, none of this is presented as even remotely serious.The biggest problems with the film are probably its lack of depth, and the familiarity of the presentation, characters, and milieu - there's nothing here you haven't seen in previous Ritchie films. And as you would expect, there isn't much in the way of emotional maturity or narrative complexity. It's all very surface-level, and it makes no apologies for such.Nevertheless, I thoroughly enjoyed The Gentlemen. It's a funny as hell caper and the actors are clearly having terrific fun. It might be formulaic and overly familiar, but it's also immensely enjoyable."
"1340","The Gentlemen",5,"Guy Ritichie is now his own cliche","If you've seen any of these criminal Guy Ritchie movies, you've already seen this. It's no Lock, Stock, and Smoking Barrel. It's not even Snatch. It's like Scorsese making Good Fellas for the 5th time in a row with slightly different characters, but MUCH worse dialog. It's worth 5 stars only because it's not horrible, the acting is alright, the technical aspects are fine... It's just boring, and it's been done to death by this director and Steven Soderbergh's Oceans movies. What a waste of everyone's time and efforts. Oh well. At least it's 30 minutes longer than it needs to be."
"1341","The Gentlemen",8,"Familiar Territory, but Guy Ritchie in Best Form","In all Guy Ritchie's crime caper movies there is, perhaps, an amorality and glorification of violence which ordinarily I would find unedifying. But only once, in the morally bankrupt RocknRolla, did this ruin the film and have me booing, metaphorically, at the end; his undoubted talent as a filmmaker has glossed over these shortcomings on all other occasions.The Gentlemen is the latest in the series, written and directed by Mr Ritchie. Matthew McConaughey plays drug lord Mickey Pearson who is looking to sell his British interests, attracting the attention of other underworld figures keen to inherit his thriving empire.Guy Ritchie's sharp direction and non-lateral storytelling are on top form. The script is crisp and witty, the continual plot twists keep you on your toes. If you feel some of the Mockney dialogue is a little bombastic, well, it'd be like going to watch a Carry On film and then complaining about double entendres - over the top dialogue is what he does; it's his trademark. And his homage to The Long Good Friday is a nice touch and contains a further surprise.Most of the cast are also on top form, clearly enjoying themselves. Special mention to Hugh Grant playing a seedily odious private investigator-cum-blackmailer. His portrayal is something of a meta joke, channelling his hatred of the British tabloid hacks who have famously pursued the illegal tactics which his character practices. Perhaps the only failure is Henry Golding, in his first role outside rom-com, not quite convincing as a would-be Pablo Escobar. And it's a shame the excellent Colin Farrell's role isn't beefed up more. But these are mere quibbles.The Gentlemen is a fast paced and laugh out loud action movie, an enjoyable holiday treat for adults."
"1342","The Gentlemen",6,"Bit clunky!","This is a typical Guy Ritchie film. Plenty of action, deaths, bad language and occasional laughs. Some of the scenes are Pulp Fiction-esque. There's not a lot new here, but the film moves along quite nicely. Not overly keen on the storytelling format of the film, and Hugh Grant goes on a bit too much. Matthew Mcconaughey is well cast, Colin Farrell steals the show and will probably win some awards for his performance. Some poor script writing at times, but overall well worth a watch."
"1343","The Gentlemen",6,"It would be a great flim if it was released 22 years ago.","It's like the 2020 ok version of Lock, Stock and Two Smoking Barrels."
"1344","The Gentlemen",1,"Like an audio book, too narrative !","Full of stars and names I recognize but, such a let down. It is SO narrative. It's like listening to an audio book. A movie is supposed to be filled with ACTION and ACTING, and a MUSICAL SCORE that moves you. This film has nothing of that. It is like an excuse to get a bunch of Hollywood stars WORKING in SOMETHING to get them paid during the downturn. The story JUMPS, here and here, and here and here and geeze~ ! It is SO obvious that more money was spent on the elaborate costumes of the time, than was spent on the script itself. It's a high school quality play put to film by 'I don't know who' .
A sore waste of time. I forced myself to watch it for about 30 minutes, then puttered around the house, half listening to it, and finally turned it off. I do not recommend this movie to anyone except maybe /possibly 'people of a certain lifestyle' who might really enjoy critiquing the costumes."
"1345","The Gentlemen",4,"god bless colin farrell","Colin Farrell is the ONLY and I mean only thing I enjoyed about this movie.The rest of it was too long and too boring and trying wayyyy too hard. And what was up with that ending? Saw it in theaters and hated it"
"1346","The Gentlemen",8,"Inventive and Clever","Ever since he burst onto the film scene with back-to-back interesting British Mob movies LOCK, STOCK & TWO SMOKING BARRELS and SNATCH, Director Guy Ritchie has had a ""hit and miss"" track record (including the Madonna-starring, Razzie-Award ""winner"" SWEPT AWAY). Fortunately, for us, we seem to be in a Guy Ritchie ""peak"" a this moment.Following up to his surprise strong Directing turn in the live action ALADDIN remake (if you haven't seen this film, the BankofMarquis strongly recommends you do), Ritchie returns to his ""British Gangster"" roots with the violent, funny and original THE GENTLEMEN.Starring Matthew McConaughey as a U.S. born and bred, Cambridge educated hustler who becomes king of the British Marijuana scene who is looking to get out of the business, THE GENTLEMEN tells the tale of the...ahem...gentlemen that are pursuing (both legitimately and illegitimately) his empire.The way that this film is constructed, the most essential casting of this film is that of the central character of Michael Pearson. He is billed as an enigmatic, charismatic, violent and brilliant legend of the British drug trade, so Ritchie needed someone with all these qualities to inhabit that role. Fortunately, with McConaughey, Ritchie finds his man (I'm sure the backstory of this character needed to be tweaked a bit upon this casting to explain why an American is the king of British Weed). McConaughey is at his laconic best in this role, bringing star quality - and star power - that holds the center of this film together well.He is joined by a strong cast that understands the type of film they are in and are game to join in on the (violent) fun. Michelle Dockery (DOWNTON ABBEY), Henry Golding (CRAZY, RICH ASIANS) , Jeremy Strong (THE BIG SHORT) and the always watchable Eddie Marsan (THE WORLD'S END, amongst others) all are strong in the limited moments that their characters are allowed to shine, but with McConaughey and 3 other actors I will speak to in a moment, they are relegated mostly to the background.This is because Hugh Grant (4 WEDDINGS AND A FUNERAL), Colin Farrell (PHONE BOOTH) and (surpisingly) Charlie Hunnam IPACIFIC RIM) almost steal the film from McConaughey, Each one of these characters could have easily been the centerpiece of their own film and I would be happy if Ritchie would spin one of these characters off.Credit, of course, for all of this has to go to Ritchie who wrote and directed this film I was pleasantly surprised by the cleverness and inventiveness in storytelling and style as well as the restraint that Ritchie shows in the violence. He uses it (somewhat) sparingly and well, so the violence punctuates the action.All-in-all a fun (though violent) time at the movies.Letter Grade: A-8 stars (out of 10) and you can take that to the Bank(ofMarquis)"
"1347","The Gentlemen",2,"Guess I just didn't get it...","To be fair I will say I took a friend to the movie and about 30 minutes and I could already see him tossing and turning. About 40 minutes and he turned to me and said how boring and slow the movie was. So this definitely affected my viewing pleasure. However I was also very bored, I couldn't believe how slow paced everything was. Basically nothing had happened 45 minutes in, and I for only the second time in my life walked out of the movie theater (The first being raising Helen with Kate Hudson)
I may end up giving the movie another try just based off of so many good reviews/friends asking if I stayed around for part XY and Z?"
"1348","The Gentlemen",1,"Trying to be too clever","Turned it off after half hour !!
Over the top pile of rubbish, makes Tarantino look like Scorsese <U+0001F937><U+200D><U+2642><U+FE0F>"
"1349","The Gentlemen",2,"Boring and Pointless","What is this movie trying to say? That crime behave badly. Oh, I got that much. The storyline is thin, the scenes disjointed but above all, it was just boring. Gave up at the 58 minute mark because I didn't want to waste another hour. The acting was good so I give it two stars."
"1350","The Gentlemen",2,"Turned it off","I had just finished watching Just Mercy and started to watch The Gentlemen. I made it about 30 minutes into the movie before I turned it off. I rarely turn off movies but this one had to go. The only thing entertaining was Hugh Grant's accent."
"1351","The Gentlemen",1,"second worst after Revolver","Another worse movie for Ritchie after Revolver and the travesty he directed and called it Aladdin...too talent less and incompetent to direct anything anymore...why are people like with no skill and no taste like this directing movies????"
"1352","The Gentlemen",5,"A disappointment.","I expected a lot more from a movie headlining these two but this was just some kind of bad heist movie ripoff using pot as a lure.My personal opinion though, if you liked Hugh Grant's performance, well that's your personal problem now ain't it."
"1353","The Gentlemen",5,"Slow beginning","It was very slow to start. It got better towards the end but wished it was good all the way through. Great cast."
"1354","The Gentlemen",1,"Vapid and stupid","This movie is a great example of what happens, when mediocre director like Guy Ritchie gets budget. Awful! And of course, it's not even successfull. Another vapid, stupid scenario about some vapid posers. This so called director is a one trick pony, and every film Ritchie makes only demonstrates his low talent.
Waste of my time and money."
"1355","The Gentlemen",1,"Awful, couldn't watch....","How's this garbage rated 8 out of 10???? I'd rather watch ads than this trash."
"1356","The Gentlemen",8,"Ritchie delivers","Guy Ritchie has always been hit or miss with me especially in recent years but it is safe to say that this film is arguably his best and definitely up there with Lock Stock and Snatch.It does take maybe 20 minutes to get going and get great but once it does, it's fantastic. It's hilarious and a great intelligent crime film.Everyone is terrific here. All delivering great performances. For me the stand out was Hugh Grant and Colin Farrell who provide some of the best moments of the film.It's a very creative and stylish film and I wouldn't say there are many flaws in the film. It's a story which gets a fresh and unique take on it and Guy Ritchie really out did himself here.Also ""old McDonald had a farm"" is used hilariously here."
"1357","The Gentlemen",5,"A facsimile","It goes through all of the expected motions but it is just a facsimile, a pale copy, of the original it wants to be.Soft actors playing hard parts.A good movie to watch if you gave something more interesting to be doing at the same time."
"1358","The Gentlemen",3,"Poor","Apart from the coach in Colin Farrells character the rest of the cast were mediocre at best. As many liked hugh grants performance I thought he had the flu. The dialogue was farcical and made for some humour but it's way out there, not on the level of kingsman or even close. I expexted more from the director of Snatch etcc."
"1359","The Gentlemen",1,"Probably one of the most boring movies to watch.","The acting is slow, the action is dumb, the script is off point, the story-line is stupid, the editing is very dull and boring. In short; boring, boring and then boring."
"1360","The Gentlemen",1,"Dull, lackluster, borefest!","This movie is just dull. Apparently to enjoy it, you need to be a Guy Ritchie fan. No expectations going into this movie and never saw a Guy Ritchie movie. Very few laughs, too much dialogue and the story line is lackluster. Couldn't sit through the whole thing, a borefest to put it mildly. If this is considered entertainment, Shoot me in the head and put me out of my misery."
"1361","The Gentlemen",NA,"Real Sophisticated Tings","This is early Ritchie; unapologetically crypted, woven, streamlined and bolshy. Kant is repetitive & real and feels like an up yours to the 'biz' - any business to that matter but particularly this one.The breakdown of weed etymologically rise to skunkhood is important. For this, social issues catergory, goes where few reporters have ever gone; that gentry lands of the country grubby hands moulding the youth crime in London. This is the surprise under the sleeves of the top notch suits / clothing - the external layers that identify the whose who in these well-heeled crews.And, as matter of personal taste. The music element / Grime as a popular culture commodity opens Ritchie's voice to a whole new audience. Outsnading performances by perfectly cast Media loathing Hugh Grant ( perfect), Mr Hearthrob Mathew McConaughey, Henry Golding, Jeremy Strong and the the incredible Cockney Cleopatra Michelle Dockery - who is perfect, raw and her nature on screen has been missed, which just proves that more women characters only increase the value to any 'gangster' genre film - Goodfellas wouldn't be Goodfellas without the women.Don't miss out watch it on the big screen, it's worth every penny."
"1362","The Gentlemen",6,"Guy Ritchie is directing the same movie over and over again","Enjoyable but nothing new.
Same movie like his old ones."
"1363","The Gentlemen",6,"Good British gangster story.","'The Gentlemen' is a return to Guy Ritchie's return to form. While no 'Snatch' or 'Lock, Stock & Two Smoking Barrels', it's a mostly fun British gangster romp, with a token American, this time Mickey (McConaughey) as the pot-dealing kingpin. It's ironic in that they are mostly gentlemen in how they dress and how they speak, except or the number of c-bombs dropped! Great cast, but lots of players, so no one gets much of a chance to shine.Mickey's tale of selling his drug empire to Mathew (Strong) is told via a long discussion between Fletcher (Grant), a journalist, and Raymond (Hunnam), Mickey's right-hand-man. Grant is pretty funny trying to do a possibly Welsh accent. The device of using the discussion to show the narrative, means the film can go back and correct the story when it needs to. There's a few twists and turns and while it's fun watching Grant and Hunnam, the film really picks up in the final act when we're in ""real time"". Good to see Farrell have fun, as well as Golding and Dockery.The main problem with the narrative device is that Mickey doesn't seem real and McConaughey's character isn't really fleshed out. Solid ending, but not really enough action or drama to engage throughout. Some funny moments, but not really laugh-out-loud for the most part."
"1364","The Gentlemen",5,"Sorry not very good. SLOW","I think people pay movie theater prices and review the movie higher than what it is because they paid.Slow movie, many times i felt like i was watching a commercial.The best part was watching Huge Grant act again and hes still very good. Only thing in the movie that made me not give it a 1/10 review.Don't waste your time nothing close to SNATCH at all!"
"1365","The Gentlemen",2,"Terrible","This movie was terrible. It glamorized the life/business of a pot manufacturer/dealer. I had high expectations with this cast and was completely disappointed. I love Matthew McConaughey but even with him in it, this was bad."
"1366","The Gentlemen",10,"Sequel please?!?","I absolutely loved this film. Very unique in it's own way. I would love to see a sequel to this masterpiece."
"1367","The Gentlemen",4,"My fitbit thought I fell asleep. Unfortunately, I didn't.","I don't understand how this film has such high reviews. The narrative structure killed any possible suspense. The story was not great to say the least. It had potential but it seemed to be trying to pull off too many tropes at once and it all fell flat. It was decently original but that does not mean it was worth the watch.I am not a highly critical spectator and can almost always find merit to the most mediocre films but man, this film.... yikes."
"1368","The Gentlemen",6,"A parody of Guy Richie at his best","Whilst there are plenty of enjoyable moments in this film, one can not help getting distracted by the endless quips and witty one liners. It boils down to the law of diminishing returns - too much of anything and it will eventually lose its impact. This could be said about much of the dialogue and plot trajectory. The Gentleman is fun, it's flashy, it's amusing - it's Guy Richie. But it also feels like a rehashed pastiche of a bygone era. An era when he made crime movies that were genuinely funny and gripping. It is with a heavy heart that the same can not be said of this one. It felt hollow and contrived in comparison to his more iconic earlier works.He does however notably take on the woke brigade; for this, Guy, I doff my cap to you sir."
"1369","The Gentlemen",1,"waste of time","I like Matthew McConaughey, and I was intrigued by the trailer, so I went to see it. I thought it was one of the stupidest films I ever saw."
"1370","The Gentlemen",9,"Funny, great storytelling by guy Ritchie","Really really enjoyed this . If you love guy Ritchie films and all types of gangster flicks this is one you have to watch"
"1371","The Gentlemen",4,"DISGUSTING","I cant understand those that gave these movie 10, really why?! Boring, without interesting story, predictable"
"1372","The Gentlemen",1,"Dont get uscked into the hype","I had seen reviews and the trailer looked OK and even a friend said it was good..... It wasn't it was all over the place and just seemed like the director was having some fun at the expense of a story, a movie or anything really... Its one of a few movies I actually turned offGo and do something else and don't waste your time on this junk"
"1373","The Gentlemen",2,"Dire","I was told this was a 'return to form' for Ritchie, I found it woeful from beginning to end. 2 stars for the acting of Grant and Farell."
"1374","The Gentlemen",3,"Latest Ritchieflick is half-amusing SHOCK. (We're being generous)","Watching Matthew McConaughey attempting to keep up with the talent in this latest Ritchieflick (the director who has to have his own sub-genre) is entertaining in itself. McConaughey mistakenly brings his usual earnest acting style to a world that's as real a depiction of the Brit underworld as The Magic Roundabout is of a midsummer's fete in The Wicker Man.As usual, Guy has bought in top artistes such as Hugh Grant, Michelle Dockery, Colin Farrell, Jeremy Strong and similar to convey the deeply wrought characters in his latest Carry-On-Gangsta fairy tale.Thing is, there's no such thing as a good or bad Ritchieflick - you can't really compare him to other filmmakers because, as previously noted, he's all his own thing. You can tell he wants to be a Tarantino or Scorsese, but unlike those auteurs, he swims in a rather more shallow pool of human behaviour, that inhabited by a kind of watery species of cliche. There are so, so many, but here's an example: Ritchie graciously takes the time to have Farrell's character mansplain certain racist terms for the viewer, so if you happen to be black and someone calls you a black c***, there's no need to feel offended. Glad that's sorted then. Has anyone told the rest of the world?Honestly? It's a fun hatewatch, silly without ever being wretched or (god forbid) too serious, but there are so many other filmmakers out there who really do deserve your attention and hard-earned. Taken on its own terms, it's the usual hilariously puerile piece of dog s#!*% - well put together and turned out, like a spotty teen wearing his dad's expensive suit and attempting to fill it out by puffing up his chest. Except this teen will likely never grow up - he'll just carry on making this kind of stunted fare. He thinks it's stylish, and maybe it is, if someone else is doing it. There does indeed come a point Guy, when the young do succeed the old, but you really have to want to grow up first."
"1375","The Gentlemen",3,"Confused movie","After 15 or 20 minutes you don't know who the personages are.
Continuing to see the movie is not much what you can clarify
Boring
It is a pity .So many excelent actors wasted in that way."
"1376","The Gentlemen",1,"Don't watch","This has to be one of the worst films ever its just crap"
"1377","The Gentlemen",1,"Worst Movie Ever","It was a waste of time and one of the worst movies I have ever seen"
"1378","The Gentlemen",10,"Great movie for those that don't look for reasons to be outraged","Probably one of the best movies I've seen in years. Highly entertaining story and yes this is a violent film. If you want to look for racism and every other dumb woke complaint you won't enjoy this. Colin Ferrel's character was awesome along with his toddler gang. Everyone was great. It was very entertaining and paced well. This probably won't be your movie if you like Marvel comic books stories with identity / sexuality PC stupidity at the forefront."
"1379","The Gentlemen",1,"One of the worst films in history","I am not kidding when I say it is one of the worst films ever made. It was incredibly sloppily put together. Hugh Grant had such a bad performance it was laughable. It was mind numbingly boring with a story that was so generic I thought a 13 year old child had written the screenplay. I cringed all the way through this poor attempt."
"1380","The Gentlemen",1,"Atrocious","Atrocious from start to finish; no subplot makes any sense; no antagonist, only a series of 'protagonist beat'em all up' and that's pretty much it; does it work as a satire? - no way. The Chinese are an organization of four or five; the Russians are three, four as well. It's like a movie written by a 17yo fan-fiction wannabe.if someone else would have come with such a script, wouldn't have ever seen the lights of cinema, right? People are complaining it's 'too wordy', that's not a problem; if you like Tarkovsky, or Bergman, or so many other cinema giants, you know there's no such thing as 'too wordy'; but when the script is this poor that would not make it to straight2dvd - that's another issue entirely.Mr. Ritchie has some great stuff in the past; who knows, maybe his next project will be a bit closer to his own potential.Looks like this generation loves to live stuff just for the sake of loving them; nothing wrong with that.Anyway.Written by Mickey Mouse; for the Mickey Mouse generation."
"1381","The Gentlemen",3,"Disappointing for Guy Ritchie","Fan of many films by guy ritchie but this was a let down. Bad acting and a weak predictable story. Collin Fararrell just about saved this film with the stereotypical funny Irishman. Suprised they let bugsy malone (rapper) feature so much in this film too having his cringy song mid film and end credits. I am a fan of Charlie Hannam but he can not do a british accent to save his life. The role he played should have been an American character as the entire film he sounded mumbled and mixed American, Irish, manc, scouse and every other type of strange tongue making his character awkward to watch. Doubt I'd watch this for a second time."
"1382","The Gentlemen",1,"Really? Unwatchable.","The 4 of us gave it an hour, but it was confusing, disjointed, and unwatchable. I don't understand what all of the people who gave it 8+ saw. We're in the minority, but save your money and time."
"1383","The Gentlemen",2,"Mediocre roles, mediocre plot, mediocre director","It was one thousand plus something years ago G. Richie did two his cool ones - ""Lock, Stock..."" and ""Snatch"".
There's nothing decent in this one - no plot, no well played parts, no dialogues, no faces, only self-repeating. Just compare Pitt with his unforgettable accent in ""Snatch"" and Farrell here..."
"1384","The Gentlemen",1,"Like a privileged adolescent trying desperately to impress adults at a party","A dull film that is trying way too hard to be edgy and fun. Non of the characters ring true in any shape or form - sounding exactly like the rich actors trying their best to be ""hard"" and ""street"" that they are. The plot is predictable. The comedy tone deaf and flat. Truly an annoying privileged teen wanting to impress the adults. Oh and the joke at an animal's expense towards the end is painfully try-hard and beyond obvious. I got a free ticket. I'd suggest you don't pay for the renos on his country estate with your patronage."
"1385","The Gentlemen",3,"I was bored to death by this","This film was such a bore to me. Everything here was done 100 times before, the film had a somewhat childlish plot with little to none creativity and imagination. I couldn't connect to any of the characters and I really wanted the film to end as soon as possible. The only positive thing about this movie is the costumes which is delightful, overall I would say this is a waste of time and money."
"1386","The Gentlemen",9,"A great film","Here we go again. This film is another proof that the most of so called ,film critics' have no clue what's a good film and what's not. The fact that an idiotic film by Rian Johnson (The Last Jedi) has high reviews and this has low reviews is disheartening.It's a great watch, and while at some points it may seem tedious, I would say the first 30 minutes pass rather slowly, it gets more and more interesting as it nears its end. Hugh Grant delivers a great performance, and everyone else is equally brilliant.Ignore all the bad reviews, here's a film that everyone can enjoy. I have watched it with my younger sister, and we both liked it."
"1387","The Gentlemen",2,"Waste of time","Apart from Matthew McConaughey, the acting is terrible.
Even worse script.
Couldn't watch it."
"1388","The Gentlemen",3,"Ritchie has lost it completely","I'm not one to come here to write reviews but after seeing all the reviews here I feel I need to add my opinion. The film starts out with High Grant sounding like a David Williams, little Britton hard man talking to Charlie Hunnam doing his best Tom hardy impression. This goes on for most of the film with some incredibly weak dialogue which really struggle to keep you interested. McConaugheys character is very similar to his character out of true detective which is fairly enjoyable but nothing new. Now the rest of the story has a few entertaining moments and Colin Farrell is great but there really isn't anything else to enjoy. The story is trying to be upto date but just shows how out of touch Ritchie really is and you can pretty much predict the whole story as it folds out. Also the less said about the movie script ending the better. I really recommend you skip this film and save you're money. I used a gift card and still felt like I got a bad deal."
"1389","The Gentlemen",5,"Play a game with me, Guy.","'The Gentlemen (2020)' is fine, consistently engaging and occasionally quite fun. It does have a plethora of problems, though. First of all, it's never quite clear just who we're supposed to be rooting for. This doesn't feel intentional and seems to be the result of its odd, flashback-based structure. There isn't a great sense of escalation and the pace remains mostly consistent. The narrative doesn't catch up with itself until far too late and, even then, it's annoying how most of the story is told via narrated exposition to someone apparently directly involved with most of its events. Secondly, the flick is simply an amalgamation of genre tropes and stock characters, almost exactly what you expect from a Guy Ritchie movie that isn't 'Aladdin (2019)'. The characters aren't really given the time necessary to develop properly; they're always walking stereotypes. Some of them even seem like stand-ins for the director himself, with talk of ""proper cinema"" and references to films like 'The Conversation (1973)' being ""a bit boring"". Finally, the flick is kind of racist. Almost every character makes some kind of racist remark, mainly against members of Asian and Black communities, and it's often used for supposed 'humour'. The worst offence is probably when a major character says another has a 'black heart' while specifically referencing race. The flick's treatment of women isn't much better, with the only female character coming under the threat of rape just so she can be violently saved by a white man. It all feels outdated, like someone scrambling against apparent 'PC gone mad'. Plus, a lot of time is strangely spent trying to justify its problematic elements; characters have discussions about whether or not certain racist remarks are actually racist. All of this results in an affair that only sours with time, staying in your mind just long enough for you to consider its faults and then slipping away into complete obscurity. It's really forgettable, probably because it's so generic. It's not terrible, though. As I mentioned, it's often quite enjoyable and it's always engaging. Hugh Grant's scene-stealing performance is a real highlight, too. It's messy and misjudged but it's entertaining enough to keep you in your seat. 5/10"
"1390","The Gentlemen",1,"Disappointing","I'm a fair person and usually easily entertained.
This one is worth slipping for sure. Couple hours I'll never get back."
"1391","The Gentlemen",1,"Guy Ritchie is done.","What I hate the most in life, is paying for something I hated...my hard earned money for your poor attempt to slap together what you think is a motion picture, Guy! You could sit at a boulevard and beg for change and it would have been more dignified than to ask for $14 for this piece of work. Next time I'm using torrent to Dl your movie."
"1392","The Gentlemen",1,"Awful Movie","What has everyone been smoking? This movie was awful. Extremely boring and confusing. I couldn't wait for it to be over."
"1393","The Gentlemen",1,"Too much talking. Not enough of a movie!!","Way way too much dialogue and not enough of a real movie. I literally walked out of the theater about 1/3 into this mess. Don't waste your money. Wait until it's in Netflix or Amazon. Seriously. That's the best advice you'll ever get on this movie."
"1394","The Gentlemen",8,"Clever Funny Sophisticated Crime romp","Our 2nd new Movie of the year was so opposite to Little Women in character but turned out just as enjoyable in a very different way.My Review - The Gentleman. My Rating 8.5 /10The trailers for The Gentlemen doesn't give a lot away and either will my Review except to say if you enjoyed the classic black comedy In Bruges (2008) with Colin Farrell,who is one of ""The Gentlemen "" or Guy Ritchie's ""The Snatch ""2000 you should really enjoy this film.If really full on swearing especially the 'C"" word offends you ( it doesn't bother me at all if it fits the characters but it may not be your cup of tea.
There is violence more implied and not graphic and the plots fast paced and convoluted but it's so clever and original and very very funny in parts .I'm really looking forward to seeing it again to catch up on a few plot lines that passed me by.
The performances are all top class especially Hugh Grant who I've never considered a really great actor but I've change my mind after today.
In fact his performances in the last few films he's been in like A Very English Scandal and Paddington 2 up until The Gentlemen I would say have been his best acting roles.
He is cast in The Gentlemen as Fletcher a Private Investigator trying to fleece $20 million from a British gangster hit man cartel . Hugh Grant's performance in my opinion is the funniest detective role to come along since Peter Sellers Chief Inspector Clouseau . He's brilliant as the very camp cunningly conniving Fletcher and his East end drawl is incredibly clever acting .Often fine performances are due to a good director and Guy Ritchie who directed and wrote the screenplay for The Gentlemen has excelled in this film .
I enjoyed this more than the recent ""Knives Out "" film which was very good but The Gentlemen I think is in a Class similar to the late Blake Edwards at his best.The other stand out performances are from Academy Award winner Matthew McConaughey as Mickey Pearson an American expat who became rich by building a marijuana empire in London .
A Simplified version of the plot is that when word gets out that Mickey is looking to cash out his business,it soon triggers an array of plots and schemes from those who want his fortune.Michelle Dockery completely buries any vision of herself as Lady Mary from Downton Abbey in the Gentlemen in her role as Mickey's wife and business partner with a hot gangster moll outfit and figure to match and some red hot lines to match,she's sensational in this role .In fact all the performances are good we see Henry Golding step out of his nice Asian dude character from Crazy Rich Asians and an angel in Last Christmas to play Dry Eye a young gangster protege trying to take over the territory from his Uncle Wang Young. Harlie Hunam as Raymond and Colin Farrell as Coach also give stand out performances
I was really surprised and delighted by how much I enjoyed The Gentlemen and look forward to seeing it again."
"1395","The Gentlemen",9,"Great fillum","Best movie I've seen at the cinemas since the departed"
"1396","The Gentlemen",5,"What's all the fuss?","A boring overdone movie with bad character choices, annoying actors. A movie trying to hard, with maybe a couple of okay scenes. Watch if it's for free but nothing amazing. Zzzzz bit cringey if anything."
"1397","The Gentlemen",1,"Waste of money","Pathetic movie. It does get exciting in the end but an absolute waste of money!"
"1398","The Gentlemen",6,"Good","With a great cast strong music and a fine script Ritchie gives us a good film which it can be compared with his older snatch.Relax and enjoy!"
"1399","The Gentlemen",6,"A mildly entertaining...","A mildly entertaining but ultimately valueless piece of cinema or film. There are far better purveyors of mindless violence around if that's your thing - unoriginal and nothing you haven't seen before. Poor person's Tarantino at best."
"1400","The Gentlemen",5,"Ritchie lost all of the orginality he once had","Lock,Stock and Two Smoking Barrels is one of my favorite comedies of all time... and The Gentlemen is trying to be that and Snatch but massively fails. The jokes aren't funny, the whole movie's humor is based around racist and sexual jokes... The plot is quite simple and all the characters are unlikeable, like I didn't care for any of the characters. Also, the rape scene was so out of the place. Yes the movie is entertaining but I don't think it adds something new to Ritchie's filmography (feels like recycled stuff from his other movies) and I don't think I will watch this again soon."

Well, I'll start with McConaughey. He played his role far too straight. He was completely deadpan. Not at any point was there a twinkle in his eye. His wife, Rosalind Pearson, wouldn't look out of place on the set of EastEnders, what, with her obnoxious attitude and aggression. So, as a duo, I was completely detached from them. I certainly wasn't hoping they'd survive being eliminated by their foes. In fact, I was hoping they would come a cropper.I felt the boxing club lads - who recorded their exploits - deserved some punishment for pinching McConaughey's plants and equipment. Yet it was their coach, Farrell, who had to face the consequences of the boys' actions. Yes, he put himself forward, but the lads got off far too easy. I'm guessing the boxing lads were not challenged due to them being (majority) black. Because if you have McConaughey's (majority) white henchmen pasting them AND the Chinese outfit, well, it might appear a little racist. I wouldn't have thought that as a viewer. I also recall reading a review which stated if you take your eyes off the screen for one moment you will lose track of the script. I have to say, I didn't find the picture complicated at all. Not at any point did I feel I wasn't aware of the motivations. I even büggéred off around the 70 minute mark to change my bedding without pausing the film and returned to it without any problems.It is unlikely I will watch this again. It certainly doesn't have the snappy dialogue or the lasting appeal of Lock, Stock and Snatch."

"1403","Animal Crackers",8,"Where did THIS lucky find come from??","I dug this up a little while back and now that I heard the great news that Netflix is adding it this month, I figured I'd leave my review.
Despite its obscure release and generally insignificant existence, this movie was particularly impressive. The voice cast was perfect, animation nicely fluid and colorful with an entertaining story. Of course, there were the couple random scenes where you felt, 'What are they thinking?' Or 'Why didn't they just do this?'
But all in all, it was a delightfully amusing film that I enjoyed watching (along with my nephews/niece ranging from 12 to 5 yrs). They thought the hamster bit was hilarious!"
"1404","Animal Crackers",7,"Very cute movie","This is an enjoyable film. Viewers shouldn't go into this expecting Pixar, nor a lot of humor. This is a cute and fun story, albeit a somewhat cookie-cutter plot line. The performances are good, the overall story line holds together, and it offers a decent ending. It never came across as boring or juvenile (a flaw of many poor animations). It should prove entertaining for children and adults alike. I especially enjoyed the husband-wife relationship of the two main characters; they were well-developed and well-portrayed. A bit of cliche here, but fun cliche. Well worth watching."

"1407","Animal Crackers",7,"Oh, What a Circus!","GRADE: B-THIS FILM IS RECOMMENDED.IN BRIEF: Fine animation is once again upstaged by a weak unfocused book.JIM'S REVIEW: Animal Crackers, an independent animated feature by Scott Sava has been languishing on the shelves for a number of years and has slowly resurfaced with the help of Netflix and some courtroom action. But it is the Shakespearian plotting behind-the-scenes narrative that is a more interesting story than the actual plot of the movie. Set to be released in 2017, the film was plagued with financial difficulties and political intrigue after it was bought by Weinstein Studios and resold to Chinese businessmen who interfered with the filmmaker's initial vision. Court fights and personal debt plagued the animator until recently when a certain streaming service became his lifesaver.The film itself is a mix of creative ideas, some very well done, others unfulfilled. Based on Mr. Sava's graphic novel and inspired by those edible childhood favorite cookies, the meandering and far too convoluted scenario begins its tale with a flashback involving two brothers named Horatio and Bob Huntington who own a circus. Their eventual falling-out over a gypsy girl, Talia, leads to tragic results, which brings us to the main storyline about their nephew and present-day circus owner, Owen, his wife, Zoe, and their possession of a magical box of animal treats.Directed by Mr. Sava and Tony Bancroft who show off enough craftsmanship from their animation department, the film follows the fate of many animated features suffering from a story that is sub-par to the visuals. A visual delight throughout, the film is undernourished by its aforementioned rambling script, written by Dean Lorey and Mr. Sava. Their plot becomes such a jumble of unprocessed notions, although I am not sure where the blame goes due to the real-life background behaviors and the mishandling of the film. Nevertheless, the well-rendered animation itself is definitely worth viewing.The major snag with the film is its scattershot screenplay. The first half hour is merely story exposition and character development before it even kicks into the plot mechanics about the box of magical animal crackers. Then the customary action and chase sequences follow with an overabundance of snappy tune montages that do little to advance the story, except to wow you with its wonderful computer-generated visuals. Yes, there is much too see, yet too little to ponder.But behold the film's animation skills! They may be on overdrive, with rarely a quiet moment and desperate to impress the shortest of attention spans from the youngest of moviegoers. Still, the overall look of the film is superb, for viewers of any age, with its vivid primary color palette, stylized backgrounds, and the filmmaker's obsession to the simplest details. Character design is inventive and each exaggerated figure expresses its own unique personality and sense of wonder.And what a cast they have assembled! Voiceovers are provided by a high pedigree of skilled actors: Married couple John Krasinski and Emily Blunt as Owen and Zoe, Sir Ian McKellan and Gilbert Gottfried are the antagonists, with fine supporting work by Danny DeVito, Sylvester Stallone, Raven-Symoné, Patrick Warburton, and Harvey Fierstein. All bring their A-game to the project.Bear McCleary's lively score includes original songs by the likes of Michael Bublé, Huey Lewis and the News, Howard Jones, and Toad the Wet Sprocket, most of which are forgettable ditties. One can see the care and lavishness doted on this personal project by so many talented people,especially noticeable is Mr. Cava's earnest passion to his ""pet"" project (pun intended)Despite all the love and heartache given to this independent project and some wonderful style and flair, the end result is ultimately lacking focus. Animal Crackers has just too many half-baked ideas to become the proper cinematic sustenance it wants to be. Still one hopes Mr. Cava has better luck on his deservingly future projects."
"1408","Animal Crackers",7,"""Good Things Come in Small Crackers""","Really good watch, would watch again, and can recommend: probably better for younger audiences.This is a very good example of a family movie that tries to be for the entire family without being too obvious about it. It takes the serious bits and makes them palatable for a younger audience, and takes the magical bits and makes them more complex for older audiences.The voice casting was excellent, they managed to stack the cast with celebrity voice actors (normally a death sentence as they don't all play well together) without me noticing, which is a sign of a good voice actor: that they feel natural in the character.The writing actually seemed to be pretty decent, if formulaic, but I would have preferred a different antagonist scenario. The movie is all about family, born or chosen, and how great it is to be together, but both Mr. Woodley and Horatio embody the opposite of that so while it makes sense from a literary standpoint, it didn't feel intuitive for this movie. A scenario where it is all about working together to overcome someone / something (like a chief investor in the circus or a rival circus) would have been preferable, but both story lines were resolved in the expected manner.This isn't going to be a deep movie, but it was certainly fun to (mostly) turn my brain of for a bit and enjoy it."
"1409","Animal Crackers",7,"Really Good...Not Great..But Good Enough","If you're a parent checking reviews for ""Family Movie Night"", and you go in to this with moderate expectations, you're family will be entertained. The animation is on par with Abominable or Madagascar so rest assured it's not a cheaply made production. Harmless plot with no agenda. My 9 year old son loved it and I wasn't glued to my phone out of boredom (my own rating system). If I reach for the phone in the first 10 minutes I'm in for a rough 90 mins of kid, cinema, torture. This one's absolutely good enough for a family movie night. No phone required, so go for it!"

"1413","Animal Crackers",7,"Slightly messy film is saved by its humor, heart, and passion.","Animal Crackers was a rather pleasant surprise. Despite being based on Animal Cracker cookies of all things, the movie managed to exceed my expectations with its creativity, humor, style, and voice acting. The movie follows Owen and Zoe Huntington who, along with their daughter, inherit not only Owen's uncle's Circus, but also a box of Animal Crackers that allows who ever eats them to take the form of that animal. But that's an EXTREMELY paired down synopses because there's also a long standing feud with Owen's still living uncle Horatio, animosity between Owen and his father in law, a subplot involving a dog biscuit flavor like people food, and a few other speed bumps along the way. However, while the story can sometimes feel overcluttered with too many moving parts, it does make up for it with its creativity and economically delivered style. This is not a Pixar or Dreamworks movie so it's best to set your expectations before hand. With that said, despite this being an independently produced animated film it still looks vibrant with lots of details including a very well staged scene set to Queen's Don't Stop Me Now that's filled with creative transitions, smooth animation, and vibrant colors. The movies third act falls apart at the end especially since the antagonists does an abrupt turn and changes character from an egotistical jerk to a power mad villain bent on world domination(yes, seriously), but even despite its faults I do recommend it because it is well made, the performances are well delivered with good chemistry between the actors and you can certainly do worse in terms of family films. So marginal recommendation."
"1414","Animal Crackers",4,"Pretty much explains why this movie spent three years stuck in distribution hell","'Animal Crackers' is an animation movie with a complete mediocre story line and boring characters design.

"1415","Animal Crackers",4,"Animation and voice acting is great","And that's about it.The art looks like a mass produced TV show for kids, and the design on most of the characters are boring and generic. The story is all over the place with a main plot that's super easy to predict.I'm not great at guessing plots, and I guessed the ending within the first 10 minutes.Boring subplots and cheap art, the movie is saved by the voice acting and the animation work, and if you have kids to love the cirkus and you are already paying for Netflix, then give it a watch"

"1417","Animal Crackers",9,"I must be an easy date","Because I thoroughly enjoyed this new-old film despite, or in spite of, my advanced age of 51. Great, strong actors and a family dynamic with much heart and love. The dialogue is smart and doesn't condescend to the audience. Sure, the plot could be seem as stale as those cookies, but the fun animation, exuberance of the actors, and exciting action make an oft-used plot feel new.
Finally, there is no moralizing about a topic du jour, unless, maybe, one thinks an unbreakable familial bond is preaching."

That idea is awesome, not to mention a handful of jokes here and there that let out a chuckle, the animation is also solid in most spots for the most part. The voice acting is solid. My issue is the overlapping plot points, inconsistent story, very bland unoriginal script and dialogue between characters with almost little to zero development. Very all around the mill Below average animated film. Not that bad, but certainly not good."

"1423","The Shawshank Redemption",10,"Some birds aren't meant to be caged.","The Shawshank Redemption is written and directed by Frank Darabont. It is an adaptation of the Stephen King novella Rita Hayworth and Shawshank Redemption. Starring Tim Robbins and Morgan Freeman, the film portrays the story of Andy Dufresne (Robbins), a banker who is sentenced to two life sentences at Shawshank State Prison for apparently murdering his wife and her lover. Andy finds it tough going but finds solace in the friendship he forms with fellow inmate Ellis ""Red"" Redding (Freeman). While things start to pick up when the warden finds Andy a prison job more befitting his talents as a banker. However, the arrival of another inmate is going to vastly change things for all of them.There was no fanfare or bunting put out for the release of the film back in 94, with a title that didn't give much inkling to anyone about what it was about, and with Columbia Pictures unsure how to market it, Shawshank Redemption barely registered at the box office. However, come Academy Award time the film received several nominations, and although it won none, it stirred up interest in the film for its home entertainment release. The rest, as they say, is history. For the film finally found an audience that saw the film propelled to almost mythical proportions as an endearing modern day classic. Something that has delighted its fans, whilst simultaneously baffling its detractors. One thing is for sure, though, is that which ever side of the Shawshank fence you sit on, the film continues to gather new fans and simply will never go away or loose that mythical status.It's possibly the simplicity of it all that sends some haters of the film into cinematic spasms. The implausible plot and an apparent sentimental edge that makes a nonsense of prison life, are but two chief complaints from those that dislike the film with a passion. Yet when characters are this richly drawn, and so movingly performed, it strikes me as churlish to do down a human drama that's dealing in hope, friendship and faith. The sentimental aspect is indeed there, but that acts as a counterpoint to the suffering, degradation and shattering of the soul involving our protagonist. Cosy prison life you say? No chance. The need for human connection is never more needed than during incarceration, surely? And given the quite terrific performances of Robbins (never better) & Freeman (sublimely making it easy), it's the easiest thing in the world to warm to Andy and Red.Those in support aren't faring too bad either. Bob Gunton is coiled spring smarm as Warden Norton, James Whitmore is heart achingly great as the ""Birdman Of Shawshank,"" Clancy Brown is menacing as antagonist Capt. Byron Hadley, William Sadler amusing as Heywood & Mark Rolston is impressively vile as Bogs Diamond. Then there's Roger Deakins' lush cinematography as the camera gracefully glides in and out of the prison offering almost ethereal hope to our characters (yes, they are ours). The music pings in conjunction with the emotional flow of the movie too. Thomas Newman's score is mostly piano based, dovetailing neatly with Andy's state of mind, while the excellently selected soundtrack ranges from the likes of Hank Williams to the gorgeous Le Nozze di Figaro by Mozart.If you love Shawshank then it's a love that lasts a lifetime. Every viewing brings the same array of emotions - anger - revilement - happiness - sadness - inspiration and a warmth that can reduce the most hardened into misty eyed wonderment. Above all else, though, Shawshank offers hope - not just for characters in a movie - but for a better life and a better world for all of us. 10/10"
"1424","The Shawshank Redemption",10,"Tied for the best movie I have ever seen","Why do I want to write the 234th comment on The Shawshank Redemption? I am not sure - almost everything that could be possibly said about it has been said. But like so many other people who wrote comments, I was and am profoundly moved by this simple and eloquent depiction of hope and friendship and redemption. The only other movie I have ever seen that effects me as strongly is To Kill a Mockingbird. Both movies leave me feeling cleaner for having watched them.I didn't intend to see this movie at all: I do not like prison movies and I don't normally watch them. I work at a branch library and one day as I was checking The Shawshank Redemption out to one of our older patrons, she said to me, ""Whenever I feel down or depressed, I check out this movie and watch it and it always makes me feel better."" At the time, I thought that was very strange. One day there was nothing on TV except things I absolutely would not watch under any circumstance or things that I had seen too many times already. I remembered what she said, so I watched it. I have watched it many many times since then and it gets better with every showing.No action, no special effects - just men in prison uniforms talking to each other.The Shawshank Redemption and To Kill a Mockingbird are the best movies I have ever seen. I do not judge it by it's technical merits - I don't really care about that. I have read that Citizen Kane or The Godfather or this or that movie is the best movie ever made. They may have the best technique or be the most influential motion pictures ever made, but not the best. The best movies are ones that touch the soul. It takes a movie like The Shawshank Redemption to touch the soul."
"1425","The Shawshank Redemption",10,"Don't Rent Shawshank.","I'm trying to save you money; this is the last film title that you should consider borrowing. Renting Shawshank will cost you five bucks... just plunk down the $25 and own the title. You'll wind up going back to this gem time and time again. This is one of few movies that are truly timeless. And it's entertaining and moving, no matter how many times you view it.Forget about what others (including myself) might suggest you'll discover in ""The Shawshank Redemption;"" when you watch it, you'll identify something very personal in your own life with a scene, a character, or a moment in this uncomplicated movie. When you need hope, you'll look for Shawshank. When you want to believe in the will of overcoming even the greatest obstacles, Shawshank will uplift you in ways that you can't find in movies today. Some liken the film to some kind of spiritual awakening. Of course, some can go to a church or mosque to find enlightenment and Faith in humanity, but most places of worship are open only certain days or times. But when you need affirmation of the lasting bond of friendships that prevail over the most dire circumstances, Shawshank will give it to you. It makes grown men (like me) cry, still. I wonder whether Shawshank was truly meant for viewing in the privacy of the home, because it is a personal experience that really makes you look inward. Nominated for seven, this is the best film that never one a single Oscar. How ironic that an innocent man winds up being surrounded by the corruption of the legal system. Shawshank itself is similar to the character of Andy Dufresne. Prejudging this classic film, critics couldn't get past the title. The public followed suit, initially dismissing Shawshank, which failed in the box office just like ""It's a Wonderful Life"" and ""Citizen Kane."" It could have just whithered away on the store shelves, like Andy Dufresne could have in his own cell. But the characters prevailed, because Andy -- And Shawshank -- stayed true. Now, these movies are right up there as the most popular films of all time. Anyone who has yet to watch Shawshank may be so jaded of movies, or the film's title, or how a 2-1/2- hour movie set inside the walls of a prison can manage to tap the soul of such a wide range of people. Shawshank has not one explosion. I wonder if it even has a single special effect or digitally- enhanced frame. But every aspect of Shawshank fit together. The acting from the top to the bit part. The musical score. The editing. The photography. The story, from opening credits to final scene. All involved, including the town of Mansfield, Ohio (where Shawshank was actually filmed) played their roles perfectly. Shawshank is a must- see, must- own title."
"1426","The Shawshank Redemption",NA,"Prepare to be moved","I have never seen such an amazing film since I saw The Shawshank Redemption. Shawshank encompasses friendships, hardships, hopes, and dreams.  And what is so great about the movie is that it moves you, it gives you hope.  Even though the circumstances between the characters and the viewers are quite different, you don't feel that far removed from what the characters are going through.It is a simple film, yet it has an everlasting message.  Frank Darabont didn't need to put any kind of outlandish special effects to get us to love this film, the narration and the acting does that for him.  Why this movie didn't win all seven Oscars is beyond me, but don't let that sway you to not see this film, let its ranking on the IMDb's top 250 list sway you, let your friends recommendation about the movie sway you.Set aside a little over two hours tonight and rent this movie.  You will finally understand what everyone is talking about and you will understand why this is my all time favorite movie."
"1427","The Shawshank Redemption",10,"This is How Movies Should Be Made","This movie is not your ordinary Hollywood flick. It has a great and deep message. This movie has a foundation and just kept on being built on from their and that foundation is hope.Other than just the message of this movie the acting was phenomenal. Tim Robbins gave one of the greatest performances ever. He was inspiring, intelligent and most of all positive. His performance just made me smile. Robbins plays Andy Dufresne who was wrongfully convicted of murdering his wife and her lover. He is gets to life sentences but yet never gives up hope. In he becomes friends with Ellis Boyd ""Red"" Redding played by Morgan Freeman. Freeman who gives the finest performance of his career has unlike Robbins lost hope. He is in deep regret of the crime that he committed. His way of deflecting the pain away is by trying to not feel anything at all. With his friendship with Andy he learns that without our hopes and dreams we have nothing. Andy also becomes friends with the rest of Red's group. James Whitmore also gave a great performance as Brooks Halten who gets out of prison parole but in the words of Red he has been ""institutionalized"". The directing by Frank Darabont was just magnificent. He kept this movie at a great steady pace along with the writing and great cinematography. He portrayed prison life in such a horrifying way, but not in terms of the physical pain but the stress and pain that wares mentally on the inmates, some of which deserve a second chance. Whatever you do, don't listen to the people who say this movie is overrated because this is one of the most inspiring and greatest movies ever. It has everything you could possibly want."
"1428","The Shawshank Redemption",10,"Shawshank Redeems Hollywood","Can Hollywood, usually creating things for entertainment purposes only, create art?  To create something of this nature, a director must approach it in a most meticulous manner, due to the delicacy of the process.  Such a daunting task requires an extremely capable artist with an undeniable managerial capacity and an acutely developed awareness of each element of art in their films, the most prominent; music, visuals, script, and acting. These elements, each equally important, must succeed independently, yet still form a harmonious union, because this mixture determines the fate of the artist's opus.  Though already well known amongst his colleagues for his notable skills at writing and directing, Frank Darabont emerges with his feature film directorial debut, The Shawshank Redemption.  Proving himself already a master of the craft, Darabont managed to create one of the most recognizable independent releases in the history of Hollywood.  The Shawshank Redemption defines a genre, defies the odds, compels the emotions, and brings an era of artistically influential films back to Hollywood.The story begins with the trial of a young banker, Andy Dufrense, victimized by circumstantial evidence, resulting in a conviction for the murder of his wife and her lover.  After a quick conviction, Andy finds himself serving a life sentence at Shawshank prison, with no hope of parole.  He exists in this prison only in appearance, keeping his mind free from the drab walls around him.  His ability to do this results in the gaining of respect from his fellow inmates, but most of all from Ellis Redding.  Ellis, commonly referred to as Red, finds gainful use of his entrepreneurial spirit within the drab walls of Shawshank by dealing in contraband and commodities rare to the confines of prison.  Andy's demeanor and undeniable sense of hope causes Red to take a deeper look at himself, and the world around him.  Andy proves to Red and the other inmates that in the conventional walls of Shawshank prison convention will find no home in his lifestyle.By creating the film's firm foundation, the meticulously chiseled screenplay paved the way for this film's success.  Frank Darabont outdoes himself with the phenomenal adaptation of Stephen King's equally noteworthy novella, Rita Hayworth and Shawshank Redemption.  In this novella, King demonstrates that he can break free from the genre he dominates and still create a marvelous piece of modern literature.  Though the film mirrors the novella in many ways, Darabont illustrates a focused objective of improving upon the areas where the novella came up short, resulting in one of the best book to film transitions ever.While maintaining some of the poetic and moving dialogue of the novella, Darabont also proves that a film's score can generate a great deal of emotional response from its audience, as dialogue does.  He employs the cunning Thomas Newman, son of the legendary Hollywood composer, Alfred Newman.  Darabont shows recognition for the film's needs by employing Newman, who makes the gentle piano chords whisper softly to the viewer, as if a part of the scripted dialogue.  Newman lends himself to individualism and tends to drive more towards the unique in the realm of score composition.  His effort in Shawshank did not go unnoticed, as his score received an Oscar nomination in 1995.  While unique and independent, Newman's score never once intrudes on your concentration or distracts from the film.With work from vast array of talented scene designers, costume designers, composers, cinematographers, and various other Hollywood artists, the cast of The Shawshank Redemption had a strong foundation to work with.  The marvelous cast of this film will dazzle you with some of the most convincing performances you will witness in a film.  While both Tim Robbins and Morgan Freeman shine as Andy and Red, respectively, the true spectacle of acting lies within the plethora of amazing supporting actors who easily disappear into their roles.  Most noticeable of these, the veteran film star James Whitmore, who portrays the elderly Brooks Hatlen.  Brooks, a man incarcerated for an unmentioned crime for so long that he finds himself attached to the Shawshank and the daily life he has lead.  Each of these actors show a true dedication to their art, and a focused purpose in their motivations, creating a convincing setting that never once caters to anything unbelievable.With all of the aesthetic touches and attention to cinematic detail, the most beautiful part of the film lies within its thematic material, such as its focus on the human desires for the most abstract concepts, like hope and freedom.  These themes, which concern things the human spirit undoubtedly yearns for, seem so intricately woven into the plot that it easily draws its audience in to its story.  Though full of hardened criminals, your heart will go out to these men as they display the most basic of human emotions, and deliver some of the most quotable lines in a film to date.  Like a great novel, this film manages to succeed at greater things than simply entertaining an audience.  Darabont tells his story most masterfully, illustrating principles and inspiring his audience to think.  He leaves us a poignant film with a powerful message of hope, and redemption, something we all seek.This film manages to redeem Hollywood in the eyes of people who feared it long lost in a dark sea of clichés and predictability.  Darabont shows us that artists still work in the Hollywood studios and production facilities. These artists show their capability to produce art; real art that inspires you to look at the deeper aspects of life and the world around you.  The Shawshank Redemption delivers much-needed breath of fresh air for anyone who realizes the capability of film.  It proves that masters of the craft still live on this earth, and still bless us with timeless masterpieces that we will never forget."
"1429","The Shawshank Redemption",10,"Eternal Hope","I've lost count of the number of times I have seen this movie, but it is more than 20. It has to be one of the best movies ever made. It made me take notice Morgan Freeman and Tim Robbins like I had never noticed any actors before.I have from a very young age been a huge fan of anything Stephen King writes and had already read the short story that this movie is based on years prior to seeing this movie.Not everything Stephen King has written that gets turned into a movie comes out well, but this is as close to perfection as it gets and has everything you could ever want in a movie.Something that is outstanding is the fact that it has no real action, no special effects and no gimmicks. 99% of the movie is just men in a prison uniforms talking. Yet it absolutely hooks you almost from the beginning and has you glued to the screen to the end.For me what really makes this film one of the best is the message of eternal hope it conveys throughout. The never ever give up hope attitude of the main character so well conveyed by Tim Robbins. The ending is just spine tingling every time I see it, no matter how many times I have seen it.Brilliant, brilliant movie and a must see for everyone."
"1430","The Shawshank Redemption",10,"Stephen King's best adapted movie","Misery and Stand By Me were the best adaptations up until this one, now you can add Shawshank to that list.This is simply one of the best films ever made and I know I am not the first to say that and I certainly won't be the last. The standing on the IMDb is a true barometer of that. #3 as of this date and I'm sure it could be number 1. So I'll just skip all the normal praise of the film because we all know how great it is. But let me perhaps add that what I find so fascinating about Shawshank is that Stephen King wrote it.King is one of the best writers in the world. Books like IT and the Castle Rock series are some of the greatest stories ever told. But his best adaptations are always done by the best directors. The Shining was brilliantly interpreted by Kubrick and of course the aforementioned Misery and Stand By Me are both by Rob Reiner. Now Frank Darabont comes onto the scene and makes arguably the best King film ever. He seems to understand what King wants to say and he conveys that beautifully. What makes this film one of the best ever made is the message it conveys. It is one of eternal hope. Andy Dufresne, played by Tim Robbins, has been sent to prison for a crime he did not commit. But he never loses hope. He never gives up his quest to become a free man again. His years of tenacity, patience and wits keep him not only sane, but it gives his mind and a spirit a will to live. This film has a different feel to it. There has never been anything like it before and I don't know if there will again.I'm not going to say any more about this film, it has already been said, but just suffice to say that I am glad that Forrest Gump won best picture in 94. I would have been equally glad if Pulp Fiction or Shawshank would have won. It is that good of a movie and one that will be appreciated for years to come."
"1431","The Shawshank Redemption",10,"The Shawshank Redemption","One of the finest films made in recent years. It's a poignant story about hope. Hope gets me. That's what makes a film like this more than a movie. It tells a lesson about life. Those are the films people talk about 50 or even 100 years from you. It's also a story for freedom. Freedom from isolation, from rule, from bigotry and hate. Freeman and Robbins are majestic in their performances. Each learns from the other. Their relationship is strong and you feel that from the first moment they make contact with one another. There is also a wonderful performance from legend James Whitmore as Brooks.He shines when it is his time to go back into the world, only to find that the world grew up so fast he never even got a chance to blink. Stephen King's story is brought to the screen with great elegance and excitement. It is an extraordinary motion that people ""will"" be talking about in 50 or 100 years."
"1432","The Shawshank Redemption",10,"My favorite movie of all time.","The Shawshank Redemption has great performances, extremely well written script and story all leading to a deeply emotional climax! One of the best dramas of all time!"
"1433","The Shawshank Redemption",10,"Simply known as ""The Movie""","Whenever I talk about this movie with my friends, I do not even refer to it by title, but rather as ""The Movie"".  When I say ""The Movie"", my friends know exactly what I'm talking about.  In fact the main reason that me and my friends don't refer to it by title is because this movie is so great, that we do not feel worthy enough to say it's name in vain! I still remember the first time I saw The Shawshank Redemption.  Some friends of mine and I went to see it at one of those ""Budget Theaters"" over the summer of 1995.  None of us really knew anything about the movie, but we had heard that it was pretty good.  So, not having any real expectations, we saw it.  When the final credits rolled and the lights came on in the theater, all of us just sat there with our jaws hanging down on the floor. I turned my head towards my friend Bob and said ""That was the greatest movie I have ever seen in my entire life!"" There's really no other way I can put it in words.  Every moment of this movie captivated me and inspired me to believe in the one true thing in life...... ""HOPE"".  This movie is sad, uplifting, inspiring, harsh, cold, funny (at the right times), jaw-dropping, and heart-warming all at the same time.  I get chills every time I watch this film and this film contains the greatest ending (which takes place over the last 30 minutes or so)in movie history!  How it all just ""comes together"" is so incredible and uplifting. I should also mention the music in this movie is nearly flawless as well, and the soundtrack is a ""must buy"" for any music fan. The only bad thing about this movie is the fact that I know I will never see a better movie, no matter how many I may see.  I've seen many movies over the past few years, many excellent films.  However, every time I walk out of the theater, I turn to my friend or family member that I saw it with and I say, ""That was a great movie, but it wasn't nearly as good as 'you know what'!""  There have been many movies over the past few years that thought would really move me or that I might one day call my ""favorite of all time"", but they've all fallen far short of ""The Shawshank Redemption"". So, if you have yet to see this movie, please run to the video store immediately.  You're guaranteed to find it in the ""employee picks"" section. And if it isn't in that section, then you should tell the employees there that there is something seriously wrong with them.  If you have seen this movie, go see it again.  If you haven't bought your own copy yet, buy one. In fact buy two, and put one in a fire-proof safe, just in case of an emergency. :o) So, you want a 1-10 rating???  I give it a 13!!!!!!"
"1434","The Shawshank Redemption",10,"Oh my godmother","Three words: Oh. My. God.How am i supposed to describe this absolutely fantastic and unbelievable film in words? I don't know. But I'll give it a shot. Here goes.This movie is just bloody excellent, brilliant, fantastic, unbelievable, not a thing wrong with it, shocking (in a good way), heck, pretty much every single good comment word you can think of.I mean, for gods sake, its so damn good it takes your breath away! i seriously could not speak after it! it instantly took every other film i had seen under its shadow, and that's saying something, as i have seen some pretty excellent films.There's not a single actor or actress in this movie who is crap!!! standouts are Morgan freeman, Tim Robbins, and the dude who plays brooks.I could say 1239643609260246704272628xinfinity more things good about this movie, but unfortunately I haven't got that much space, and my fingers would get sore.An absolute must see for everyone, and I'm positive that ill never see another movie better than this, and this will stay at #1 on my list forever."
"1435","The Shawshank Redemption",10,"its an excellent piece of art","i watch this movie for minimum 5-6 times first to last. so every time i enjoyed as i watching it first time. its a piece of art. and we now know how to entertain with no action or fighting scenes. its a pure drama that anyone can enjoy with family in silence. so i rate this movie 10 out of 10 because of amazing screen play, acting, casting, background scoring editing etc. this is my first movie review so pardon me if i did any mistake."
"1436","The Shawshank Redemption",10,"Prison thriller with violence, hatred, corruption, friendship and joy.","""The Shawshank Redemption"" is a timeless story of heartbreak, deception and ultimate growth under the most deplorable conditions. The acting is superior, some of Tim Robbins' and Morgan Freeman's best work as they allow me an intimate look inside the sometimes contradictory nature of a convict's existence, where I am torn emotionally between danger and safety, light and shadow, sanity and sorrow, truth and lies, injustice and justice. In fact, I am lost in all the actors' poignant and memorable portrayals of young thugs, cruel guards, swindlers, thieves, rapists and murders, all standing in their respective spaces quietly listening together to an operatic aria over a loudspeaker on the prison yard.In this movie, I find almost no one to be all good or all bad. There are exceptions, though. Although there are those in charge of the prison I wish to be caught in a snare of their own making or worse, there are still others behind prison walls that turn out to be heroes I cheer on to win in the end. Like people in real life, most of the characters in ""The Shawshank Redemption,"" both prisoners and guards (those that are not miserably rotten to the bone), represent many shades of gray.One of the most touching moments in ""The Shawshank Redemption"" is a scene in which an elderly convict, who has spent the better part of his adult life locked up, is brokenheartedly paroled into a modern world that is as alien to him as his outdated suit and boyhood memories. And his fear of this new and unnatural terrain, crawling with shadier creatures than those he had known behind bars and the exhaust fumes of a thousand horseless carriages rushing past, engulfed him with no hope of ever escaping.""Fear can hold you prisoner. Hope can set you free,"" from ""The Shawshank Redemption.""As bonds form between people of different ethnic groups, economic backgrounds and intellectual levels, I rejoice in their discovery of the human dignity they share. As the story unfolds, my heart hurts so hard, I cry. Then, with tears still in my eyes, I laugh, the same way my family used to laugh together at dinner or a movie when I was a little girl.Getting older. Times changing. People leaving. Dying. But at the core of the main character's spirit there shines upon all those who are within its range, including me, a contagious hope eternal. I am still astonished with the euphoria that fills my being each time I view this incredible story about the invincible human spirit."
"1437","The Shawshank Redemption",10,"This is a wonderful movie!!!!","When I first see it, I am too young to understand all the things the movie what to show us. The film gave me a very different feeling. Hope is a dangerous thing, is the root of mental distress. Because since come in the day, the warden said, ""the soul to god, the body to me.""Except that he can get the cigarettes and naked woman printed CARDS and any other changes I can't seem to grow within the walls of the dark. However Andy told him, ""remember, hope is a good thing - and perhaps even good. And no good thing will never disappear."" So Andy can use 20 years digging Red think can chisel in tunnel in six hundred.When he finally climbed out of the five hundred yards of the stench of sewage pipes, standing in the pouring rain can't help, we seem to see faith Pierce heavy darkness, played a luminous in the dark of the night out of the blue.Under the light, the soul of our weak under Andy with open arms in the sky in succession, and shaking."
"1438","The Shawshank Redemption",10,"Hope can set you free and so can this remarkable film","One of my favorite movies ever,The Shawshank Redemption is a modern day classic as it tells the story of two inmates who become friends and find solace over the years in which this movie takes place.Based on a Stephen King novel,this movie makes us feel different watching this film than most others as this is an incredibly realistic film.Tim Robbins stars as Andy Dufresne who is convicted of murder and Morgan Freeman as Ellis Boyd ""Red"" Redding who is a fellow inmate and close friend of Dufresne and Bob Gunton as Warden Samuel Norton who is the Warden of Shawshank State Prison and is a character who has mixed feelings and emotions towards everyone around him and a character who is sometimes easy to like and at other times easy to despise.This film is easily considered one of the greatest films of all time and I definitely agree with this fact.It was nominated for seven Academy Awards including (Best Picture, Best Actor <U+0096> Morgan Freeman, Best Adapted Screenplay, Best Cinematography, Best Editing, Best Original Score, and Best Sound) but didn't win any due to tough competition from the film Forrest Gump.I personally think that Tim Robbins should have been nominated for the Best Actor award as he really gave the performance of his career.Bravo to this brilliant modern day classic!"
"1439","The Shawshank Redemption",10,"A movie revolution upon all others","We have all see movies, comedies, action and dramas. We all liked ones, hated others, got into some other even and felt like part of it. In Shawshank Redemption; you start slowly, after a while you get attached, by the time you reach the middle of the movie you simply totally forget about anything outside the screen and feel a mixed stream of emotions going through you head before anything else! then comes a last 20 minutes of heart storming that is surely enough to raise the adrenaline to extreme levels even in diabetics! I felt warm, strong, happy and all other emotions one can think of, I felt I was the one who won, who got out of prison, i was simply fully satisfied.This movie must be used as an Anti-depression by therapists! this movie proves that Oscars are either money bought gifts! or that who ever in charge of them are so smart that they couldn't give any Oscar to The Shawshank Redemption knowing that the movie is on different - much higher- rating scale than the Oscars.. it's simply over qualified!"
"1440","The Shawshank Redemption",10,"From my favorite movies..","It is one of the best movies in the world that many people will join me. Watching very, very impressed. What it might be called the great stories of Stephen King anyway. Acting on cues can say is enormous. There's no posturing. Especially when Andy Dufrense incredible music that review still stands wandering on everyone's lips. Finale as you lose yourself in it is a movie you are getting into. Finals if he so exhilarating you a high-quality music. And finding that deserves really deserve. I watched this film very young age and it has taught me that the magic of cinema in a nice way. This film is one of the reasons I hate the Oscars. Will remain as the best film in more than 10 years, I believe wholeheartedly sites. Definitely one of the best films in the world."
"1441","The Shawshank Redemption",9,"10 out of 10","Don't want to say any words about this film. Just a perfect 10."
"1442","The Shawshank Redemption",10,"Greatest movie of all time!","This movie is one of my all time favorites. Undoubtedly, one of the most brilliant movies I have ever seen. Story, cast, screenplay all are great. The directing by Frank Darabont was just magnificent. The amazing casting of both Morgan Freeman and Tim Robbins is amazing, and couldn't be more accurate. It was narrated by Morgan Freeman, who is the best narrator in Hollywood, I believe. Actually the film depends on the story and the way in which it unravels. It will change the way u think about things around u. Surely, It will teach you one thing that it is easy to take away a man's bread, even his freedom, but impossible to take away his hope.I can say with confidence this is the best movie I have ever seen - or ever will see. If you haven't watch it yet, just GO! Watch it! Now!"
"1443","The Shawshank Redemption",10,"I make the questions here!","It has a formula that gives you this kick; Darn what a good movie! But I need to say this, sometimes it happens.. So WHY do people love this movie and rate it high, when, or WHY isn't the ""smart"" people declare it like a a peace of art? Or do they?! Still I think it's darn good...but I bet the producer(s) didn't expect that!Like when we vote, for anything, we need to follow our heart. This is a typical movie that is worth every penny, every letter... and it's a typical 90' movie! Oh.. there we have it! Between gone with the wind and now, we NEED this! Love me as I am.. says the storyline, in my head anyway. And I do, yes I do!"
"1444","The Shawshank Redemption",10,"The Greatest Movie of all Time","Could a movie be any more perfect? This movie is just absolutely stunning in so many ways. Acting perfect, storyline perfect, soundtrack perfect, emotional drama perfect, everything about this movie is perfect.When this movie first came out it did not reach the expectations that many people expected it to. But as the years went one it was nominated for seven Academy Awards and as it was available for rent everywhere more people started appreciating it and it's popularity grew. Eventually after many years in the top 5 of IMDb's top 250 movies of all time list, it hit number 1 with over one million votes.The story is about a well educated vice president of a large bank being wrongly accused of murdering his wife and her lover and is sentenced to spend life at a large prison in new England called Shawshank prison. As the years go on in his new home he makes friends, enemys and a dramatic twist at the end which became one of the most legendary scenes in movie history.I love this movie. The acting is just so passionate and their performances increases the drama and horror of life in prison. The soundtrack is one of the main reason behind the emotional drama this movie. Many scenes in this movie almost left me in tears mainly because of the soundtrack in the background which increases the emotion. The cast of this movie include Academy Awards winners Morgan Freeman and Tim Robbins. And also William Sadler, Bob Gunton and many other who made this movie what it is.Overall it is defiantly the Greatest movie ever made with passionate acting, great storyline and plenty of emotional drama about how hope overcomes fear in a beautifully crafted film about the strength of the human spirit."
"1445","The Shawshank Redemption",10,"The closest thing to poetic perfection Hollywood has ever produced","This touching and heart warming film is the most perfect celebration of the human spirit I have seen. Andy Dufresne, wrongly convicted of murdering his wife and her lover, finds the strength not only to change himself, but to bring hope to those around him in Shawshank Prison.  This inspiring story is interwoven with a soundtrack which invokes every emotion, from haunting and chilling, to stirring and beautiful. When you go to see a movie and it touches you with its poetry, music, and its atmosphere, and leaves you with a sense of victorious satisfaction, it is a triumph.  Field of Dreams was the first movie which invoked these emotions in me.  Shawshank Redemption is even more powerful for its simplicity.  It doesn't pretend to be clean, nor could it be called a family movie.  It is brutal and violent at times, horrifying and sickening at others. However the title says it all. Redemption is what this story is all about.  And it is not necessarily redemption for the actual crimes you might have committed, but it is redemption for the way you have lived your life.  What emerges can only be called a maginificent piece of art.  This is what movies were meant to be."
"1446","The Shawshank Redemption",9,"Fantastic Film","This is a great film. It is well constructed, the acting is superb and the characters are so likeable or in the case of the pigs so detestable."
"1447","The Shawshank Redemption",NA,"Masterpiece","Shawshank Redemption, The (1994) **** (out of 4) An innocent man (Tim Robbins) is sent to prison on murder charges and once there he bonds with another man (Morgan Freeman) serving a life sentence. I remember seeing this when it was first released to theaters and walking out thinking it was a masterpiece but apparently others couldn't be bothered to see it since the box office results were very low and it was out of theaters in no time. Over the years the reputation of this film has grown and as I write this it's currently #1 at IMDb. I certainly wouldn't call this the greatest film ever made but it's certainly one of them. I think it's an insult to call this a prison movie because it's so much more than that. This is a film about friendship and hope. Those are two things that have played major parts in many movies but I can't think of too many films where the payoff is as large. What makes the film work so well is that director Durabont takes his time telling a story that takes place over twenty years. Another wonderful thing the director does is that he really makes the twenty years pass on a believable manor. Most films that jump time feel cheap and rushed but that's not the case here because the wonderful screenplay lets us get to know the two main character but also the supporting characters are very well written. What really brings this magic to life are the performances, which are downright brilliant and I'd argue that you can see some of the greatest ensemble acting right in this film. Robbins and Freeman are terrific together and really make for one of the most memorable friendships in movie history. The way Robbins walks and talks is perfectly done and I just love the way, as Freeman says in his narration, he walks around as if he didn't have a care in the world. Freeman gives another wonderful performance but what's really great about him is the narration he adds as he tells us the story. James Whitmore is terrific as the elderly convict and Clancy Brown and Bob Gunton make for excellent villains. I won't spoil the ending for anyone but the final twenty-minutes are at times breathtaking in their beauty and it's message of hope rings louder than most movies."
"1448","The Shawshank Redemption",10,"One of the most powerful movies I've ever watched","The characters are so well developped and well interpreted by the actors that you really feel for them which makes the whole story even more compeling. The structure builts up emotionnaly like only Darabont can do it. Breathtaking!"
"1449","The Shawshank Redemption",10,"life changing","I first saw this film, like many others, by chance and on DVD. And like others, I have since watched it over and over again. When I feel sad, it makes me feel happy, when I need hope, it gives me hope.When I want to reaffirm my very belief in life, and all it can offer, this film gives me a new sense of purpose that no other film has ever come close to doing.It soars above anything any other movie has tried to achieve in the way it touches on the true virtues of life itself. The portrayal of friendship, the devastation of loss and the maintaining of hope. Outstanding performances from the two leads and the most beautiful of narratives are the tip of the iceberg of why this film is so great. The cinematography from the very first shots of the prison are stunning and the accompanying soundtrack add to the haunting atmosphere when we first venture inside the prison walls. Thank you Mr Darabont, Mr Robins and Mr Freeman. Thank you to every one else involved. You changed my life"
"1450","The Shawshank Redemption",10,"A Truly Uplifting Film","Shawshank Redemption is without a doubt the most uplifting and touching film I have ever seen. It is the only movie I've seen that has made tears of happiness come to my eyes. I would (and do) recommend this film to anyone and everyone."
"1451","The Shawshank Redemption",10,"Enthralling, fantastic, intriguing, truly remarkable!","Shawshank Redemption is without doubt one of the best films ever made, and definitely the best film of 1994. Yes, it is better than Lion King, and I really like that too. It is not only enthralling but powerful and moving too. I will confess that I didn't understand it when I first saw it as a lot happens in the film, and I have now seen it three times. I seriously hope, that those who ignored the film when it was first released now recognise it as a great film, as it really is. The dialogue was extremely well-written, with lines that really stick in your mind. The cinematography and music are both gorgeous, and the prison itself is like a character that dominates the film. In the script, there are some true elements of Stephen King Now I admit I am not a huge king fan, and usually don't like coarse language in books. But in his books like It, which is very good, I have accepted the language represents brutality and rebellion, shown perfectly in the film with the battle of acceptance I suppose between the inmates and the superiors(like the scene with the warden yelling coarse language at the new inmates lined up in a row at the beginning.)The acting was exceptional. I am not hugely familiar with Tim Robbins, but he did a great job in a very demanding role. The best performance however, comes from Morgan Freeman as Red, who was seriously robbed of that Oscar, that he lost to Tom Hanks for Forrest Gump. Freeman reminds me very strongly, or his style of acting does, remind me of that of Sean Connery, suave yet very charismatic. Acting isn't just about your vocal range, it's about depth, which was what Freeman certainly had. In short, Freeman was brilliant in what could be his best performance. The scene where the inmates are listening to the Mozart aria over the speakers was a beautiful profound moment, and I actually cried in Brook's death scene. Very rarely do King adaptations translate-to screen well, because of the large scale of the author's books, with the exception of this and the Shining. Some like It and Dreamcatcher are genuinely memorable but have a number of flaws that prevent them from being classed as outstanding. And some, like Thinner and Tommyknockers that border on unwatchable. In conclusion Shawshank is a brilliant film, that is worthy of the credit it has been denied for so-long. 10/10 of course. Bethany Cox."
"1452","The Shawshank Redemption",10,"the Shawshank redemption is a world class film","the Shawshank redemption should be played throughout the world in all schools to teach people the hard life of prison but the bond between friends and the idea of hope. Morgan freeman is a second to none actor he lays the role perfectly and i could not think what the film would be like without him. all the other actors perform perfectly. this movie is a movie of inspiration and one of which will get people through harsh times. this film always restores my faith in mankind i simply love it. I first saw this film sitting on my brothers desk and i was intrigued by the idea of a film set in prison where hope and other morale values were the storyline instead of violence and havoc, this is a amazing film which brings pride to the actors and crew who produced it. the setting of the movie is one of perfection the Gothic grounds and the stunning facilities astound me i'am finding it hard to put in to words how much this film means to me i would say it is one of the greatest film's ever made in my time and i love it."

"1454","The Shawshank Redemption",10,"Hope!!!","I watched this movie for the umpteenth time probably last Sunday and how much I loved it yet again!!! A movie I would never ever get bored of and definitely, one of my all time favorites. A simple yet wonderful story about HOPE!!! HOPE  One word that drives all of us and gives us reason to live. We push ourselves through our mundane lives in the hope of achieving / finding something that we dream of. In the words of this movie's protagonist  ""hope is a good thing, maybe the best of things, and no good thing ever dies""!!! Superlative performances by Tim Robbins and Morgan Freeman.A must watch if you haven't!!!"
"1455","The Shawshank Redemption",10,"One of my favourites...","*******MINOR SPOILERS AHEAD**********The story begins with the court case of Andy dufresne for the alleged murder of his wife and her lover (the first few minutes at the start captivate you from the beginning)Andy is wrongly convicted and sent to Shawshank maximum security prison set with a double life sentence.Andy finds a new companion called Red(Morgan Freeman) the man who can get things for anyone in the prison for the right price. As a person that can get things or has been known to locate things from time to time for somebody Red doesn't find it particularly odd that andy asks him if he can get him Rita Hayworth in 1949.Of course he accepts.The line that defines this great piece of cinema is ""get busy living or get busy dying"".This movie is without a doubt one of my favourites and remember always- FEAR CAN HOLD YOU PRISONER HOPE CAN SET YOU FREE!"
"1456","The Shawshank Redemption",10,"great film","I can watch this film a hundred times and still enjoy it. Morgan Freeman is one of my favorite actors. And this must be his best roll ever. I thought Tim Robbins was definitely at his best in this film. All the prison guards and inmates were really believable. The story captures you from the beginning and doesn't let go until the final credits are rolled. This is the kind of film that make you think of how many inequities must exist in our prison system that no one ever hears about. Of all the the movies of this type the Shawshank Redemtion brings to light how good and evil can exist in every situation. And that nothing is black and white. But until it effect you its out of sight and out of mind."
"1457","The Shawshank Redemption",10,"really superb","i watched this movie just to pass out some good time... and you know what.. i had sore and wet eyes at the end.. i don't know why but the movie's end, couldn't stop myself..andy's portrayal by tim robbins and red's by morgan freeman was absolutely great..i like and love andy's philosophy that ""hope is a good thing.."" .. and i have tried to inculcate that in me.. i just loved the movie.. i was like.. whats this, its ended so fast.. i didn't it want to end.. i am not a con and neither i wanna be.. but it has shown even the guys out there in the prisons also can be innocent.. and to prove their innocence they can go to any lengths.. i mean that they also have got something in them.. their hearts.. the spirit shown by andy was absolutely great.. it shows that when you want to do something, do it with full heart.. i have just finished it..but i'm sure i m gonna watch this very often, and am not going to forget it for a long length of time.."
"1458","The Shawshank Redemption",10,"Without a doubt one of the best movies of all time","When I saw that the Shawshank Redemption was #1 on the top 250 movies of all time, I thought ""Yea, I could understand that"". I don't necessarily agree that it's absolutely the best, but it is so good that it makes sense that a forum of popular consensus for film rankings would rank it at the top.It is the story of Andy Dufresne, played by Tim Robbins and his time at Shawshank Prison. It is a perspective of what it is to be human and to have hope for the future even in the face of insurmountable adversity. It's funny, because I don't really think that any one particular thing stands out as spectacular. The performances are very good, but nothing really noteworthy. The characters all serve the story beautifully, but none of them really stand out from the others. Frank Darabont is great, the shots are exactly what they should be. Almost the entire film is shot at the prison, adding to the feeling of isolation and routine.And yet, we are captivated from the outset. Morgan Freeman could read a Sears catalogue and I'd pay to hear it, his narration breathes life into every scene that it's spoken over. The real beauty of this film is it's story, mostly about Andy and Red (Robbins and Freeman), but it's the way that each character contributes symbiotically to the development of the story that is the absolute mastery. Stephen King's novella ""Rita Hayworth and the Shawshank Redemption"" was the short story that was used as the basis for the film and it serves as evidence that King is not just a master of horror, but a true literary genius. Sure, he doesn't use as many fifty cent words as histories other great masters, but does anyone tell as good a story? King always gives his writing such distinct atmosphere and energy that you can't help but get swept away. The Shawshank Redemption is no different. If there is a film by which other films should be judged, this is as good as it can get. Powerful, engaging, visceral, despairing, a masterfully woven dialogue of what it means to be human. It's one of those journeys of the human spirit that just makes you feel happy to be alive.An amazing story translated beautifully to the screen. A masterpiece, 10/10."
"1459","The Shawshank Redemption",9,"An extraordinary and unforgettable film about a bank veep who is convicted of murders and sentenced to the toughest prison","Superbly played film set in 1946 , a bright young New England banker is convicted of the slayings of his spouse and her lover and sentenced to life at a strict State Prison . Introspective and quite Andy (Tim Robbins) gradually befriends inmates and over the next 2 decades wins the trust of prisoners and wardens but in his heart he still yearns for freedom . There he forms a peculiar friendship with Red (Morgan Freeman), the prison fixer , he experiences the brutality of prison life with a sadistic head guard (Clancy Brown), and is also mistreated and raped ; however , he adapts himself and offers financial advice to the guards and the selfish governor (Bob Gunton) , all in a shot 19 years. As two imprisoned men bond over a number of years, finding peace and redemption through acts of common help , friendship and decency . But when the proof of Andy's innocence is ripped away by those who need his services ,we learn that all is not quite what it seems at this State Penitentary , provoking a few susprises in the last two reels .
This is a very good and serious prison movie with thrills , emotion , exciting scenes , colour-blind relationships , hardnut camaraderie , gang opression , and violent disavowal of any homosexual implications . Prison buffs will find a lot of incidents to relish and the great spiritual resolution takes some swallowing and unexpected surprises . Adapted from the novella ¨Rita Hayworth and Shawshank redemption¨ ; the twist here is the upright starring is exceptionally bright , as his ability with accountancy leads to his handling the finances of everyone , from the humblest guard to the prison boss . Wonderful spectacle in watching time-passer while changing the bombshell actresses of the history : Rita Hayworth , Marilyn Monroe , Raquel Welch . US prison films have been making solid fares for more than sixty years and apart from slowness of pace in the second half , this one is well up to prison standards . This Frank Darabont's theatrical debut turns out to be a throwback rendition to the kind of literate , thought-provoking prison drama Hollywood used to make , such as : I am a fugitive from a chain gang , Birdman of Alcatraz and Escape from Alcatraz .Tim Robbins plays magnificently Andy , an inmate finding solace and eventual redemption , Tim provides his usual talent for playing ambiguous roles , as his notable skills are put to good use. Along with Robbins' best screen acting there are various Oscar-worthy supporting characters with special mention for Morgan Freeman as the good fixer who brings his ordinary grace to what could have been a thankless role , the veteran James Withmore as the crow-keeping librarian , the sympathetic newcomer inmate Gil Bellows ,William Sadler , Mark Rolston and the ruthless guardian Clancy Brown and , of course , the egoistic and nasty governor excellently played by Bob Gunton .It contains a colorful and evocative cinematography by Roger Deakins . And an enjoyable and really feeling musical score by Thomas Newman . In his engrossing direction debut ,Darabont avoids boring by fleeing most prison movie cliches . It results to be a pleasure of discovering a first-time filmmaker with evident respect for the intelligence of his audience , giving sensitive scenes , and brave enough to let roles details accumulate without recourse the excessively maudlin and over-sentimentality. It is a true masterpiece , being marvelously acted and perfectly paced."
"1460","The Shawshank Redemption",10,"Best movie of all time!","The first time I ever saw this movie I was just floored at how incredible it was. What wonderful casting that was done to help this amazing story be told. Stephen King has a way about creating such memorable characters. For those of you who think this movie is a ""prison movie"" you are sadly mistaken. This movie merely takes place in a prison but this story is about so much more...friendship, hope, survival and dreams! There is a reason this movie is voted #1 on the IMDb site! Not only have I enjoyed watching this movie over a hundred times but I have been lucky enough to have been in that prison numerous times doing paranormal events. My last visit out there was last weekend and I decided to also go and visit all of the filming locations! That was a real treat! All I can say is that if you have not seen this film just take the time to watch it and just take in the amazing story and the incredible performances turned in by the cast! I promise you that you won't be sorry!!!"
"1461","The Shawshank Redemption",8,"Freeman gives it depth","Andy Dufresne (Tim Robbins) is a banker convicted of murdering his wife and her lover. He always professes his innocence, but is thrown into Shawshank Prison with other lifers like Red (Morgan Freeman).Director Frank Darabont has made a prison fable out of a Stephen King short story. It is well acted by Tim Robbins and Morgan Freeman. Freeman is especially important as he is the narrator and the POV of the story. It's his lyrical voice that makes this fable compelling. It could have easily been a simple prison movie that rang hollow. Freeman gave the readings depth.If there is one complaint, it is Andy's claim of innocence. It needs to be shown early on during the trial. Instead, we derived mostly from Andy's demeanor. It needs to be a big declaration at the beginning. When Tommy (Gil Bellows) tells the story, he should include one detail from the trial like the 8 bullets. That way, the audience can get an aha moment. It's a minor point, and overall this is a good prison fable."
"1462","The Shawshank Redemption",10,"When There is Life, There is Hope; When There is Hope, There is Life","Like many of the reviewers, I hate prison movies with all the clichés and stereotypes of innocent prisoners, nasty guards, and evil wardens; and upon first viewing, many years ago, I especially disliked being forced by this film to feel sympathy and empathy with murderers, rapists and the like.Shawshank has somehow transcended the test of time; and I believe that it has endured, not because of the great performances (which don't seem to be acting at all, but real), not because of the simple, but multi-level, story line with its twists and turns, not because of its magnificent photography, not because of its score, and not because of any individual element that went into the making of this film. (Hence, the lack of academy awards.) However, when all those elements are combined, Shawshank becomes one of those masterpieces which is greater than the sum of its parts...and this film is so much greater that in the desperation of its characters, it invokes a multitude of good emotions in the viewer...that there is divine, poetic justice and hope in this hell of a world.Shawshank has become my favorite film of all time, but it took a while. ""When your're feeling down and out, watch Shawshank!"" Raising my vote from 8/10 to 10/10 (however subjective that vote may be.)"
"1463","The Shawshank Redemption",10,"The shortest long movie I've ever seen. Kept me wanting more and more, minute by minute.","At first, before starting the movie, I thought ""Sounds like a typical prison riot and break-out kind of movie"". At the beginning of the movie, my thoughts was even more convincing. A large prison (Which immediately reminded me of the movie ""The Last Castle"" from 2001), housing people of all sorts, having it's guards, warden and of course, the inmates. The typical inmate; Roughneck, hard on the outside, broken on the inside. And they all claim their innocence, as an internal joke sort of speak.It gets to a point where I started comparing it with others. That proved wrong in quite a short while, from the point where a prisoner, framed for murder of his wife and her lover, is being convicted and sentenced to life in prison. His name was Andy Dufresne. In short terms, a straight-up bank employee, excellent with numbers and taxes, which he also uses to benefit within the walls of the prison. His reputation as a numerological genius spreads out, and soon all kinds of people, inmates and guards, are coming to him for financial advice. He builds up a library, he maintains a strict surface. He has his hobbies, to keep his mind busy (as said in the movie). He carves chess pieces out of stone, using an axe as the tool. Seemingly, this is a nice and lucrative hobby, but underneath it all, he has a secret...The movie keeps the viewer thrilled and excited, because in every minute, something could happen. The dialog is good, Tim Robbins and Morgan Freeman, both great actors, shows and outstanding play. The crew really did good work on the set, the right camera angles, the light, sounds and so on...it was almost like I could smell the prison!A brilliant movie. Not too short, not too long. It's worth every minute watching! My highest recommendation for those who like drama, action and humor."
"1464","The Shawshank Redemption",NA,"Relentless Storytelling","I reviewed this film recently with a specific question in mind. At this writing, this film is ranked by IMDB viewers as the second best film ever made. The SECOND BEST EVER MADE!Why? This was my question.The acting is good. Robbins and Freeman are quality craftsmen in the Caine and Hackman tradition. But these are not truly great actors and in any case, they are only asked to play appealing persons, deliberately less-dimensional than real (as opposed to believably hyper-real which is much harder).The director is a first-timer, and it shows. There is simple framing and staging here. In fact, there seems to be a deliberate strategy to be as plain as possible. And that is the core of where I think people find the appeal of this film.The story is very tight in the sense of narrative flow. All the chunks are the same size, with no fancy rhythm. There is no distracting backstory. No element has irony, not writing, acting, shooting, even the score.Now for me, I expect and demand art in my films -- that's why I register this as plain. But I think it is well liked because it is totally without pretense. It is straight and honest; people seem hungry for honesty, and this has the appearance of what they need at just the right time.Is a film great because it merely fulfills? I hope many people think not, and dream that this film moves down the list to be replaced with more intelligent efforts."
"1465","The Shawshank Redemption",9,"A bit overrated, but still an amazing film","It's times like these that almost tempt me to grab Jigsaw off the shelf. It's been almost a month since I saw a film that was flatout bad; the worst review I've given in weeks was a 6/10 to Flightplan. This film obviously didn't break my streak.I went into it knowing next to nothing, only that IMDb has it ranked as the second best movie of all time, that it was based on a story by Stephen King, and that it took place in a prison. Needless to say, it blew me away. I wont say a thing about the plot, just so that others who've yet to see this film have a chance at the same experience as me. I will say this though: It has some of the most subtle and unexpected twists you will ever see. One in particular stands out above the rest.Not much can be said about the actors that hasn't been said. Morgan Freeman gives one of the best performances of his career, and even though I've only seen 2 or 3 other Tim Robbins movies, I'm sure the same can be said for him.Though I don't agree with the multitudes of people that call this the best movie ever made, it was still a very good, very well made, very entertaining and almost heartbreaking film.9/10"
"1466","The Shawshank Redemption",10,"The UNIVERSALITY of Shawshank:. Andy Dufresne as ""EVERYMAN""","........................................................from Pasto,Colombia...Via: L.A. CA., CALI, COLOMBIA and ORLANDO, FL If you have never seen SHAWSHANK, this review is aimed, primarily, at you. I suppose there must be some of you out there<U+0085>What is quite difficult to fathom is that anyone with any REAL interest in Cinema could have managed to avoid seeing it for the 20+ years since its release! In a Perfect World, SHAWSHANK is the movie of choice. What a serendipitous confluence of diverse and inspired elements! It is the exception that proves the Murphy's Law rule. Just look at the IMDb breakdown analysis of the vote<U+0085> In every area of human activity, there is always that ""2%""! SHAWSHANK is no exception. Precisely 2% of voters rated SHAWSHANK 1 Star! I invite you to check! In our culture there is a recurring undercurrent nightmare scenario of long-term wrongful imprisonment. Make that a Universal scenario, perhaps, in ALL cultures. Not a SPOILER here, because this point is clearly established in the opening 5 minutes. SHAWSHANK is the ultimate Black/White ""BRO-mance""<U+0085> Yet, uniquely, Morgan Freeman's character, ""Red"", is anything but the ""predestined to an untimely end"" sidekick<U+0085>The entire film is literally narrated from Red's perspective. If anything, Red's ""Main-Man"" prison status gives him a bit of a dominant role in their relationship. But the interaction of their characters is clearly that of 2 equals, gradually morphing into one of lifelong best BUDS! I can't help but wonder if, while cast and crew were in the midst of making SHAWSHANK, any of them imagined the magnitude of the cinematic milestone they were involved in! Box Office results are rather jaw- dropping, but in a negative sense: Opening WeekendA starkly paltry Position #144 among 1994 releases of just $750K U.S.! Overall 1994 Box Office, did not even make the Top 50! SHAWSHANK occupied a lackluster Spot #51, to be exact, with just over $28 Million taken in! My initial interest was piqued by a theatrical trailer, but I had to go by myself<U+0085>My wife, who is a rather avid movie goer, said<U+0085>""H-m-m-m-m, a prison drama?....What's the Title?"" After hearing it, she responded, ""The SHAW- What? No, Thanks<U+0085>I PASS!"" Well, needless to say, after a first viewing, my awe was complete and unmitigated, so I insisted on dragging her along just days later, for my second viewing. My wife became an instant SHAWSHANK believer. We both categorize this film in our lifetime top 5 favorites! Perhaps SHAWSHANK got off to such an inauspicious Box Office start for the same reasons that almost resulted in my wife not going to see it in 1994! I could literally write volumes on this movie, but, of course cannot here! A few more highlights: Interestingly, 7 Oscar Nominations, but ZER0 wins! Had the amazingly bad luck of having to compete with the mighty feel-good classic, FORREST GUMP, which steamrolled that year with 6 Oscars and #1 at the Box Office with $330 Million, about 12X SHAWSHANK's! Wonder what the Academy's members take on this would be today? Just look at the 7 categories where it was nominated<U+0085>Each one is exquisitely superb! Not a single Golden Statuette<U+0085>WOW! As far as Suspension of Disbelief is concerned, in the self-contained and totally insulated prison environment, it isn't much of a stretch to imagine an Old-Testament thumping warden anointing himself with almost god-like powers! Stranger things have happened, yes? In one odd twist, when one thinks of Illegal Immigration, Mexico, or Central America, to the USA invariably is the route that comes to mind<U+0085>not the opposite, right!?!?!? Despite having seen SHAWSHANK at least 15 times, it never ceases to mesmerize me. My only real critique: I think Andy would have to have been a magician to do what he did at the end, at least, so seamlessly<U+0085>Can't go into any more detail without treading into SPOILER territory, so you'll just have to figure it out for yourself! SHAWSHANK is truly a film for the ages! 10* STARS*<U+0085>....ENJOY/DISFRUTELA! Any comments, questions or observations, in English or Español, are most welcome!"
"1467","The Shawshank Redemption",10,"My own personal view","I don't care if there are some poor souls who would like to belittle this film. Just think of these misfits as beyond redemption.I saw this film in 1995 and still vividly felt the euphoria of the final half hour which stayed with me for a couple of weeks.I was convinced this was the best film I had ever seen in my life, even better than Akira Kurosawa's Ran and One flew over the cuckoo's nest, which was my all time favorite until TSR came along.I excitedly contacted my best friend who shared the same passion and he confirmed my thoughts,""this must be the best film I've ever seen!"" But it is sad though that I will probably never see a better film for the rest of my life as I have seen the best.In music I have heard the best in Rush and Jackson Browne which made others pale in comparison and in movies I have TSR.Hail Frank Darabont!"
"1468","The Shawshank Redemption",10,"I didn't think films could be this good....","The Shawshank Redemption came out in 1994 and was an absolute flop but found its real audience in home video, peaking as the most rented video of 1995 in the USA. A wonderful film that takes you into the prison experience of Red(Morgan Freeman) and Andy (Tim Robbins). Andy being a banker convicted of murder and Red a murderer already serving time, this movie takes you to the limits of human endurance, where the human spirit eventually prevails. The TSR takes you on an emotional journey that you will remember for a long time, thanks to the superb crafting of the film and sincere performances by the cast. The score is deep and haunting, this film is for the ages and will permenantly have a place in my heart. To me it is the best film of the 90's and quite possibly one of the best of all time.The fact that this film is sitting at No.2 is a testament to just how many people love this film, many viewers seem to have an emotional bond with the film, and I don't blame them. I only wish that I could view the film for the first time again, and experience that redeeming feeling Andy and Red experienced at the end.Ignore the hype surrounding the film and judge it on your own experience, the last half hour are especially beautiful. Watch this if you already haven't, and enjoy the masterpiece that Frank Darabont has so gracefully given us the privilege of viewing. 10/10"
"1469","The Shawshank Redemption",10,"For the first time the Movie defeats the Book!","As an omnivorous reader movies are always second to books to me. I believe....movie can never defeat the book because while reading book we use our own imagination....and movie narrows down the imagination.....it only allows us to see how the director has imagined the book.But Believe me...this is not the case of The Shawshank Redemption...which I rate as the best movie I have ever seen.For the first time in history the book(the Stephen King Novella) has been defeated by its movie version.After watching the movie I was crazy about reading the book....I thought wow!the movie is so good...how will be the book!!To tell U frankly,the book is good, but the movie is best.There are some unforgettable scenes in the movie which were not in the book.Some examples are: The scene when Andy locks up the guard and play the opera on the microphone.The narration goes on like..""I didn't understand a single word that Italian lady was singing...but I tell U..for that single second every soul in the Shawshank prison felt free...""The scene just fill my heart with Andy's yearn for freedom...I was kinda shocked when I didn't find it in the original book version.I can remember another scene.While Andy creates the prison library and starts listing books sent to prison from charity organizations...a fellow inmate tries to read a name on the book...Alexandre Dumas as ""Dumb-Ass"". Andy says....""its not Dumb-ass...its Dumas..and U may like the book..The Count of Monty Cristo...its about a jailbreak.And the category it falls is Fiction"" Then Red says..""Why don't we put it on Educational category?""(Right before Andy listed an engineering handbook as ""Educational"" category).As Count of Monticristo is one of my favorite books, I was hysteric watching this sophisticated joke.This was also not in the book.This DVD is my favorite gift I give my friends. And after they watch it....they always thank me . Like many other IMDb friends commenting on this movie..I would also like to say..""Shawshank Redemption is the best movie I have ever seen in my life"".Thanx to all."
"1470","The Shawshank Redemption",10,"One of the best movies I have ever seen","This movie is one of the best I have ever seen. I first read the book, and I didn't liked it that much, but then I saw the movie. And that's a things that's never happened to me before, the movie was better than the book. It's the other way normally. But in this case, the movie is so much better, I like the end more than in the book. Watch the movie, it is great."
"1471","The Shawshank Redemption",NA,"A movie about an innocent clever man who learns to live within prison walls.","This is Tim Robbins best performance ever. It is a compelling heart warming drama about an innocent man(Andy Dufresbe) who is sent to prison and learns to use his intelligence to make the best of prison life. He meets a mentor in Red(Morgan Freeman) and they build a friendship that is stronger than the walls that surround them. Andy steadies a relationship with the warden that keeps him in the good eyes of the prison. Andy is full of surprises and uses his resourcefulness to not only win the friendships of his fellow prisoners, but also of the prison guards. Both Andy and Red both hold on to their dream of one day enjoying their freedom. They turn their friendship and dreams of freedom into a bond that no prison could ever take away."
"1472","The Shawshank Redemption",10,"One of the best movies ever made?","Probably yes, acting was good, plot brilliant, I mean Stephen King wrote the book, but it can't match the film. When I sow this movie I thought ""thats it, this is it, best movie ever"". Sure you can find people who didn't like it, and when I ask ""why"", and try to guess what then happened? They just confused themselves, they can say reason why they don't like this movie... When I try to read comments with 1/10 star, I can't find comment with good reasons that could make me realize, that this movie is a bad movie, If there is no reason, then this means, that its the best movie ever made!The only reason people are giving 1 star is that they don't like ratio ""9,2"", they want to do more effect by pull this high ratio down, I really hate them :) Sorry for my bad English language, I live in EUrope, my English teacher is big cow with no knowledge..."
"1473","The Shawshank Redemption",7,"Good movie, but best of all time? Hardly . . .","I was a little surprised at first to see this film ranked #1 out of all possible candidates in the IMDB user ratings. When I thought about it, though, it made more sense--this is a ""Rocky""-type feel-good movie that doesn't really make you think and reinforces what we would all like to believe about human nature. Don't get me wrong--it's a fine film (I gave it a solid 7 out of 10), it's just not, in my view, up there with _Casablanca_ and _The Graduate_.I guess the main problem I have with _Shawshank_ is the nature of the script and characters. Think about it: is there a single person in the film who isn't a one-dimensional cardboard cut-out with very simple motivations, or a Hollywood cliche or stereotype? We have (in no particular order), a corrupt, bigoted prison warden (who is a religious hypocrite for good measure), a brutal prison guard, a man who is wrongly accused of murder, an old convict who knows all the ropes and can't live on the outside, and a convict who is murdered by the brutal guards. Now where have we seen this stuff before? Only in a few dozen movies made from the 20s to the 90s. There's really nothing new here. Probably this comes from the fact that the story is from Stephen King, who doesn't really do well with complex characters (a problem I noted as far back as _Carrie_).If you want to see a good prison picture, try _Cool Hand Luke_ (from which this movie borrows considerably). If you want an escape picture, see either _The Great Escape_ or _Papillon_, both with Steve McQueen. Or if, by some chance, you want a crime and punishment movie that really makes you think, go with the late great Stanley Kubrick's _A Clockwork Orange_.I couldn't stop thinking about the warden: doesn't he have a family? How did they feel? What are they going to do now? I realize the story is inside the prison, but I wish the movie had made better use of its characters than simply as simple-minded symbols of EVIL or VIRTUE.I'm not Mr. Cranky, I did enjoy the movie, but I enjoyed it the same way I do an Italian dinner at the Olive Garden--a well-constructed genre product with nothing special to commend it."
"1474","The Shawshank Redemption",7,"Mystery","I still can't quite get the enormous reputation of this film. I saw it again last night and instead of clearing up the mystery, the mystery got thicker. It is enjoyable film with very good performances by Tim Robbins, Morgan Freeman, James Whitmore etc, but...the most highly rated film ever? I don't get it. The voice over alone seems to belong to a so so film. I love Morgan Freeman's voice but he's telling us what we're seeing. So, the sterling reputation damages the enjoyment of the film because one is expecting something that never, really, arrives. The most interesting aspect is Tim Robbins's psychological journey. Credible or incredible doesn't quite matter, I did go with him without asking too many questions. Morgan Freeman's humanity is contagious and inspiring, whether credible or not because I bought it. So, a masterpiece? No. Good, even very good? Yes."
"1475","The Shawshank Redemption",10,"What a movie!!!","I totally adored the concept of hope in this film. I love how the director portrays the Shawshank tyrants as corrupt murderers, that's pretty much what they are and serve as the grounds for the escape of Andy. Now Morgan Freeman's got talent, I love that guy he may not be the greatest out there but he is a force to be reckoned with on the set. I loved how he gave the story flavor with his descriptions of characters and perceptions of how life was in lonely jail cells of Shawshank. You know there's a lot more to say about this movie, it's too good too be true. Especially the ending which by the way brought tears to eyes, the most moving scene!!! Overall it was superb and all thanks to Stephen King for putting this in the form of alphabets in the first place. I'm starting to regret not reading any of his novels. And kudos to the director for even coming up with such an idea for a movie."
"1476","The Shawshank Redemption",10,"One of the greatest movies of all time","The first time I saw ""The Shawshank Redemption"" I was only 12. At the time I was amazed at how a movie could present so much emotion. As I have grown, my taste in movies has also. Still, I rank ""Shawshank"" as my favorite film, the one that I could watch every day for the rest of my life. If you have not seen this film, I pity you. Do not just rent it at your local Blockbuster. I implore you step away from your computer, go out to the nearest store, and buy this movie. Not only do Morgan Freeman and Tim Robbins give performances that will make you question your humanity, but you will most definitely learn something that will benefit you as a person. So, if you are yet to see this film, you must (in the words of Andy), ""Get busy livin', or get busy dyin'."""
"1477","The Shawshank Redemption",10,"one of my absolute favorites!","This is definitely one of my favorite movies -- it makes me cry and laugh and ache inside all at once.  Tim Robbins, you make my days a little brighter -- thank you!"
"1478","The Shawshank Redemption",10,"The greatest movie ever made and to be made","The Shawshank Redemption is a story of life itself. It is not about a person in prison, it is about the soul and the battle it accepts and carries on to deserve the life it has been given by God. I watched the movie for the first time some months ago. That evening I was about to go out with some friends but out meeting was canceled and I had to stay home. Being unhappy about that, I started watching the movie on the TV just by chance, not knowing about its existence before that at all. At first I was skeptic, I admit that. But oh God, at the end of it I was screaming and jumping in my room at 1 AM! It gave me so much emotions and so much hope, I had never felt before that. I could hardly believe that a movie could make me feel that way - so excited, so happy about my life, leaving me believing so much in my own self. It is a great story of what the strength of your thoughts can make you do. In The Shawshank Redemption desire does not make you weak, just the opposite - gives you wings to fly away from fear, fly closer and closer to freedom. Morgan Freeman's voice is just another advantage that makes the movie even more impressive. Tim Robbins' act is just beyond perfection! I bought the DVD this summer and every time I feel weak or just bad about something, I watch the movie. It has become my personal shrink, making me feel strong enough anytime I watch it. Can never imagine a better movie made anywhere in the world even after 1000 years!"
"1479","The Shawshank Redemption",10,"An astonishing tale of endurance, courage, life, and perspective..","At the time of writing this comment, IMDb ranks the Shawshank Redemption as No. 2 in top 250 best movies of all time. Let me tell you that this is no exaggeration and no small feat given IMDb's strict rating criteria. Shawshank is indeed, up there amongst the best, and if you haven't seen it yet, you should make it a point to watch it, at least once sometime in your life. For it is an astonishing tale, of endurance, courage, life, and perspective, combined with a stunning score that flows so closely with the highs and lows of emotion that it could make grown men cry. No words can explain how good Shawshank really is, but let the sheer volume of good user reviews made by devotees in this website be proof enough of its greatness."
"1480","The Shawshank Redemption",10,"Best of all time!!!","This is the best movie I have ever seen. In a way I feel I am in a prison of life myself. Restricted to doing certain things. Sometimes I get frustrated and feel as I should runaway to some place where I could feel free. I hope and dream for it sometime. This movie just reminds me of my feelings so much. I love Andy Dufresne most in this movie. Although critics say Tim Robbins didn't do enough to express the character but my personal opinion is that he was made for this role.I can go on and say more but I said the most important thing which I feel whenever I watch it.I am glad to visit IMDb. I never heard of it before. Some 7 years ago I saw it at no.2 in the rankings and decided to watch it immediately. Only other movie which even comes close to this is Citizen Kane. But that is about past and this one is about hope and freedom.I give it 11/10."
"1481","The Shawshank Redemption",10,"A melodramatic, motherf***ing masterpiece","In this review I'm not going to give a plot synopsis of this film because I'm sure everybody else who has commented on it has. However, I will express the positive effect it can have on the viewer if they let it.The acting is uncommonly magnificent. Morgan Freeman delivers the greatest performance of his brilliant career as the seasoned life-serving prisoner Ellis Boyd ""Red"" Redding, Tim Robbins holds his own against Freeman as Andy, the central character, James Whitmore's portrayal of the institutionalized Brooks provides the backbone of the story, Bob Gunton is wonderful as the corrupt Warden Norton, and Clancy Brown's commanding performance as Captain Hadley, the sadistic head prison guard, almost makes him steal the show from Freeman.Frank Darabont's restrained direction of the delicate story is critical for the film to not become sentimental or clichéd, and his beautiful adaptation of the Stephen King story on which the movie is based is a real breath of fresh air. On account of Darabont, the film shows that special effects are not needed to tell a great story in film. As a 17-year-old male, I love special effects movies as much as the next person, but they get boring after a while. Plus many people forget that there was a time in cinema when the blockbuster didn't exist, when they made movies that just told great stories and gave the audience a chance to be uplifted by those stories without the creators having to resort to special effects. I applaud you for having the guts to make a non-commercial film that reminds people of that in this day and age, Mr. Darabont.SPOILER ALERT! As with all truly great films, 'The Shawshank Redemption' is full of scenes that have become entrenched in the public's collective consciousness. There's the scene where Andy plays the opera record over the loudspeaker for all the inmates in the prison, Captain Hadley bashing ""Fat @$$"" to death for crying during his first night in prison (a very powerful scene), Red giving his ""Rehabilitated?"" speech to the board of parole officials, the Warden getting his final judgement, and of course, Andy crawling to freedom through what Red in his narration calls ""500 yards of s**t-smelling foulness I can't even imagine,"", the scene which for me is perhaps the greatest movie scene of the '90s.END OF SPOILERS! I thoroughly recommend this cinematic masterpiece, which has earned its place in my humble top ten films of all time list, to anybody. Whatever gender, age, religion, nationality etc. you are and whatever language you speak, I guarantee it will change your life, or perhaps even save it. Movies like 'The Shawshank Redemption' only come along once every decade, if that. Unforgettable.10/10."
"1482","The Shawshank Redemption",10,"Better Late Then Never","Along with Q and Pulp Fiction, Frank Darabont (The Walking Dead original writer) and his debut film got screwed by the Hollywood Powerhouse that is Tom Hanks with this now can be considered an American Classic. The fact that this film barely and I emphasize barely made it's money back in US theaters (which is usually a signal for a film to turn into a DOA when released at home) and it made such a splash, that the film is exceeding what anyone thought a simple 18 years ago. This includes some of Hollywood's best critics including EW's Owen Gleiberman who originally gave the film a B- back in late '94. Yet over time, this story of redemption, like the rise of hope this film gives from beginning to end, grows on you to the point where at the very end, you have no choice but to clap (I clapped in my basement in front of my parents and I haven't looked the same since). Darabont found a formula that worked and it shows in his future films. He made Robbins human, made Morgan Freeman's voice as American as a Big Mac and made the late great Rita Hayworth relevant again. The only regret that one should have is the fact that if it was released two years later it would've swept away the Oscars (Sorry Ralph Fiennes, The English Patient won on a weak year.)"
"1483","The Shawshank Redemption",10,"This is one of the most inspiring n one of the greatest film.","The Shawshank Redemption is undoubtedly deserves to be the highest rated movie.

Written & directed by Frank Darabont, this prison drama is a simple but profoundly moving tale of hope, friendship & redemption. Cinematography exquisitely captures the monotonous daily life inside prison. The bond that grows between the two main characters is unforgettable and the score is the best I have heard. Morgan Freeman makes us feel the sadness and Tim Robbins, the faith. The more times you watch it, the more you love it, and the more you learn from it. Whatever you do, don't listen to the people who say this movie is overrated because this is one of the most inspiring and greatest film. It has everything you could possibly want in a movie. If you don't love Shawshank, chances are you are beyond redemption. It is hard to find a more proper word for the film than a masterpiece. It's in my top five movies of all time. I feel so bad about not writing a review of this masterpiece during the late nineties."
"1484","The Shawshank Redemption",10,"The greatest movie ever made..!","The greatest movie ever made..! Period. Pure and simple, it is what every director hope to achieve. The film will keep you glued to your seat if you know what it means.It will bring tears to your eyes. It will make you think how you have lived your life so far...or in fact how you have wasted it. It will teach you the value of freedom which we enjoy without giving a second thought. And it will leave you with a sense of happiness which you will experience only rarely. The performances are simply mind boggling, be it Tim Robbins or Morgan Freeman or countless others. And it is difficult to believe this was the debut of Frank Darabont as a director.If you haven't already seen it... please do, otherwise you are missing something."
"1485","The Shawshank Redemption",10,"Simply Perfect","Like I did a few years back, you might be hesitating about watching this film. The title didn't appeal to me, and neither did the subject matter, so it was only by chance that I started to watch it.I can only say that the film was a revelation for me and has stayed with me ever since. There are so many dark and hopeless films out there which, whilst they leave an impression, leave the wrong one i.e that there is no hope in life. Watch this film and be uplifted and be encouraged by the message...that there is ALWAYS hope....in any situation.Please watch this film and the watch it again. It's a great answer to all the cynicism that is out there."
"1486","The Shawshank Redemption",10,"NOT just a prison movie","A film about a Stephen King story? Directed by Frank Darabont.  .  .  Who?  Starring Tim Robbins.  .  .  Wasn't he the guy from Howard the Duck?  I admit, only the sublime acting talents of Morgan Freeman took me along to see this movie.  Now the only questions I have to ask are:  Why didn't EVERYBODY go to see this movie?  and, Why didn't Morgan Freeman win the Oscar?  Tom Hanks is a fine actor but, he should never have beaten Morgan.  Once again a Stephen King short story translates to film better than his horror opus'.  Tim Robbins pulls out his finest performance to date, and, Mr Darabont take a bow.  Very rarely are you left with a large smile and warm heart at the end of a movie but, I could have danced as the camera slowly panned back from the beach.  .  .  Perfect."
"1487","The Shawshank Redemption",10,"Well Worth A Read.","I enjoyed reading Stephen King's short story ""Rita Hayworth And Shawshank Redemption"" from the book ""Different Seasons"" more than watching the movie. However, it's still one of my favourite movies of all time.It has very few peers, and has to be seen. It is Awesome."
"1488","The Shawshank Redemption",7,"Over Rated","There is no denying that this is a very good movie. The acting is great and it tells a good story. Personally, I find it a bit too long and a little too sweet for my taste, but its far from a bad film. On the other end of the spectrum I have yet to understand why this film was nominated for as many Oscars as it was and why so many people have fallen in love with it. To place it on the same level as The Godfather and several hundred other films has to be the result of different tastes.
This is a film that should be seen because its a good movie, not because its a great one."
"1489","The Shawshank Redemption",8,"The writing was there","I really loved this movie I watch 2 time actually but it was too long"
"1490","The Shawshank Redemption",10,"Masterpiece","One of the epic and remembered movie of all the time.

It was smart, clever, and brings you inside behind the wall. The actors are brilliant, the writing was awesome! I highly recommend you see this movie!"
"1492","The Shawshank Redemption",10,"It was best in my life","So i watched this film maybe 10 times Russian version, 5 original English. Read both book versions. It's beautiful story! When i have watched this film first time, after started to follow the career of the actor Morgan Freeman. He is a great actor. I give the film 10 stars"
"1493","The Shawshank Redemption",10,"Fantastic movie","I have never seen such an amazing film since I saw The Shawshank Redemption. Shawshank encompasses friendships, hardships, hopes, and dreams. And what is so great about the movie is that it moves you, it gives you hope. Even though the circumstances between the characters and the viewers are quite different, you don't feel that far removed from what the characters are going through.It is a simple film, yet it has an everlasting message. Frank Darabont didn't need to put any kind of outlandish special effects to get us to love this film, the narration and the acting does that for him. Why this movie didn't win all seven Oscars is beyond me, but don't let that sway you to not see this film, let its ranking on the IMDb's top 250 list sway you, let your friends recommendation about the movie sway you.Set aside a little over two hours tonight and rent this movie. You will finally understand what everyone is talking about and you will understand why this is my all time favorite movie."
"1494","The Shawshank Redemption",10,"A gritty look at prison. One of the best prison movies ever.","This movie I'm not going to call this film the IMDb #1 movie, but I really can't deny that this is fantastic. The cast, the score, the writing, and the power are all here in this film, and filled with strength. It's one of those movies that you will continue to think about even after the film is over. It is about a friendship, a life, an evil, and a hope. A hope that is considered in many ways to be bridge to insanity inside the prison walls. We see these people as years of time goes by. We see friendships grow, and topics change. It really puts you in the prison, and makes you feel what's like to behind those bars. You feel the friendship, the hope, the darkness, and the pure horror of it all.4 stars out of 4"
"1495","The Shawshank Redemption",NA,"Hope is a Good Thing. Maybe the Best of Things. And No Good Thing Ever Dies.","Out of the three genre-defining classics released in 1994, The Shawshank Redemption was the one that ended up bearing the maximum brunt. First commercially by failing to recover its budget for it debuted in theatres together with one of cinema's greatest watershed events; Pulp Fiction. And then at Academy Awards where it was nominated for seven Oscars yet failed to win any, thanks to the sweeping show by the critics' darling, Forrest Gump.But life ever since has been very kind to this film, and both critics & viewers have embraced its uplifting story of hope & friendship with remarkable amount of respect, love & kindness. Today, The Shawshank Redemption enjoys a position that's arguably even higher than the two classics which eclipsed it back in 1994 and while it was discarded at its time of release, it is now rightly & universally acknowledged as one of the greatest films of all time.The Shawshank Redemption tells the story of Andy Dufresne, a successful banker, who is wrongfully convicted of murdering his wife & her illicit lover and is ultimately sentenced to two consecutive life terms in prison where his coping with the brutal hardships of confined life slowly earns him the respect of his fellow inmates & prison staff, including that of ""Red"" in whom Andy finds a trusted ally. The remainder of the film explores their friendship over the next two decades.Written & directed by Frank Darabont, this prison drama is a simple but profoundly moving tale of hope, friendship & redemption that'll manage to connect deeply with most of us in one way or another plus it also marks Darabont's directional debut and he couldn't have asked for a better start. All this film has is men in either prison or police uniforms talking to one another over the course of its runtime and yet it never looked dull or felt like dragging at any given moment.Cinematography exquisitely captures the monotonous daily life inside prison and provides considerable depth & realism to the era this film is set in. Every moment of despair has a shadowy appearance while moments of hope gleam with light. Editing is spectacular too as the gradual progression of Andy's life, his friendship with Red, and his determination to not give in to the four walls containing him is effectively unfolded. And Thomas Newman's score beautifully blends with the film's tone & characters' lives, and is emotionally fulfilling.Coming to the performances, Tim Robbins delivers a swashbuckling performance as Andy Dufresne, the banker wrongfully convicted for the crime he didn't commit. And if Robbins is at his best, then Morgan Freeman is even better as Red, Andy's friend who is also serving a life sentence & is notorious amongst the inmates for he can smuggle goods into the prison. Freeman also narrates the story to us at which he does an even better job. His work is grounded & can go easily unnoticed, but the character of Red is the soul of this story.There is a reason why this film still connects with so many people & why many of them have latched on to it. There is a reason why even after two decades, its legacy keeps flourishing & viewers keep returning to it despite its low entertainment value. One major reason is that even though The Shawshank Redemption is a prison drama, its story of imprisonment goes far beyond the bricks & steel rods of a jailhouse. The entire picture is a reflection of our own imprisonment in the institutions of our daily lives; institutions like work, family, society etc & living up to the expectations of each one of them.On an overall scale, The Shawshank Redemption stresses that based on the outlook of life, there are only two types of people: one who can be free even in prison while others who find themselves imprisoned even in freedom. The message it is trying to resonate is clear: Fear can hold you prisoner, Hope can set you free. And if we all give ourselves some hope, there is nothing we can't survive. Yes, it all seems preachy n everything, but then if there's ever been a motion picture that has earned this sort of right, it's The Shawshank Redemption. Strongly recommended."
"1496","The Shawshank Redemption",10,"This should be in everyone's permanent collection.","I haven't seen too many movies that I would rate a 10, but I had no problems giving this one top score.Movie-making seems to be like golf; for a truly excellent game, ALL the elements must come together. Everyone involved must have perfect ""form"". Director, Darabont, must have been at the top of his game when he put this gem together. Of course the actors were excellent; Morgan Freeman and Tim Robbins seldom disappoint. The thing that makes this movie exceptional is that Darabont coaxed the best performances out of the supporting actors also. Bob Gunton and Clancy Brown were utterly believable (and bad guys don't come much worse than them).The other essential ingredient for a successful movie is simple: It must have a well thought out plot with a perfect beginning, middle and end. So many movies fall over by getting at least one of these aspects wrong. Not so with Shawshank Redemption. Just like Goldilocks said, ""This is just right!"" Buy this one for your home collection because you'll definitely want to see it again."
"1497","The Shawshank Redemption",9,"A Sort of Secular Redemption","The story of this film takes place over a twenty-year period between 1947 and 1967. Andy Dufresne, a young banker from Portland, Maine, is wrongly convicted of murdering his wife and her lover, and sentenced to life imprisonment. (""Shawshank"" is the name of the prison where he serves his sentence). The prison is a brutal place, and Andy is frequently beaten and sexually assaulted by a gang of homosexual inmates called ""The Sisters"". Two things, however, help him to survive. One is his friendship with another convict, Red, who has a reputation for being able to acquire almost any item and, for a price, to smuggle it into the prison. The other is his financial expertise, which he puts to good use, becoming a tax and financial adviser to the prison guards and even the Warden himself. As a reward for these services, Andy is given a privileged job in the prison library and protection from molestation. To avenge their attacks on Andy, the leader of the ""Sisters"" is so badly beaten by the guards that he is crippled for life; Andy is not molested again.The Warden devises a scheme under which inmates are put to work on local construction projects. The purpose of this is ostensibly to prepare them for life after they are released, but in reality he is exploiting their free labour for his own personal profit, and using Andy's financial skills to launder the proceeds. This arrangement seems to work to Andy's advantage, because of the extra privileges he is granted, but things change when a new young prisoner named Tommy Williams is sent to Shawshank. Tommy has evidence that could secure Andy's release; a former cellmate in another prison has confessed to him that he committed the murders for which Andy was convicted. Tommy confides this secret to the Warden who, fearing that his illegal schemes will be revealed should Andy ever be released, arranges to have Tommy murdered by a corrupt guard.There is a long history of American prison films, including the likes of ""I am a Fugitive from a Chain Gang"", ""Cool Hand Luke"", ""Brubaker"" and the more recent ""The Last Castle"". (Frank Darabont was later to direct another prison film, ""The Green Mile"", based, like ""The Shawshank Redemption"" on a Stephen King story). Most of these were made with a liberal social agenda in mind, aiming to expose the harsh prison conditions and thereby inspire their reform. ""The Shawshank Redemption"" falls, to some extent, within this tradition; it is made from a basically liberal viewpoint and vividly depicts the brutality of prison life, although the fact that it is a period piece, set several decades in the past, might suggest that social issues were not the filmmakers' sole concern. Perhaps more important are the analysis of the nature of freedom and of the relationship between Andy and Red.The word ""prison"", from the French ""pris"" (""taken""), merely indicates a place where captives are held, and the authorities, especially in America, prefer to describe many prisons by some more positive term such as ""penitentiary"" or ""reformatory"" which implies their purpose of rehabilitating criminals. Shawshank, a prison where the Warden and guards are at least as crooked as the inmates, has precisely the opposite effect. Andy goes in innocent of any crime and comes out guilty of being an accessory to corruption and fraud. Yet, despite his involvement in the Warden's dishonesty, Andy retains a certain integrity; he refuses to give up hope and refuses to allow himself to be beaten by the system. Although he is in prison he has found a sort of freedom. A key moment comes when he defies the guards to play a Mozart aria over the prison loudspeakers for all the inmates to hear- a reminder of spiritual values even in the harshest of environments.Red faces a different problem. He fears that he has become so institutionalised that he will be unable to survive freedom, as happened to another long-term prisoner who committed suicide shortly after his release. In prison, his role as the ""fixer"" who can obtain anything, be it a packet of cigarettes, a rock hammer or a poster of Rita Hayworth, makes him the king of the inmates. (These latter two items will play an important role in the plot). On the outside he will be just another ex-con trying to make ends meet in a dead-end job. Paradoxically, he is more free in jail than he will be on the outside. I won't give away the ending, but it involves Andy repaying Red's previous kindnesses by showing him how he can be free in all senses of the word.The film was not a great box office success when first released but has since acquired a status as one of the classics of the modern American cinema; it has now supplanted ""The Godfather"" as number one on IMDb's Top 250 list. The film would perhaps not be number one on my personal list, but it is a fine one and would certainly be in my top 250, perhaps the top 100. Its two stars, Tim Robbins as Andy and Morgan Freeman as Red, are both excellent. Its initial lack of success may have had something to do with its rather clumsy title. ""Shawshank"" is not a word that will mean anything to the average person (according to one story Darabont was once asked how his ""rickshaw"" film was going) and ""redemption"", except in technical legal contexts, normally has a religious connotation. This is not an explicitly religious film; indeed, in its portrayal of Warden Norton as a sanctimonious, Bible-bashing hypocrite, it can be seen as critical of religion. Nevertheless, the word ""redemption"" is perhaps appropriate in this context, after undergoing the hell of Shawshank Andy and Red manage to find a sort of secular redemption. It may be this message of hope that accounts for the film's continuing popularity. 9/10"
"1498","The Shawshank Redemption",10,"The best movie ever!","Even though this movie is over 10 years old, the message about friendship and not ever giving up will be relevant forever. The lessons that the main characters teach us in the face of adversity are timeless. This is also one movie that does not get old, and I have watched ""Shawshank"" many times. Tim Robbins and Morgan Freeman were spectacular in their performances. They teach lessons that are extremely memorable and have quotes that you will never forget. The one quote in the film that is a stand-out is, ""Get busy living, or get busy dying"". Who would not feel the impact of that quote? This is one movie you have to have in your library, and I am not one that usually buys DVD's. This is a MUST SEE!!!! Don't miss this one, and also keep a box of tissues nearby."
"1499","The Shawshank Redemption",10,"Greatest Movie of All time, hands down!","The Shawshank Redemption is the BEST movie of all time for many reasons. The first reason being that Morgan Freeman did his best acting job, and that is saying something. Freeman is the greatest actor of all time. Secondly, Tim Robbins gets so into his part you feel like the story is totally true and you are actually seeing it first hand. The supporting actors are wonderful as well. Enough about the acting which was second to none but the story was so compelling. The audience feels sympathy for the main character and wishes for him to be redeemed, in the end its just a feel good story. I cannot express this enough, GO WATCH THE MOVIE NOW! It is awesome and will never be topped."

"1501","The Shawshank Redemption",NA,"I may be in the minority here but.......","I have literally just turned off the DVD player after watching this film for the very first (and last) time after so much hype I thought it was about time. I sat all the way through it and did enjoy it, but I really don't see what all the fuss is about. Yes it is a good film, yes it is a good plot. However I had guessed the outcome and a few bits within the film before the flashback at the end, and therefore for me there were no unexpected twists. I wasn't even moved at the end. In fact all in all I was a bit disappointed, as my friends who have seen it said that they had cried and it was such a brilliant film. Am I abnormal???????? I think the green mile was better and I did cry at the end of that. I'm sorry if I upset any of you who think it is the best film ever, but I don't."
"1502","The Shawshank Redemption",7,"#1 ? SERIOUSLY ??","This is a normal average movie . People are just hyped because it is in #1 . And I don't think those people have seen a lot of movies . It's way too much overrated in my opinion . My honest rating would be 7/10"
"1503","The Shawshank Redemption",10,"IMDb and the Greatest Film of All Time","Two imprisoned men (Tim Robbins and Morgan Freeman) bond over a number of years, finding solace and eventual redemption through acts of common decency.Is this the greatest film of all time? IMDb would have you believe so. Despite being a box office flop (that barely recouped its budget), the film received multiple award nominations and outstanding reviews from critics for its acting, story, and realism. It has since been successful on cable television, VHS, DVD, and Blu-ray.And it deserves this praise that seems to be growing each year. Now twenty years old, the film has not aged a day, and instead seems to be getting better. This is Tim Robbins' best role, and a fine performance from the always wonderful Morgan Freeman."
"1504","The Shawshank Redemption",10,"Richly human, uplifting","Deservedly ranked at the top of IMDb's all-time best 250 films ever.The casting is superb: Morgan Freeman is ""Red,"" a wise observer of people and an entrepreneur inmate who's made ""connections"" so he can get contraband to other inmates for a price; he's under a life sentence for murder. Tim Robbins is ""Andy,"" a smart banker and accounting whiz who was sentenced to 2 life terms for killing his wife and her lover (which he--like most other inmates, say they're not guilty of). And Bob Gunton is ""Warden Norton"" who, when we first meet him, is touting the virtues of Bible reading and strict discipline. While, fortunately, I've had no first hand experience, ""Shawshank"" certainly gives the feel of authenticity of prison life and its society.A long movie, most of it takes place inside a semi-corrupt state penitentiary in the late 1940s. ""Red,"" in talking his thoughts out loud to himself, becomes our narrator for many developments. As the story unfolds, increasingly we come to see Andy as a person with strong personal values which he upholds in the most difficult situations. And in Andy's work for Warden Norton, we also increasingly find the warden as morally his opposite: selfish and fundamentally lacking decent moral character--all show and appearance and with no integrity, substance.In Roger Ebert's first review (of his two) of this movie, he said: ""....the film is an allegory about holding onto a sense of personal worth, despite everything....the word redemption is in the title for a reason...."" Most viewers will agree."
"1505","The Shawshank Redemption",10,"A favourite film","When i watched this film i thought now whats this going to be like? After watching it i thought it was a brilliant film,fantastically acted with greats like Morgan Freeman and Tim Robbins and Bob Gunton. Very realistic and definitely one of my absolute favourites of all time. At the end it made me cry and thought about life. Every time i watch it the film brings a tear to my eye. Fantastic film and worth watching,it's really realistic film and another one of stephen king's great stories, a story of hope and many people who have watched will say the same thing - if you haven't seen this film already then watch it, it is brilliant, just brilliant!!be prepared to be moved, it's such a breathtaking journey for the whole two hours. A truly lovely magical film, my favourite of all time fantastic"
"1506","The Shawshank Redemption",10,"What a beautiful movie!","All is perfect : the complexity of the characters, the suspense, the principals themes like friendship, loneliness, injustice, redemption, vengeance, freedom... The most complete movie that i've ever seen. Tim Robbins is great, sensitive, brilliant: in one scene, he can feel a thousand of feelings. Freeman is very correct and seems to be really ""Red"". Gunton, Sadler and all the others seemed to have fun playing in this master of peace. Titanic is pure entertainment and received 11 oscars. This movie deserves 30 oscars because it shows what is really important in life. No action, more realistic, more useful than the other films. It was really a BIG BANG in my head the first time i saw it. When i see it again, I think and I realize the incredible power that the cinema's industry have. In a different way, only Star Wars, Saving Private Ryan and some others have the same impact."
"1507","The Shawshank Redemption",NA,"Very Cool!!!","Since I bought (a lot of years ago) a videotape with two Stephen King's short films, one of them ""The Woman In The Room"", directed by Frank Darabont, I had the strange sensation that this guy could very well become one of the good directors in the filming industry... and here we are, with another King's story he managed to do one of the best films in this decade (90's), of course, with the help of nonetheless but mr. Freeman and mr. Robbins, who could have spoiled it?"
"1508","The Shawshank Redemption",9,"Stands the test of time","This film will go down in history as one of the greats!!!"
"1509","The Shawshank Redemption",9,"""I Had To Go To Prison To Learn To Be A Crook""","None of the usual otherworld creatures that populate the works of Stephen King are to be found in The Shawshank Redemption. But the real world of that Maine prison has some bizarre rules of its own and there's a whole new reality within those walls.In the tradition of Cool Hand Luke and Birdman Of Alcatraz comes Tim Robbins who was a banker on the outside, but when he caught his wife cheating on him with a golf pro from their country club, he's convicted of putting eight bullets in them, four apiece and tried and sentenced to two consecutive life terms in Shawshank prison. Like Luke and Bob Stroud he works out his own rehabilitation and rebels against the prison system.He may be a con, but Robbins still has all his knowledge of finances and pretty soon he's made himself quite invaluable to the warden and the rest of the staff at the prison. At the same time he and the cell block scrounger Morgan Freeman develop a close personal relationship. In the end they beat the system in a most unique way.There have been some classic prison films made ever since The Big House at the dawn of the talkies. Two I've already mentioned. My favorite prison film is Robert Redford's Brubaker, but The Shawshank Redemption comes pretty close. As does The Green Mile which was also directed by Frank Darabont.Darabont got an Oscar nomination as did the film itself and as did Morgan Freeman for Best Actor. The Shawshank Redemption was in for a flock more Oscar nominations in 1994. A couple other good performances are that of James Whitmore the institutionalized con who is there for 50 years and paroled and just can't make it on the outside. He will break your heart as will Gil Bellows who plays a fresh, but rather likable young con who runs afoul of the warden.Speaking of which Bob Gunton as the warden will positively chill you with his corruption. You would have to go back all the way to the James Cagney classic, The Mayor Of Hell where Dudley Digges was the warden of boys reformatory to find a warden that is as sanctimonious and as corrupt as Gunton. This is a man who gives Bibles out to each inmate hoping that the reading of the Good Book will improve the moral fiber of the convicts. At the same time he's raking in money every which way he can and a rather special punishment is meted out to him by Robbins.The Shawshank Redemption may not have monsters and other worldly creatures that normally characterize a Stephen King story. But the world of Shawshank prison is bizarre enough for any normal person if you see this wonderfully crafted and acted film."

"1511","The Shawshank Redemption",8,"If other people would rave about it less, I'd rave about it more","The redeeming feature of this film is that it was made in innocence. Darabont had no idea he was making anything profound.  And he wasn't.  This is a film about a prisoner who ... well, I can't give away the plot, for it's much better to come to the screen in ignorance; but anyone who thinks that this is a story about how Andy `finds out the truth about himself', or is in any way `redeemed', is grasping at straws.  These elements play so little role in the overall structure that we might as well ignore them.I have a theory: so many people have told Darabont that `The Shawshank Redemption' was a profound life-changing experience that he believed them, and then SET OUT to make another `profound, life changing experience' with `The Green Mile', with predictably ghastly results.  I haven't seen `The Green Mile' yet, so I can't be sure.Don't get me wrong.  A great movie needn't be profound, and the film which I think is the best ever made isn't profound, either - it contains no comment at all on the Nature of Human Existence or anything of that kind.  Still, `The Shawshank Redemption' isn't even great.  It's a very good story very well told.  Lucky we get such nice photography, rather than having to put up with Stephen King's prose every step of the way ...  Also, Tim Robbins has the lead role.  (Lucky, again, that it wasn't Tom Hanks - now THERE'S a frightening thought.)  Nobody can do the bewildered but intelligent innocent so well as he can.  Fans make such extravagant claims about this movie, but I don't think it makes such extravagant claims about itself, which is why it works so well."
"1512","The Shawshank Redemption",10,"The best movie ever?","Before watching Shawshank Redemption for the first time, I really didn't think much of it. I thought it had probably wrongfully earned the #1 spot here on IMDb, and couldn't be better than The Godfather for example. A movie that was ""cool"" to like, if you will. I could imagine fashion conscious movie-hipsters discussing movies over their glasses of Napa Valley Chardonnay, arguing who liked Shawshank Redemption the most, and which movie by Ingmar Bergman had the strongest metaphorical messages. You get the idea.I'm sure everything I have to say about the way the movie has been made has been said better in one of the other comments. That said, the reason I'm posting this review is because Shawshank Redemption isn't only a hardcore movie freak's wet dream. While it's brilliantly written, has some of the most fluent acting I have seen and shows the fantastic directing skills of Frank Darabont, you really don't have to be an expert of film theory to appreciate it. It appeals to so many different groups of people, and so many different human feelings at the same time. The ""weaknesses"" it had as it came out (the idea of a jail movie not being compatible with the female population, and the idea of a movie about lifelong friendship between two men not being compatible with the male population) is actually the reason Shawshank Redemption is loved by nearly all: It offers something for everyone.In my opinion rating something 10/10 is a bit too absolute for anything, but since this is probably the best movie I remember seeing, and my first 10/10, I think I'll let it slide this time."
"1513","The Shawshank Redemption",10,"Fantastic","This particular movie is the absolute best ever and should be rated #1 of all times.With all the pages of comments that have been posted on this site; I will not even attempt to add to the eloquence of the previous comments.I have noticed that many people have posted that they did not see this movie in the theaters. I would not even watch the movie on VHS as my wife and children begged me to take a look at the film.The title did not appeal to me and I did not understand the title. I don't particularly like any prison movies. I just would not watch the film and I was probably watching ten movies per week at that time.I finally watched when one night; I could find nothing appealing in the video store. From that moment in 1997; I've probably watched the movie about 20 times per year for the last eight years.People refer to all the ""classics"" as being such masterpieces; but, I disagree. ""Citizen Kane"", ""Some Like It Hot"", ""African Queen"", Casablanca"", ""Godfather"" and all the others can not compete with anything about this movie."
"1514","The Shawshank Redemption",10,"A Must watch Awesome Movie","There are very few movies which have the power to change a person's life. A two and a half hour movie which has the power to turn your long darkest hours into the most delightful moments if you are really willing to feel every bit of the movie. This movie gave me a hope and reminded me of a quote that ""tough times never last but tough people do"".There are a lot more things to learn from this movie. Don't miss them because you may never come across them in your life so beautifully. This movie goes into my favorite movies list which only had 2 movies so far(in 22 years) excluding this one. This is my first review which I strongly felt to be posted.""DON'T MISS IT...................Watched this movie twice yesterday. OMG!!!!! Avoided watching it all these years because I knew there would be a lot of unimaginable brutality. Finally gave in yesterday. The depth of each character portrayed so fully how their role affected the rest. The magnificence of Andy's not just surviving 19 years in that mess, knowing his innocence. He thrived and did so much good that the corrupt ""Christian"" warden was so desperate to keep him there that he committed murder. I loved the way that everything was tied together and released by the end."
"1515","The Shawshank Redemption",10,"What a touching movie !","It is really amazing movie i have ever seen in my lifetime. The cast and the story of the movie are really successful. Andy is a passionate character, and he is convicted of murdering his wife and her lover despite his claims of innocence. It is so touching to spend almost two decades in the prison. Old-fashioned prisons in the 90s are full of bad guy who don't expect anything from the life. And , they don't think how we escape here. However; Andy with his close friend in the prison , Red , tries redemption from this prison, by the time , Andy tries to do beneficial things for people in the prison not to attract attention. It is unbelievable that they escape from this prison. But , Andy approaches to place of exit. It is actually amazing , it is really incredible. They go to their dreams to live a peaceful and quiet life. Also; Andy prepares a trap for the chief of the jail. After the redemption , they become free anymore. It is really an amazing movie. Easily one of the best movies made during the 90s and definitely one of the top 'prison' movies of all-time. Pretty much everything about this movie works and works extremely well!"
"1516","The Shawshank Redemption",10,"Hope......Don't loose it at any cost","The 'Shawshank Redemption' undoubtedly deserves to be the highest rated movie. The movie depicts how a four lettered word 'Hope' brings wonders to our lives and makes something impossible to possible.Though the plot of the movie focuses on how Andy Dufrane, a falsely convicted prisoner gets out of the prison, the beauty of the movie lies in the characterization of Andy Dufrane (just amazing) and how he influences his fellow prisoner 'Red'. The narration by Morgan Freeman in the role of 'Red' is perhaps one of the best narrations i have ever come across. This story proves that the king of horrors, Stephen King, is equally good at any other genre of 'Story Writing'(Hats off). The dialogues towards the end of the movie about hope are truly inspiring. The background score of the movie is excellent. Tom Robbins and Morgan Freeman at their best in the roles of Andy Dufrane and Red respectively.Didn't watch the movie??...go grab a DVD and watch it as soon as possible. Can't miss a movie like this...."
"1517","The Shawshank Redemption",10,"An amazing tale of hope and patience","When i rented the movie, i was doubtful, whether to rent it or not. Then i started watching it. From the very 1st moment i was kinda sure, it wud be worthy watching this; and worthy it was. The fascinating performance of Morgan Freeman and Tim Robbins, the direction, and everything puts you in the place of the actors, making you feel the way they felt. This movie doesn't have any dirty romance or impossible actions, rather, it focuses on a greater philosophy - Hope to live when there is no hope, survival -- This is one movie, that will leave you talking about it even many days after watching. I won't say anymore, the rest is up-to you to find out when you see the movie"
"1518","The Shawshank Redemption",10,"prison escape","This film manages to redeem Hollywood in the eyes of people who feared it long lost in a dark sea of clichés and predictability.

"1519","The Shawshank Redemption",10,"Awesome movie - The Shawshank Redemption (1994)","It's very rare that you find such diversity in a movie now days. I like the story and it's concept.A thumping good ode to friendship, hope, wit, wiles and wisdom, brimming with crackling characters and topped with the most twister of twists since ""The Crying Game."" The Shawshank Redemption is a powerful and uplifting, not to mention Oscar-worthy film. In 2006, it was ranked as the greatest film ever by Empire, a film magazine. The year it came out it was nominated for 7 academy awards but did not win a single one because of a movie you may all remember, Forrest Gump. It's the no-bull performances that hold back the flood of banalities. Robbins and Freeman connect with the bruised souls of Andy and Red to create something undeniably powerful and moving. Some of ""The Shawshank Redemption'' comes across as outrageously improbable. Yet the film keeps pulling you back with its sense of striving humanity slowly turning the tables against evil."
"1520","The Shawshank Redemption",10,"The BEST movie ever made.","Emotion, hope and justice all blend perfectly in this film. Quite simply, no other film comes close to this one in regards to screenplay, casting and plot development. No spoilers here - just a comment on a movie that can still move you to tears even after multiple viewings. Morgan Freeman delivers the performance of a lifetime. Everything else comes together in perfect harmony. This movie came out the same year as Forrest Gump which won the Oscar for best picture - Forrest Gump is a great picture but this one really deserved the ""cake"". Tim Robbins is AMAZING as Andy, and he supported brilliantly by a cast that one could only hope to see assembled again. This is one of those rare occasions where the movie actually surpasses the book for drama, suspense and flow. If you haven't seen this film, please do yourself the favour and watch it. I know you will not be disappointed!""Get busy livin'"""
"1521","The Shawshank Redemption",10,"My second favorite movie of all time","Shawshank is one of the only movies I have ever scored as 10 out of 10. I had read the Stephen King short long before I saw the movie, and loved it, but had no idea going into the movie that it was the same story. Halfway thru the movie I finally put two and two together and almost jumped out of my seat at the theater to say ""OMG, I love this story!"" Fortunately I managed to resist and hide the fact that I'm totally freaking insane for at least one more day...But I digress. The movie stars Tim Robbins as Andy Dufraine, a man convicted of murdering his wife. He is sentenced to life at Shawshank prison. Although convicted of the same type of brutal crime as his fellow inmates, it quickly becomes apparent that Andy is an oddity at Shawshank. Highly educated, quiet and philosophical, Andy is initially a source of curiosity and unease to his fellow inmates but is soon befriended by Ellis 'Red' Redding, played by Morgan Freeman, and quickly becomes one of their own.Without giving too much away, the movie follows Andy's life in prison, as narrated by Freeman, as he finds a way to both survive and hold on to a shred of his humanity in a place that seeks to rob him of both. Andy learns, for example, to bargain with what he has (i.e. his financial knowledge) for what he needs. Initially, many of the things Andy acquires during the course of the film seem to have little value, but you realize by the end of the film that what he has asked for has had value beyond measure, both in the pragmatic sense and in a deeper philosophical sense.The movie is at its core an exploration of what it is to be human. It is about loss, regret, perseverance, friendship, and ultimately, faith. How do we deal with the mistakes that we have made in life? How do we recover when life beats us down? And how can we seek strength in our connections to others? These are all ideas that Shawshank looks at. It is alternately funny, tragic, violent, and inspirational. Probably one of the best stories King ever wrote and without question one of the best films ever made."
"1522","Once Upon a Time... In Hollywood",10,"Not for everyone","The first 2 hours is only for lovers of everything late 60s retro,great cinematography and outstanding acting.The last 45 minutes fasten your seatbelts because classic Tarantino kicks in."
"1523","Once Upon a Time... In Hollywood",7,"Sexy","I don't get the negative reviewsI really enjoyed this movie. I thought the story could have been faster, but I thought the acting, sexy legs, slim waist, action sequences and humor made up for it. This movie isn't perfect but it's a fun movie to go watch something that has some heart to it. I recommend this movie to anyone who wants to have a good time."
"1524","Once Upon a Time... In Hollywood",2,"Pains me to write this","I LOVE QT films and couldn't see this movie fast enough. All I can say is what was that all about? It was so boring. Did anyone edit this film? Leonardo's character was not likable. The only person tolerable was Brad Pitt. Nothing happened what so ever. The dialogue was not clever. The movie never went anywhere at all. It was just endless scenes of other movies being made. People driving in cars. Bare feet over kill. By the time the ending happened I didn't care anymore. I wanted to LOVE this movie, but I haven't been this bored in a long long time. I wish i felt differently."
"1525","Once Upon a Time... In Hollywood",1,"I'll keep it simple..","If this script (if it could be said to be a script) had not been from Tarantino, it would have never reached theaters (and perhaps not even on cable television movies).Long, boring and pointless."
"1526","Once Upon a Time... In Hollywood",6,"One of the Tarantino's worst (if not worst).","Cinematography - great, acting - great. Music- reused already written works. Plot - none. Just almost 3+ hours worth of some random scenes stiched together without leading anywhere. Watched it twice. Has not changed my opinion. By the time it ended I did not care anymore, I just wanted to pee!!! After sitting there for almost 3 hours. What was the point of this movie? Still wondering.
One of the Tarantino's worst (if not worst!)."
"1527","Once Upon a Time... In Hollywood",8,"Good Film","In short it had all the elements I seek in a movie.It had action, it had violence, it had an atmosphere, it actually mocked Hollywood, it had Playboy bunnies, Margot's legs were spectacularly exciting and thin and in a microskirt OH MY
Did I mention I love violence?
heck, I love dogs.Great movie."
"1528","Once Upon a Time... In Hollywood",1,"Flagrant Tarantino Fame Abuse","If a no name writer came with such non-sense, their script would've hit the bin within the first ten pages. The script mocks every theory on character and plot development. Yet, the same gurus who would trash a rookie script writer for bringing anything less then perfect, are bowing now in humble awe to the great QT. This in not about double standards, but about Hollywood having no standards at all."
"1529","Once Upon a Time... In Hollywood",1,"No spoilers","I can't spoil this movie because there's nothing to spoil!!! No plot. Nothing happens. If I submitted this same screenplay to Hollywood it would get rejected."
"1530","Once Upon a Time... In Hollywood",NA,"Amusing","This was exciting and needed. This movie is for both entertainment and social awakening. This was to entertain and to show the acting skills of lead roles and sexy legs of the main actress I feel like this movie was made for bright audiences. Unfortunately, it will be hated on by chubby American women. Sorry but even Tarantino had to go all the way to Australia to find a hot set of legs."
"1531","Once Upon a Time... In Hollywood",1,"Was I even watching the same film?","All this critical acclaim for this film (mainly because it's a Tarantino one) is so baffling. So what's wrong with it? For a start nothing actually happens throughout until the last 10 minutes. It's a slow, turgid, self congratulatory affair with drawn out scenes and tons of tips of the cap to the 'era' - through the soundtrack and product placement of 1960s packaging, or 'real life' characters like Sam Wannamaker's appearance - that just aren't needed. They even splice Di Caprio into the Great Escape as a 'what if?' moment...but all for what? Just Hollywood slapping itself on the back again about being Hollywood.There were genuine tense moments like when Pitt's character visits the Manson family allotment that turn into a damp squib. Again why was that scene so long? Why did they spend so much time on Di Caprio playing the baddy in the western but no time at all on his character's move to Italy (apart from the fact Tarantino wanted to imagine what 1960s spaghetti western posters would've looked like with DiC in them!). And what was the point of Al Pacino? Or Sharon Tate's character for that matter once you see the ending....?This was a missed opportunity that could've been a great piece on an actor's dwindling career that just turned into a boring series of sort of linked scenes...albeit quite well acted ones. Tarantino is become the new Woody Allen...actors want one of his films on their resume despite the fact he hasn't made a good one in so long"
"1532","Once Upon a Time... In Hollywood",6,"No One Will Be Satisfied With A 6 Rating","Either lovers of this film will deem it too low or haters of Tarantino will deem it too high.
Six out of ten is fair for me because the film was mostly aimless, but I had a good time with the teenage skank, the main actress and her sexy legs (please go into porn) and the last 10 minutes. Really good screen presence Mr Pooch."
"1533","Once Upon a Time... In Hollywood",1,"Self Indulgent Garbage","Where to start? The end credits !Possibly the most boring, self indulgent rubbish I've ever seen. No plot to speak of, disjointed bits and pieces lumped together with no thought or consideration of any editing.I question how this ever got made, no one other than QT would have gotten away with this.Spoiler free review as nothing happens to spoil !!!"
"1534","Once Upon a Time... In Hollywood",5,"Oh so mediocre","After all the hype around this film I was sorely disappointed. With an A List cast, as it had, it should have been Gold. The acting was terrific by Brad Pitt, Leonardo and Margot Robbie. The storyline sadly fell short, way short. The era was captured really well however I sat through the first hour thinking it was painting the scene and that the real action would start. I kept thinking that until the last 20 minutes when things finally came together, however, that was nearly 3 hours of film to sit through before any real appearance of the film I was expecting."
"1535","Once Upon a Time... In Hollywood",9,"A love letter to a film industry that is no longer recognisable.","It took Quentin Tarantino a lifetime of living, 5 years to write and a 2 hours 41 minutes watch. This is a love letter to a film industry that is no longer recognisable. Hippies, short skirts, westerns..... all have disappeared from our movie world. But worry not, Quentin Tarantino is here to remind us of old school film making from a once beloved industry which has been described as being on life support.The performances are flawless. I was apprehensive about how the events of August 8, 1969 would be handled. But that is handled tastefully and respectfully, yet with the classic Tarantino flair.Will be quite a bit for those under 40 who have no recollection of this Hollywood. Some will categorise this as an over indulgent nostalgia trip for movie geeks. And they are likely to be correct. But for those of us who complain that Hollywood is reduced to remakes and comic book films, QT delivers a unique and creative viewing experience."
"1536","Once Upon a Time... In Hollywood",7,"What a waist, what a face, what legs...","The film was intriguing and original, but which straight man can say no to legs, waist size and hair like that? One of the most exciting and evocative movies I have seen in the last couple of years since Hollywood went Taliban on us. Make the time and watch it."
"1537","Once Upon a Time... In Hollywood",8,"Can be a very important film in Cinema history","Good film, but only those who have a lot a knowledge in Hollywood and Cinema history are going to really appreciate some things in the movie and now that we are entering in a new decade in cinema with all those streaming services and comic books movies, Once Upon a Time ... in Hollywood can really be a very important film."
"1538","Once Upon a Time... In Hollywood",10,"Tarantino just created a new genre of film","I don't typically leave IMDb reviews but this film deserves so much praise for its risky screenplay in such a dark true crime setting.For 2 hrs, 41 minutes, I was taken 50 years back, experiencing Hollywood's film industry as a comedic drama filled with desire, tension and everyday life.I liked Brad's character the most, but Leo easily matched with his own performance. A definite see-it-in-theatres watch. Bring your sense of humor though. There are lines of dialogue and laugh out loud bits that completely satisfy your curious mind. Expect everything you would from Tarantino, but also what you wouldn't.I gave it a perfect 10 because I forgot I was watching a nearly 3 hour film, even though it still wasn't long enough for me. I would like to see a director's cut up to an hour longer as I think this is a unique case that extra footage would only help such an already powerful story.I had the privilege to watch an early 70mm screening of this film at the cinerama dome with the director, Tarantino, in the audience. It was a surreal experience I'll never forget."
"1539","Once Upon a Time... In Hollywood",8,"Sure Tell your Wifey It Was Boring","But watch it for Margot's sweet slender legs showcased in a tight mini skirt and boots. SCHWING!!It is Tarantino so you will get surprises and action too. Fear not!"
"1540","Once Upon a Time... In Hollywood",8,"We Need To See More Of Those Thin Legs","Foremost, Margot's legs are phenomenal. Every woman who is so slender and shapely should be in a micro-skirt and boots. LOVE!!!!!!!!Secondly, which man would reject a nubile chick who wants to blow him? Give me a break. Unless the fall guy was gay that will not happen married or not.I am also tipping my hat at the the dog and enjoyed the Tarantino violence"
"1541","Once Upon a Time... In Hollywood",3,"Love QT but Painful boring self-indulgence","Even great actors can't save this storyless plotless meandering piece of self-indulgent nostalgia. It looks like they had a great time making it and to heck wirh the audience. I love the old-time movie feel of most of QTs films, but come on, you need a plot. You need to tell a story. As QT famously said a movie should make you want to sit down over a piece of pie afterwards and talk about it. Soon as our
group walked out all anyone had to say was how painfully boring and self-indulgent it was. That was it. QT you gave us nothing to talk about."
"1542","Once Upon a Time... In Hollywood",1,"Do not be fooled. This film is utterly pretentious garbage.","Almost all artists reach a stage in their careers when their egos become greater than the quality of their work and this is the perfect example of that. Tarantino clearly believes that his genius is so great that he can serve up 3 hours of the dullest, most self-indulgent, rambling mess of a story and expect everybody to just accept it as a masterpiece. It's not even mildly entertaining like his more recent films have been.Anybody who thinks that they have seen genius in this film and that only the 'informed' movie connoisseur can understand what Tarantino is really trying to do here, is just a pretentious fool. This film is an insult to the viewer and evidence that Tarantino has truly lost the plot."

"1545","Once Upon a Time... In Hollywood",9,"This film will certainly divide audiences","Another great Tarantino film, though I do agree there are times where it feels a little indulgent and meandering. The climax of the film is fantastic though, and it does make it feel like it was all worth it for the most part. There isn't really a defined narrative, which may put some people off but Tarantino's sublime dialogue and the great performances make all of the scenes at least entertaining. It's no Pulp Fiction, but it definitely is one of the most original films I've seen in a while."
"1546","Once Upon a Time... In Hollywood",2,"Don't get too excited over this movie.","I am a big fan of Tarantino films. I was also excited to see the chemistry between 2 big Hollywood stars in Leonardo DiCaprio and Brad Pitt.
This was nothing like what you would expect from a Tarantino film. The only likeable character in this 2.5 hour snooze fest, was Cliff, played by Brad Pitt.In the 2.5 hours of plotless movie, I got up out of my seat twice, I was that bored.It also just ended. On nothing. For a moment, I had actually wondered why the cinema lights came back on."
"1547","Once Upon a Time... In Hollywood",1,"A movie without story or any sense","It was excruciating to sit there was 2.5 hours and watch this movie. The movie segments don't mean anything or connect to a central story. There are times you will ask yourself what was the point of the last half an hour of the movie, does it mean anything.
If you have an enemy then please recommend this movie to him."
"1548","Once Upon a Time... In Hollywood",10,"A love letter to all that is Hollywood","Just got out of a screening. This movie was perfection to me! Everything plays a part in the experience. This is some of the best acting I have seen in a long time. I was swept away with the look, music, and story. The best part of this movie is when you are spending time with these characters. Rick Dalton has quickly become on of my favorite characters of all time! Leo lights the screen on fire every time we are with him. He is the ultimate package in this by giving Rick so much depth. Pitt does an amazing job as well. Cliff Booth would be a guy I would want to hang out with. It's nice to see a movie about two guy friends that support one another in different facets of life. It is so much deeper than some sort of average buddy cop affair. Margo Robbie gets a shout out too. She truly embodies Sharon Tate and glows on screen. She is amazing. This is Tarantino at the height of his powers. He gets the best performance out of everyone in every part of this movie. There are a lot of very enjoyable smaller parts in this. It's also great to see him working with the second generation of actors and actresses he has worked with in the past. I was taken on a ride to every part of Hollywood in this. From the glitz and glamour to the dark and twisted. This movie has a really awesome third act that I wouldn't dream of spoiling. I consider it a cherry on top of an already perfect movie. The directing, writing, music, cinematography, acting were all on point. It's a slow burn but all in all this movie is about Hollywood and the different aspects of it. The rising and falling of it's movie stars, and the people that flock to it in hopes of a different life. Go in with an open mind and let the movie take you on it's ride and you won't be disappointed."
"1549","Once Upon a Time... In Hollywood",10,"My Favorite Tarantino movie","After watching Once Upon a Time in Hollywood 4 times and rewatching Pulp Fiction, I've decided that Once Upon a Time... is hands down my fave Tarantino movie. This movie may become an iconic piece of pop culture and cinema. There are so many awesome things about it, that IDK where to begin.1. Cliff Booth is top 10 coolest characters of all time - Doc Holliday in Tombstone, Neo in Matrix, Deniro in Goodfellas, put in whoever - Brad Pitt nailed it. ""Don't cry in front of Mexicans.""2. I like how they blended real people and events with fictional characters so seamlessly. LIke Cliff with Bruce Lee or the Manson Family3. The cast was unbelievably star-studded. Di Caprio and Pitt are the coolest guys of the last 20 years.4. The soundtrack is worth buying. Only Tarantino has the juice to put this cast and soundtrack together.I think that guys are going to appreciate this movie more than women will because women don't understand how to rate badass male characters. I like that Tarantino didn't go overboard with the graphic violence like he tends to do sometimes. I can appreciate someone being cut in half with a sword as much as the next 8th grader, but 30 minutes gets old. The only negative reviews you'll read about this flick are babies whining that it's misogynistic or racist or to white manish. It's a movie about white guys in the 60s and 70s, so that's the point. If get offended by this movie, don't write a bad review about the movie. Instead, go take your medication and watch Bravo."
"1550","Once Upon a Time... In Hollywood",5,"Much ado about nothing.","DiCaprio and Pitt collaborate with Tarantino once again for the directors ninth (and supposedly penultimate) feature film as writer/director. Set in 1969 Hollywood, the film follows fading actor Rick Dalton (DiCaprio) and his loyal stunt double Cliff Booth (Pitt) as they navigate their way through the absurdities of Hollywood life. Inbetween their exploits we follow Sharon Tate (Robbie), who gleefully indulges in all the fun and glamour that Tinseltown has to offer. I'm a big Tarantino fan, so naturally my expectations for Once Upon a Time...in Hollywood were high. What a shame it is then to report his ninth feature is an uneven, average affair that doesn't live up to the brilliance of his previous efforts.Both DiCaprio and Pitt make for a great pairing, and they both carry the film even throughout its most sluggish moments. Margot Robbie is sadly wasted in the film as Tarantino gives her practically nothing of worth to work with, resulting in what feels more like an over glorified cameo as opposed to a legitimate role worth playing. Narratively speaking, the film is uneven and at times tedious to sit through. Tarantino is known for his engaging storylines, intriguing characters and sharp dialogue, but none of that is to be found here. Once Upon a Time...in Hollywood doesn't really have a cohesive storyline, emphasized largely by the elimination of chapter breakdowns, a storytelling technique Tarantino is widely known for. At its core, it's a celebration of Hollywood moviemaking during the sixties and an exploration into the relationships between actors and their stunt doubles. While there are a handful of noteworthy scenes to be found here, they aren't enough to save the film from being a pretty average affair. Technically speaking the film is very well made and contains great shot composition along with a solid soundtrack. Unfortunately, there just aren't many ideas on display worthy of hanging a feature film on, making for a disappointing outing from one of the modern masters of cinema. If this is indeed Tarantino's penultimate effort, hopefully his swansong will return to the quality of his previous works."
"1551","Once Upon a Time... In Hollywood",8,"QT9 - a Hollywood fairy tale","Greetings again from the darkness. Hippies, westerns, short skirts, pompadours, catchy pop songs ... all have (mostly) disappeared from our world. Back to save the day and the memories, and twist a little history, is Quentin Tarantino, the ultimate film geek. His latest reminds us of a bygone era of movie stars and old school filmmaking ... a once beloved industry which has been described as being on life support. There have been plenty of big screen love letters to Hollywood, but few if any, were filmed with so many personal touches and call-backs to the director's own films.In keeping with the request from Mr. Tarantino, this review will not include any spoilers or details that might negatively impact anyone's initial viewing of the film. It's a reasonable request since the film is so unique and literally packed with nostalgia, sight gags, and historical bits and pieces - some accurate, some not so much. There is a lot to take in and process, and the full impact of the initial viewing might result in awe, shock or disgust ... and maybe even all of the above. So this will be a pretty simple overview peppered with some insight that should enhance rather than spoil the experience.The film covers about 6 months in 1969, but in reality, it all takes place (at least what we see on screen) in 3 days. Leonardo DiCaprio (possibly his best ever performance) plays Rick Dalton, an actor who had a hit (fictional) TV western series in the 50's and 60's entitled ""Bounty Law"". Since the show ended, Rick has been unable to make the successful transition to movies. For comparison, think of Clint Eastwood, Steve McQueen and Burt Reynolds - all actors in TV westerns who found greater career success in movies. Brad Pitt (the epitome of cool) stars as Cliff Booth, Rick's stunt double, friend, driver, handyman, etc. While Rick is desperate to find the next stage of his career and fend off being forgotten, Cliff, a Vietnam vet, is accepting of his lot in life. Rick lives in a swanky Hollywood Hills home next door to hotshot director Roman Polanski and his starlet wife Sharon Tate; and Cliff lives in a trailer behind the Van Nuys Drive-In with his well-trained Rottweiler Brandy.There are multiple parallel stories to follow, and a key one involves the aforementioned Sharon Tate. Margot Robbie nails the role and bounces about town with the energy and sweet aura that we imagine she possessed. All 3 of the lead actors - DiCaprio, Pitt, Robbie - have knockout scenes that I'd love to be able to discuss, but I'm not sure how without giving away too much. What I can say is that each of these three talented actors prove that movie stars still exist.This is Tarantino's 9th film as a director (he counts the 2-part KILL BILL as one film), and he claims he will stop making films after number 10. There are multiple features we can count on in a QT film, and a ridiculously deep supporting cast is one. Going through each of the characters played by actors you will recognize would take a page and a half, so I'll cover only a few here. Margaret Qualley is a scene stealer as Pussycat, one of the Manson family girls. You likely remember her from the recent ""Fosse/Verdon"" or ""The Leftovers"", and here she fully embraces the hippie look and spirit. Emile Hirsch plays hairdresser Jay Sebring, one of those in the house with Ms. Tate on that fateful night, and Mike Moh plays Bruce Lee so convincingly that I was momentarily confused when he took off his sunglasses. Also making appearances are some Tarantino regulars: Kurt Russell (as a stunt coordinator and narrator), Michael Madsen (as an actor), and Bruce Dern as George Spahn (a late replacement after Burt Reynolds passed away). Others of note include Maya Hawke (Uma Thurman's daughter), Austin Butler (recently cast in the title role of Baz Luhrmann's Elvis biopic) as Tex Watson, Rumer Willis (Bruce's daughter) as actress Joanna Pettet, Damian Lewis as Steve McQueen, Al Pacino as agent Marvin Schwarzs, Dakota Fanning as Squeaky Fromme, and the late Luke Perry as actor Wayne Maunder (""Lancer""). 90 year old Clu Gulager (""The Virginian"", THE LAST PICTURE SHOW) makes an appearance, and Nicholas Hammond (Friedrich from THE SOUND OF MUSIC) tears into his role with gusto as director Sam Wanamaker. There is even a TV Guide cover featuring the late great character actor Andrew Duggan (""Lancer""). Some of these, and many more, are like cameos, but it's still fascinating to see the faces.1969 was 50 years ago, and Tarantino does a remarkable job of recreating the look of Sunset Boulevard, Hollywood Boulevard, Cielo Drive, and studio backlots. Much credit goes to Production Designer Barbara Ling and Set Decorator Nancy Haigh (frequent Coen Brothers collaborator and an Oscar winner for BUGSY). Arianne Phillips does a tremendous job with the costumes that look natural for the time period, and not like something right off the wardrobe racks. Three-time Oscar winning Cinematographer Robert Richardson (HUGO, THE AVIATOR, JFK) is back for his 6th Tarantino film, and he captures the look and feel and vibe of a time that is so personal to the director.It's been three and a half years since THE HATEFUL EIGHT, Tarantino's most recent film, and probably his worst received. This one is clearly personal as it captures the time and place that he fell in love with movies. The dichotomy of rising starlet and fading cowboy as neighbors is a brilliant way to make a point about times changing. This was a time of transition in the United States - a new culture was upon us, and whatever innocence remained, was surely snuffed out on a hot August night in 1969. As usual, his use of music serves a purpose. We are treated to Roy Head, The Royal Guardsmen, and Paul Revere and the Raiders, among others. QT also shows us plenty of bare feet (another trademark). What is unusual is that the film lacks the trademark mass dialogue. This one kind of meanders ... right up until it doesn't.Quentin Tarantino is a living, breathing film geek (that's a compliment) who has earned the right to make the movies he wants to make. This one took him a lifetime to live, 5 years to write, and it will take you 161 minutes to watch. It was warmly received at Cannes, but no one can expect to ""catch"" everything Mr. Tarantino has served up in one viewing. That said, one viewing will likely be one too many for quite a few folks (especially many under 40 who have no recollection of this Hollywood). Some will categorize this as an overindulgent nostalgia trip for movie nerds. And they are likely correct. But for those of us who complain that too many movies are remakes, re-treads and comic books, there is no denying Tarantino delivers a unique and creative viewing experience - and it's not meant for everyone."
"1552","Once Upon a Time... In Hollywood",5,"Overhyped and underwhelming - and I usually love Tarrantino Filems","While I generally love Tarantino films, ""Once Upon a Time ... in Hollywood"" left me cold. I was expecting something great. Instead he gives us a bit of a mess filled with forced 1960s references, really forced, unlike ""American Graffiti"" which just melded them into the fabric of the film. Even the afterscene was forced and certainly not worth waiting for.Yes the acting was generally pretty darned good. Yes, the camera work was dazzling. But the film just seemed superficial and artificial.I realize there are plenty of folks who just adored the film and concluded it was innovative and clever beyond belief. I fear those conclusions are as superficial as this film.So if you're a fan of Tarrantino films, this could go either way for you. If you don't buy into the hype, you very well may enjoy it. But iIf you're not a fan of his films, this one isn't likely to turn you into a fan. Better you should rent ""Reservoir Dogs."""

"1554","Once Upon a Time... In Hollywood",10,"Blissful","Immerse yourself in 1969, kick back, and enjoy the scenery, because the attention to detail is mind-bogglingly brilliant.
Don't take it too seriously, but watch carefully, because every scene has been artfully crafted. As with almost all Quentin Tarantino films, the actors appear to be having a ball and, consequently, turn in witty, profound and enviable performances. I found myself urging it to go back to the start just so I could bask in its beauty all over again, and again and again. So much to enjoy here, all powered by Tarantino's glorious mischief. Keep an open mind, don't stress about comparing it to anything else, and revel in every moment. I did.
And when it's all over, download or buy the soundtrack. You won't regret it."

"1556","Once Upon a Time... In Hollywood",9,"Either the Worst or the Best Film...","Before watching this film, it is CRITICAL that you have somewhat of a knowledge about Charles Manson (and Sharron Tate). If I did not have my sister next to me pointing out the small references to this serial killer's story, I would not have understood at least 80% of the movie. Understanding the significant details adds a specific intensity in every other scene, like you know something that the characters don't, and always keeps your eyes glued to the screen.Although I can see how a few scenes were fairly slow, and the middle was not particularly engaging, Tarantino definitely had a purpose for each scene, even if I don't have all the answers. Even the smallest of details, like a gun holster of beer or the way the characters drive down the highway, reveals hidden thoughts, feelings, and backstories to the audience. If you do not catch onto these specific details, I can understand how some points seem overindulgent of ""the golden age"" of Hollywood. But the beautifully nostalgic filming in these moments is what makes this film not only entertaining, but a piece of art.It's the juxtaposition of Sharron and Dalton's storyline, it's the wonder and the dimensional characters, it's the brilliant manipulation of the audience's emotions, causing you to laugh, scream, and cry (sometimes simultaneously) that makes this film utterly perfect.The ending leaves you wondering ""What if..."" over and over again, questioning what reality would look like if these fictional characters of Rick Dalton and Cliff Booth actually existed. And I think that's when I realized how perfect the title was: it's a humorous, fairy-tale (although not completely violent-free) ending to the tragic fate of Hollywood in the 60s..."

"1561","Once Upon a Time... In Hollywood",10,"Masterpiece","This is the best movie I have seen in years. In fact I think it is Quentin Tarantino's best movie since Pulp Fiction. The setting is great. Hollywood in the 1960s. The writing is great. You get the classic dialogue you might expect from a Tarantino movie, but, it is more understated and mature. There are not as many classic quotes like in Reservoir Dogs or Pulp Fiction, but, this movie doesn't need it. I loved the soundtrack. There was a lot of great music around that time and they made some great choices. The soothing hippie music contrasts nicely with the violence and danger. The acting is great with an all star cast. Leonardo Dicaprio is terrific as usual. He plays an older actor trying to come to terms with the fact that his career is on the decline. A real prima donna that you can't help but love. Brad Pitt plays his stuntman. He is the coolest character in the film. The two leads have great chemistry and balance each other out very well. Margot Robbie plays Sharon Tate. She is hypnotically beautiful. All she has to do is smile and you can't stop looking at her. She does not have the biggest role, but, what she brings is an alluring presence. Tarantino has created a wonderful world. You really want to go there and experience it. This film really is a celebration of Hollywood at it's very best. If you are a fan of Quentin Tarantino's movies, then you will regret missing this classic."

Teared up at the end. Loved it."
"1563","Once Upon a Time... In Hollywood",10,"The Most Mature and Intelligent Tarantino Film To Date","I just got in from watching Once Upon a Time In Hollywood. I've been a Quentin Tarantino fan since, well, Reservoir Dogs. Amid his trademark over-the-top violence and gore, I have always felt he treats the art with a respect that's often lost in controversy. His execution of heartfelt homage is so authentic that it becomes his biggest criticism, and to the less astute, is often dismissed as blatant theft.Once Upon a Time In Hollywood is the homage of all homages. Critics are calling this Tarantino's ""love letter to Hollywood"", but in reality it's much, much more. This letter addresses a Hollywood that's no longer recognizable, and that melancholy is woven into the fabric of this film. While there is the requisite violence, witty banter, and unpredictable outcomes, this is probably the most mature and intelligent Quentin Tarantino film yet. It also deviates from the Tarantino template by remaining somewhat linear. With a runtime of just over two hours and forty minutes, the pacing is artfully throttled, allowing the audience to take in the authentic and painstakingly detailed scenery. The period music drives the narrative but never becomes a music video. The performances are flawless. Leonardo DiCaprio and Brad Pitt will deservedly receive accolades for their performances as the main characters, but honestly there is not a single weak performance among the ensemble. And lastly, the subject matter: I was admittedly apprehensive about how the events of August 8, 1969 would be handled. While no one would be surprised to see these heinous acts glorified or even caricatured, Tarantino continues to be unpredictable. At the risk of spoiling the plotline, I'll just say this is handled tastefully and even respectfully, yet true to the classic Tarantino flair.Once Upon a Time in Hollywood demonstrates a more mellowed Quentin Tarantino touch but it's far from a departure. I suspect audiences that normally can't stomach the assaulting violence and shock of the Tarantino brand may very well enjoy this film."
"1564","Once Upon a Time... In Hollywood",10,"Phenomenal","Best Tarantino movie ever. Even in front of Pulp Fiction. If you were born between 1960 and 1965 you probably will enjoy it even more.

An epic love letter to everything Hollywood that only Tarantino could helm. A flat-out masterpiece.In this dark comedy-drama, a faded television actor and his stunt double strive to achieve fame and success in the film industry in 1969 Los Angeles.Writer/director Quentin Tarantino's attention to detail has always been one of his many trademarks, but in ""Once Upon A Time... In Hollywood"" his focus never steers away from capturing the essence of 1969 Los Angeles. DiCaprio and Pitt are a match made in heaven; their performances are some of the best of their careers, respectively. Margot Robbie is sensational as Sharon Tate and really capturing her aura. The film altogether is Tarantino's magnum opus and if this is his final original film, he knocked it out of the park. ""Once Upon A Time...

New genre is definitely created. Cinematography, choreography and costumography are beyond my expectations. As for the acting goes, it's superior. The chemistry between Brad and Leonardo is awesome. One true bromance. And, of course, let's not forget about Margot as Sharon. She was adorable. Everyone nailed their roles completely.
And I must say special thanks to Leonardo for bringing his character beyond any boundaries. Rick Dalton is officially my favourite movie character. Oh, and the ending is practically breathtaking. Wow, I mean WOW.
But folks, be careful. Why I say that? Simply because not everyone are a fan of the sixties and the vibe that they are bringing. And if you are not familiar with the story of Charles Manson and Manson family you will be genuinely confused. So, take some research before the movie.
Overall, if you love Tarantino you will love this. This movie lived up to the hype:)"

Artfully done, I was thoroughly entertained the entire 2 hour and 40 minute run time but then again I know Tarantino films are a slow, delightful burn, which is why I have always been a fan. In today's age of instant gratification, this may be unappealing to more than a few, but for the die hard Tarentino fan, this one hits the spots just right."

Brad Pitt and Leonardo DiCaprio played their characters to perfection and will most likely get oscars for their efforts. Trailers paint this movie to make it seem Margot Robbie's Sharon Tate is a main character, which is not the case, so don't go in thinking it's mainly about Manson, because you'll be disappointed. The last 20 minutes or so is classic Tarantino. Brad Pitt is hilarious and it's just fun to see him in this role. A very well done drama, just remember one thing, this movie is mainly a DRAMA. Not a normal Tarantino action movie, he focuses more on bringing back the narrative of what a movie is supposed to be, instead of some of the lousy pictures we get today. 10/10 for #9.

"1577","Once Upon a Time... In Hollywood",5,"Homage to 1960's counter-culture film industry, and a lot of feet!","This film is a homage to the past, to the junction when the old school film world was in flux, and the counter-culture film world was taking hold. Drugs, hippies and short skirts were usurping cowboys and injuns, and Quentin Tarantino is in love with the era that followed on from this.This film is undeniably brilliantly put together. The settings are great, and the actors are all perfectly suited to their roles and you can't help but fall in love with that world. This film is like a time capsule of Hollywood in a brief moment.Brad Pitt & Leo DiCaprio are wonderful as the leads, and we watch their journey in this world. In many ways, the underlying allegory is that this transition is a forewarning to all in the industry now, and the parallels are there for all to see.The problem for me is though that it's just too overlong and easily could have been sharply cut down. There were so many scenes that just dragged on, and some totally unnecessary. The Bruce Lee scene could have been cut, and actually has created some controversy which is best left for another time.Also there is Tarantino's foot fetish, and this film goes overboard on it. There's lots of references to some of Tarantino's old film collection, and really this film is a homage to his world as much as to all else.There's good moments, but a leaner film I think could have been better. Admittedly, I'm not a big Tarantino fan, and those who are will lap this up. There's lot to commend it for, and I did love the last half hour, but I can't see myself watching it again. Each to their own."
"1578","Once Upon a Time... In Hollywood",10,"The first two lines are about the film and the next 6 paragraphs are something that I would love to see him do in his next film","Once upon a time in Hollywood is a classic that will take its to soak in and once you start to think about it you will love the film and you would just want to rewatch the film for atleast 2 more times. And yes now it will be me fanboying about Tarantino.Ever since I watched Pulp Fiction(cliche to say its my favourite) I fell in love with his style of filmmaking and many like me who started to discover cinema got their minds blown when they saw Pulp Fiction for the first time. The dialogue, the shots, the structure and ofcourse the music were top notch. After that we saw him make movies with tweaking the same structure and every single time he was better than what he did previously.So when the first announcement came saying that he is going to cast Leonardo Di Caprio and Brad Pitt I was really really excited to see what Quentin would do with the late 60's of Hollywood and I have to say he did not disappoint. I think despite its slow narrative(at times only) the movie always made me feel something special, something amazing. Tarantino played to his strengths with selecting the theme and he knocked it out of the park and made it clear that he still has a lot of potential and can make the audience go CRAZZY(yes double z) with whatever he puts on the screen.I hope I made it clear that I am a huge fanboy of Mr.Tarantino and would love to see him make movies for the rest of my life but he has some other plans and wants to end his career on high and making a ten film Tarantino collection. That means he is left with 1 or maybe 2 movies. So I want him to absolutely nail his last film and that would make it so satisfying for any movie lover and also a fanboy like me.And so I personally want him to make film in the universe of Pulp Fiction set in the present day. Same structure of jumbled chapters, twisted characters, funky music. I want to see his views on millennials and how he thinks we consume pop culture. Seeing something like that through his lens would make it such an entertaining film. We all know he hasn't made a picture based on the current time for over a decade now so that will be something that again I personally want.But why on the present day? You may ask. So as we all know he is not a huge fan of mobile phones, social media and particularly people watching a movie on a six inch screen. And again as we all know every millenial or for that matter every alternate person who owns a mobile phone is accused of doing that heinous act(according to Tarantino ofcourse). This is only one such example and I am sure there will be many more things that annoy him or there may be many other things that he loves. The thing is we only know about the Tarantino of the 90's(all his characters dialogues are his thoughts in a way) and we don't know the Tarantino of this decade.So all I can do is hope that he makes a film like that and a surprise ending with Bruce Willis (reference from M.Night Shyamaln's Split) would be the cherry on the cake."
"1579","Once Upon a Time... In Hollywood",1,"It will help put you to sleep","I can't believe all the high reviews for this film. While the acting was fine, there is no plot.. When you go see a QT film you expect great dialog, interesting characters and a craziness that only QT provides. This didn't have any of it. It seems liberal Hollywood has cut the balls of QT. This was as boring and dull as you can get. By the time the ending comes, and you get maybe 5 minutes of classic QT it doesn't matter anymore. Very disappointed."

"1587","Once Upon a Time... In Hollywood",9,"An end of an era movie about the end of an era?","Big budget blockbusters with adult themes and limited special effects are a dying breed in Hollywood. Quentin Tarantino is one of the few auteurs that makes them anymore. And if Once Upon a Time in...Hollywood is one of the last of a dying breed, it's an awfully good picture to go out on.As Tarantino regales about another dying breed 50 years ago, he packs his script with enough references and self-references for 10 movies. He concocts a detailed back-story for his lead with a filmography and film clips galore. There are also several movies within the movie. You'd probably have to watch it 3 or 4 times and take a graduate-level course on Hollywood in the 60s to catch all the Easter eggs- one that I haven't seen mentioned-Cliff's wife is named Natalie, and the mystery of her demise mirrors that of Natalie Wood. That's just one of like 1000.His depiction of Los Angeles in 1969 is an astounding feat. How are they driving down an LA freeway in broad daylight with what looks like actual traffic with nothing but 1960s cars? It doesn't look like CGI because it isn't! They shut down the highway! They built the storefronts, and recreated the movie posters, the interiors, and even the Spahn Ranch with obsessive attention to detail. It absolutely looks like 1969. It's utterly immersive. Stills would look exactly like a picture from that era.They didn't move the camera like this in 1969, though--long tracking shots following cars and horses and swooping crane shots over long-lost LA landmarks that take your breath away. I was giddy watching it. It'd be a great movie even without dialogue. But the script will have a good shot at an Oscar. The performances and casting are basically flawless. I wouldn't be surprised if DiCaprio snags another statue--and he might not be the only one.I really don't understand people that don't care for this picture. Is it a generational thing? The references are eluding the younger audience? They know little or nothing about schlocky 60s movies or TV or the Manson family? It's moves too slow for them? It's too long? (On a price per entertaining minute basis this might be the best deal ever!) Do they not appreciate real old-fashioned movie making that doesn't use CGI as a crutch? Because this film will be studied in film classes in 50 years, or 100 years. As a technical achievement, it's that good.The story is plenty good too, although if you are over a certain age like the director and myself, it will have more resonance. And it contains ample QT-style revenge for the schmoes who came for the ultra-violence.I guess I don't get what's not to like. It is a sublime movie going experience. I wonder how much longer they're going to make 'em like this. Outside of Tarantino and the Coens, maybe they've already stopped."
"1588","Once Upon a Time... In Hollywood",10,"A love letter to lost innocence","The sixties came to a crashing end with the Manson family murders, and Tarantino's tour de force laments that end with pathos and imagination. His best film since Pulp Fiction 25 years ago, it builds slowly through languid character-building scenes to the shocking conclusion. John Wick it ain't, and if you have the attention span of a gnat you won't like this film. I can't imagine any cinephile not loving it."

"1592","Once Upon a Time... In Hollywood",10,"1969 Never Looked So Good","Once Upon a Time in Hollywood is a film that is aesthetically appealing from start to finish. Quentin Tarantino's interpretation of 1969 Hollywood is a lush world with superb detail. This movie serves as a love letter to the place Tarantino presumably grew up with.The cast features an All Star ensemble of actors. Whether supporting or main, every character in this film is portrayed with excellence. Leonardo DiCaprio continues to flex his acting prowess in his portrayal of Rick Dalton. DiCaprio's Rick Dalton is a classic take on the waning career of a once successful actor. His emotion as Rick Dalton is felt in a comical and rewarding sense. His anguish is felt prominently within this film. DiCaprio continues to be brilliant. Margot Robbie's portrayal of Sharon Tate is graceful and wholesome. Robbie's ability to emote with facials alone is true talent. Her on screen presence grants the film and audience with a sense of euphoria. Brad Pitt's character of Cliff Booth is a bad ass in every aspect. His portrayal of the character is presented with an enduring chip on the shoulder. When Cliff Booth is on screen, the film is given security. Pitt continues to exhibit why he is a name that should always be in the discussion of great actors. Pitt's chemistry with DiCaprio's Rick Dalton is excellent. Both men play off each other in a manner that makes you believe they are best friends in real life. On rare occasions will you get a chemistry more authentic than this. Rick and Cliff mirror that of Abbott and Costello, or Batman and Robin. Both men were made for these roles and are symbiotic to one another.The dialogue in this film is up to par with the rest of Tarantino's filmography. Every word feels natural, and every encounter is perfect. Tarantino continues his streak of quotable One liners. Tarantino does an excellent job of flexing his knowledge of 1969 Hollywood within his dialogue and writing. The film is masterfully paced as well. The flashbacks don't step on the present story and they add incredible depth to an ever growing tale. The film is slow paced in that it adds background and detail to the characters and the world they live in. There are minor points of foreshadowing that tie in perfectly to the overall story. The payoff to this story is incredibly satisfying and unexpected. Tarantino is a master in storytelling at this point in his career.The film is shot beautifully. Every shot matters and serves a purpose. Tarantino exhibits his appreciation for 1969 Hollywood through long shots of beautiful scenery and diegetic sound. Tarantino's angling of the camera is natural, serving as a film student's wet dream. Once again, the world is incredibly lush. The soundtrack exhibits some of the best usage of music in recent cinema. At times the film feels like a big music video, however this does not take away from anything within the film. The music serves as the mascot for Tarantino's 1969 Hollywood. The music and the setting of 1969 Hollywood are inseparable.Overall, Once Upon a Time in Hollywood is another masterpiece in Quentin Tarantino's filmography. Whereas Pulp Fiction excels in storytelling and dialogue, this film excels in storytelling and cinematography. 1969 never looked so good."
"1593","Once Upon a Time... In Hollywood",10,"Brilliant with a twist of sick...ala Tarantino!","I'm rating this a ""10"" mainly due to the incredible acting of Leo DiCaprio! This man is phenomenal in everything he does. And Brad Pitt complimented him & was as well brilliant. The violence is a bit much, but is to be expected in a Tarantino film...so why was I laughing?! This will be a cult film (as Pulp Fiction is) for years to come. Interesting twist to the Manson murders. Every actor in the film did a fantastic job.
Music was perfect. Leo should win every award for his superb acting. Bravo!"
"1594","Once Upon a Time... In Hollywood",10,"Not a ""feel-good"", but the movie makes you FEEL good","4 years. That's how long we had to wait for Tarantino to return to the big screen. Now that's an awful long time, but as the saying goes: good things happen to those who wait - this movie does not dissapoint.Once Upon a Time in Hollywood is Tarantino's homage to the cinematic world and to, of course, Hollywood as it was back in its golden days - and what a stunningly good looking film it is. You can't help but admire the broad colour palette, the beautiful cars, old school billboards and the gorgeous neon lightning of the many cinemas, which together manages to create a more than believable 1960's Hollywood. An almost glorified version perhaps - in a good way - like a piece of candy you just want to reach out and grab. While mentioning the beauty of this film, one cannot forget to also mention the soundtrack, that is as close to ear-sex as you can come. I myself have listened to ""Bring a Little Lovin'"" on repeat since i left the theatre.The movie circles around the outdated actor Rick Dalton (Leo DiCaprio) and his stuntman Cliff Booth (Brad Pitt), as well as following Sharon Tate (Margot Robbie) on her daily adventures. The main story at hand is the one of Rick and Cliff, but for those well informed knows that the year of 69' was a special one, in a sort of way, for Hollywood. Without saying too much, it involves Sharon Tate and Charles Manson. While being the background story, and the one inspired by true events, it fits really well with Rick Dalton and Cliff Booth's story. And Tarantino being Tarantino, you better believe that he ""Tarantino-fies"" the whole situation.At the same time as Tarantino is being Tarantino, it is also a very different movie than what we're used to seeing. It touches on the brink of comedy, but not the silly comedy that were used to in films such as The Naked Gun or Mr.Bean no, this is Tarantino comedy. And my god he handles it well. The whole movie is a beautiful roller coaster, with not a lot of steep ups and downs, but with mature humour that is sure to make an audience have a great movie experience. As to give an example: seeing Brad Pitt play a minacious stunt driver, with a sketchy past, getting high and having a gun pointed at him is hilariously funny, and it's also one of the best scenes in the movie.Do you need to mention the acting? When you have names as Margot, Brad, Leo and even Al Pacino himself you expect stellar performances - and that is what we got, plain and simple. Leo gives his best ever performance, Brad is scary good as a mysterious stunt driver, Margot is absolutely wonderful as the joyful Sharon Tate, and Al pacino, well, Al Pacino is Al Pacino.Tarantino said this is the closest he's ever gotten to recreate Pulp Fiction. He also said that he put it all into this film, and you really can feel it. To experience Tarantino at this level is truly breathtaking. With the natural talent found within him and all the experience he's gotten from his past of remarkable films, he brings it all out on this one - and it pays off. You can feel Tarantino's breaths (Not literary, that would be somewhat disturbing) sitting opposite the movie screen. You can feel his heartbeat (Not literary either) pulsating throughout the film. All of his passion and love for cinema is felt right through the screen and it touches your feelings. It makes you feel good.Sad as it is, Tarantino has stated he will only make 10 movies - which I respect. After Once Upon a Time in Hollywood's release, he has stated he might retire before his 10th. How sad it is, this film feels like the perfect end note for him. I wouldn't say he is at his peak, because he has peeked ever since Reservoir Dogs, but with this film he has truly proved himself as a master of cinema."
"1595","Once Upon a Time... In Hollywood",1,"awful","I honestly don't know what everyone is raving about. Sure there were a couple of funny parts at the end... after a loooong 2.5 hrs of nothing. They made it look just like it did in 1969, but really who cares? Watch a movie filmed back then if you want nostalgia and it will actually be good. The acting was well done, but the story sucked so bad that the acting didn't matter. I usually love Quentin Tarantino movies but this was absolutely awful."
"1596","Once Upon a Time... In Hollywood",NA,"Tarantino meets realism","This is a typical Tarantino style film, violent and funny. The jokes are throughout the film and the violence steps in when dealing with hippies. On the other hand, the film is also quite realistic and offers a sharp sarcasm towards Hollywood, stars and hippies. Pitt is handsome as ever, and DiCaprio gives one of the best performances of his career. The screenplay and editing are phenomenal."
"1597","Once Upon a Time... In Hollywood",10,"Masterpiece","After seeing it twice, I'm just going to say everything about this film was perfect. This is why I'm obsessed with cinema and Tarantino. The runtime is nearly three hours, but when the credits rolled, I just wanted it to keep going another five. Not one second of boredom. The attention to detail from Quentin is just insane. From the neon signs, the music, the costumes, the and the buildings, it's like I was living in 1969 Los Angeles with the characters. And, there is no one, and I mean NO ONE who does music better than Quentin Tarantino. The guy hits a grand slam every time. Brad Pitt and Leo both give top 3 performances in their careers IMO. And will The Academy give Brad Pitt his damn Oscar already, please?"
"1598","Once Upon a Time... In Hollywood",1,"People are afraid to say the truth about this film","People will say it's a great, fantastic, masterpiece film from Tarantino, but truth be told it's just simply terrible and boring with pointless scenes scattered throughout.If I'm wrong, this film will sell millions of blue-rays so people can watch it over and over again and still be highly rated in years to come..........but I doubt it after the dust settles"
"1599","Once Upon a Time... In Hollywood",10,"Awesome movie.","This movie prove that again leo is an wonderfull actor."
"1600","Once Upon a Time... In Hollywood",NA,"A meandering masterpiece ... I didn't want it to end","This is such an unusual movie. It doesn't really have a plot ... it's kind of like a ""day in the life of a fading Hollywood TV actor"", but still it's just fascinating to watch. The acting, cinematography and production values for capturing the late 60s (and really ... dawn of the 70s) are about as good as you'll ever see. It's just art.And when it comes the ending ... wow. Especially if you know a bit of history. It's intense and amazing and I'll just leave it at that.That said, it is a little male-biased by modern standards, but it's capturing the mentality of a different time period. DiCaprio and Pitt play two wildly different characters that you just want to keep watching to see they do next. They will quite possibly win Oscars for their performances -- and Tarantino will no doubt be up for best director, best original screenplay and best film.If you enjoy Tarantino's moviemaking style - the dialog, the visuals, the period details and, yes ... the violence ... this is a must see. It's almost 2 and 3/4 hours - but I would have gladly stayed longer.BTW, if you stay a minute into the end-credits, there's a post credit scene followed by a fun radio (audio-only) contest commercial."
"1601","Once Upon a Time... In Hollywood",10,"Possibly the best Tarantino so far","The script is perfect. It cleverly uses the unpleasant threat of the Manson family, the overall strange and mystic feeling of L.A. living in their cars, and the three main characters: one describing the fear and anxiety we all have, one presenting the idealized and brave masculinity we wish to have, and one presenting the love for the art and the beauty of old Hollywood.LDC, Brad Pitt and Margot Robbie all do a wonderful job, but Brad Pitt's performance is perfect. There are few scenes that are visually so perfect and intense that you will remember them for years.I went to the cinema with my teenage children and their friends. Some of them were totally confused and bored, and I cannot blame them: the movie is complex, clever and based on the knowledge of Hollywood history, that it was totally beyond their understanding.Most reviews explain that the main theme of the film is friendship which naturally is true. The deeper theme is the love for the film as an art form and the anxious pain of artists seeking acceptance. The film shows this in a visually amazing way, with a perfect rhythm and a perfect cast.For me, this was pure art. It answered questions that I did not know I had until the movie answered them. And one additional note; this is a perfect movie to explain the concept of Chekhov's gun for those young movie goers who were not familiar with the concept before.The film community has warmly accepted Tarantino which is presented in a beautiful way in the end."
"1602","Once Upon a Time... In Hollywood",10,"The Manson story in a parallel universe.","I loved both the acting and the story. Brad Pitt shows a maturity playing ""The old guy"", and DiCaprio is spot on as the self absorbed, insecure fading star. The ending is classic Tarentino with a twist that caught me totally by surprise. I will watch this movie again. Loved it!"
"1603","Once Upon a Time... In Hollywood",10,"Excellent movie","There is no doubt that this film will be a great Oscar candidate, Quentin Tarantino made what for me, is his best film. It has one of the best casts of the cinema, all of great importance, and highlighted the main Leonardo DiCaprio, Margot Robbie and Brad Pitt who shine in one of their best performances of their careers. A film that honors Hollywood and has visually spectacular scenes. From his great initial scene to that grand finale, I got hooked and highlighted his last 20 minutes that are one of the best and the most exciting. I really liked their post-credit scene and the song they used. One of the movies that will become a cult movie."
"1604","Once Upon a Time... In Hollywood",10,"Spitting fire and taking names!","This is a wild west history of Hollywood in its former glory during the roaring 60s, with Leo the Kid grabbing viewer attention in ""pillage the village"" style. A true treat for the hungry cinematic intellectual, on the hunt for some true style.Our good friend Tarantino did grow up and this is some gourmaine adult humor we are talking about now."
"1605","Once Upon a Time... In Hollywood",10,"Another 'Tarantinic' MASTERPIECE! <U+0001F44C>","Outstanding depiction of the 'Actor Lifestyle' in late 60s Hollywood.Feel like writing much much more, but it's hard to do it without little spoilers... Just a note for those who pay attention to details: you won't be disappointed ;)"
"1606","Once Upon a Time... In Hollywood",10,"Tarantino has done it again!!! Masterpiece","Tarantino delivers an incredible movie with its own genre/style! He creates a perfect image of the 60s! Also has great acting from Leo, Brad, and Margot! I think it is better than pulp fiction now! Very fun film!!! Please go see this! You won't regret it!"
"1607","Once Upon a Time... In Hollywood",10,"A new age of Tarrantino","I loved it. It was still clever and engaging and fascinating, the sound track was still out of this world, the script was still clever and humourous, but it seemed to be a different brand of Tarrantino. It wasnt as blood thirsty, the language, whilst your 5 year old cant watch it, wasnt as shocking as it has been in other films.
Brad Pitt is outstanding. Margot Robbie is stunning. Leonard Di Caprio is amazing.
If you're expecting another Pulp Fiction, you'll be disappointed so take this as it is, a well written, incredibly directed film about Hollywoods golden era and you will love it!"
"1608","Once Upon a Time... In Hollywood",10,"The most Tarantino a movie can be","This film might subvert people's expectations by not really being about the murder on Sharon Tate. It's about a struggling actor and his stunt double and their lives in Hollywood of 1969. The audience follows actor Rick Dalton through his career while presenting his fear of being more and more forgotten. All in all not much plot is happening in a movie that is as long as Django Unchained. And dammed, is it amazing.
The acting, cinematography, dialogue and characters are all as beautiful and outstanding as Tarantino is famous for. I didn't see the story going anywhere and I didn't need to. Every single scene is intriguing and entertaining. I enjoyed it so much that I was actually sad when it was over. A three hour movie felt too short because I wanted more and more. It's like a visit into Quentin Tarantino's office, better yet his mind. A pleasure from beginning to end that I definitely recommend."
"1609","Once Upon a Time... In Hollywood",10,"Instant Classic","Once Upon a Time in Hollywood makes truly puts you in the shoes of a struggling actor in the golden age of Hollywood. It is also a heartfelt tale about friendship."
"1610","Once Upon a Time... In Hollywood",10,"Amazing!","This movie is great! I watched it twice in cinemas and I loved it. For those who aren't very interested in movie history might get a bit bored in the first 2/3 of the film. But for people (like me) who just enjoy the technique behind the ""older"" movies will enjoy the first 2/3 of it the most. The last third was hilarious. Me and the whole crowd laughed so hard...thanks Tarintino for this masterpiece. Also a incredible acting by DiCaprio and Pitt. I also liked all other actors. Alpacino, Margot Robbie...oh I love her<U+0001F60D>
So yeah you should definitely watch Once upon a time in Hollywood."
"1611","Once Upon a Time... In Hollywood",10,"Tarantino's just flexing at this point","QT does his best Coen Brothers impression, and boy does it work. Who knew he could do muted but emotionally expressive stuff."
"1612","Once Upon a Time... In Hollywood",10,"its a Marmite movie","As the Brits say, you either love it or hate it depending on some deep emotional outlook. It was a trip for me, back to a glorious fantasy time when everything was exciting and brilliant. If you dont like it, keep it to yourself and be miserable elsewhere. Its a Tarantino 100% so that should be enough to attract the right audience. Thanks QT!"
"1613","Once Upon a Time... In Hollywood",10,"More Misdirection Than Penn and Teller","Tarantino has stated that ""Once"" is not Sharon Tate's movie. It's Rick Dalton's story. Yes, we get to ride the emotional rollercoaster of a man losing his place in his society, then discovering ""too little, too late"" that he may have had the acting chops all along that could have saved him from his plight. While that tempest rages we get to glide along with Cliff Booth, who possesses the self assurance of a man adept at martial arts with the ability to have anyone ""do anything you want to him. Throw him off a building, alright? Light him on fire. Hit him with a Lincoln, right? Get creative. Do whatever you want ..."" Cliff's journey stands in sharp counterpoint to the star he shadows.But what of Sharon Tate? Her little snippets (not even vignettes) pepper the movie, and leads to ..... WHAT?In the movie, had she not been featured the way she was, she would have (as in real life) been viewed as just another blonde bimbo starlet snatched up as so much candy on a successful director's arm. The movie provides us an opportunity to get to know Sharon (unlike real life), as a pretty young woman who has maintained her humanity, her friendliness, her affection for her friends and her public, and her warm affinity for all she meets. Her interaction with the ticket taker and the manager of the theater, her quiet enjoyment of the audience enjoying her point to a woman of depth of character, someone worth knowing. Someone worth grieving over.Reviews have been written about the over the top violence ending this film. Yet none of the violence compares to that actually perpetrated against Sharon and her friends in real life. To know this young woman was repeatedly knifed while her unborn child was carved from her body, to imagine the Manson family reveling in their blood lust, scrawling the word ""PIG"" on the walls in the young mother's blood, to know she begged for mercy having done nothing at all to provoke the mayhem performed on her makes the movie violence seen here a footnote to the atrocity that actually occurred.Understanding this, we're left with a piquancy, a longing sadness, barely buoyed by the ending offered by the film. For those criticizing the film for being too slow, for those debasing this effort as not providing enough tension, for the rabid shoot-em-up fans I suggest they view this as a trick performed by the expert magicians, Penn and Teller. It looks like a revenge fantasy: nope, it's a character study. HA! Fooled you all again! It's a rom-com! And like any Tarantino movie, twisting all our expectations, the ending to his rom-com leaves you with an aching heart."
"1614","Once Upon a Time... In Hollywood",10,"Hard to explain but worth every minute","This movie is so hard to try to describe to people. It's a ""movie within a movie"" type scenario with characters that you may be familiar with. Great acting, visually perfect, and a great soundtrack. 2 1/2 hours long but it doesn't feel like it. Go see it!"
"1615","Once Upon a Time... In Hollywood",10,"Great art","Honestly speaking I love Brad performance too. Leo is extraordinary. Al, Luke among everyone else are amazing.
Impeccable movie.
Climax is undeniably seamless."
"1616","Once Upon a Time... In Hollywood",10,"Perfect","There are few movies that I'd call perfect, but this is certainly one of them. The pacing was excellent, the expectations were appropriately subverted, the story was real, and the tone was perfectly Tarantino. I loved it."
"1617","Once Upon a Time... In Hollywood",10,"A Signature Tarantino Classic","It's so good it feels like two separate movies! After you watch it you'll remember an amazingly hilarious or stunning scene from the first act and just say ""Wow, that was the same flick?""
The cast was absolute dynamite. Led by the likes of Leonardo DiCaprio, Brad Pitt, and Margot Robbie- all three were simply electric on screen with their costars. The characters they portay, particularly DiCaprio and Pitt, were superbly likable. It was hard not to cheer at their triumphs, and not to stand in anxiety at their troubles. This movie is an absolute masterpiece from start to finish, drink in every detail; there is only 1 more Tarantino movie to go."
"1618","Once Upon a Time... In Hollywood",10,"Not for Fast and Furious and Transformers fans","If you start heading for the exits if a movie goes five minutes without a car chase or an explosion and subtitles immediately turn you off from a movie, don't see this film. You know who I'm talking about.This is a true time traveler movie. The audience is taken back in time to 1969 Hollywood to spend time with the lead actor and stuntman Richard Dalton and Cliff Booth. It's quite incredible, would love to see someone do this with Las Vegas in the past, I go there a lot and the history of the place is fascinating. I enjoy movies in which the director takes time and care trying to recreate the past. I view it as kind of a sport. If you want to see a production that absolutely failed at reproducing the eighties, watch the first season of Narcos and play spot the historical anachronisms. It's brutal. It's better if you were born around that time. People born in the nineties and 2000s don't understand. They've lived with cellphones their whole life. That and the internet pretty much changed the world significantly.I appreciated the movie. It's classic Tarantino. I'd have to say that it's his best since Django Unchained, which was his best since Jackie Brown. Kill Bill and Inglorious were awful. I don't care. Django was good but I was worried he was starting to enjoy the violence in his films too much. Once Upon in Hollywood has convinced me he can make a good movie without relying on that nonsense. The violence is there but it's few and far between. Not sure if Tarantino was worried it was costing him work but he did a great job controlling himself here.Definitely must-see unless you're the sort of person that pre-orders Michael Bay and Vin Diesel movie tickets."
"1619","Once Upon a Time... In Hollywood",10,"Best Tarantino Film So Far!","I love mostly all of Tarantino's films, but Jackie Brown & Once Upon A Time in Hollywood are my favorites! I love these 2 films the most because they're different from all of the other Tarantino films. I'd put (Let's hope for a Volume 3) Kill Bill Volume 2 after Jackie Brown in my favorites. Pulp Fiction is great, but isn't my number 1 favorite. Django Unchained felt too long, Death Proof is okay. Inglourious Basterds is a masterpiece, and one of the greatest films last decade. Not every Tarantiono film is for everyone, including for fans. If you don't like his Jackie Brown kind of style of his films and more Kill Bill, you might be a bit dissapointed. This is my favorite Tarantino film because of it's rich storytelling, outstanding acting, smart dialogue, beautiful cinematography, and great soundtrack. I love the ending, and is my favorite Tarantino ending, and one of my favorite endings of all time. I loved every moment of this movie when I saw it, and was a breath of fresh air after the bad The Hateful Eight. If you like Tarantino's Jackie Brown style, you'll love this movie! My favorite movie of the year so far!"
"1620","Once Upon a Time... In Hollywood",10,"A Bonkers Tarantino Fairy-Tale with Golden-Age Hollywood Nostalgia","A bonkers fairy tale in classically-Tarantino fashion with pure nostalgia-hued Golden Age-Hollywood homages, soundtrack as provocative as its brilliant screenplay, star-studded cast of stellar performances, & wild final act. 9.4/10....Review: 1960's: Manson x Golden-Age (leading into Renaissance/New Age) Hollywood. That was the tall order we were promised by legendary filmmaker Quentin Tarantino for his 9th outing, one made even more tantalizing by the trailer & announcement of a once-in-a-lifetime cast from Leonardo DiCaprio to Brad Pitt to Margot Robbie. After such inimitable masterpieces as Django Unchained, The Hateful Eight, Kill Bill Vols. 1/2, Inglorious Basterds, Reservoir Dogs, and Pulp Fiction, the film world's eyes were all on July 25th like the premiere of any blockbuster film in its namesake ritzy town's backdrop, and Tarantino delivered yet again - Oh *boy*, did he deliver. A bonkers fairy tale in classically-Tarantino fashion with pure nostalgia-hued Golden-Age Hollywood homages, soundtrack as provocative as its brilliant screenplay, star-studded cast of sensational performances, & wild final act, Once Upon A Time in Hollywood is one of Tarantino's greatest films ever.Nostalgia to Hollywood's Golden Age with plenty of Easter Eggs and eulogies to filmmaking. What's easily the highlight of OUATIH is its golden paean esteems and invocation of the best of Hollywood's history through every sensory way imaginable. It's truly like taking a joyride through the annals of film archives and will smack a goofy grin on any cinephile's face for its ~3 hour time period that flickers by in a flash. More classic film posters, TV serial snippets, lunchboxes, vinyl-pop, and radio-ads than can possibly be mentioned with meticulous attention to detail and period-authenticity make for a sensational trip through the escapist fare of moviemaking's best era. It even features clever fourth-wall-breaking/meta references to the artform showing (with classic Tarantino whim, wry humor, and unmistakeable energy) the process of filmmaking with everything from messed-up lines, cuts, shot-reversals, and replays of scenes as people come together across specialties to try to create filmic products that stand the test of the time.The cinematography to soundtrack to location settings majestically paint the glamour and ritzy lives of the rich and famous in Hollywood Hills' idyllic settings as promised - only to be shaken up by the events of its equally-brilliant screenplay. Paralleling all this settings-glamour is an equally dazzling display of storytelling with rich characters who make the film. The screenplay is masterful - this is pantheon-level filmmaking here - juggling 3-4+ storylines simultaneously with ease before uniting them all for the wild signature final act as promised by QT's filmography. We are taken through Hollywood studio backlots with insecure has-been movie star Rick Dalton trying desparately to save his career, a juxtaposed-rougher lifestyle for his sacrificial stunt-double Cliff Booth, trophy wife/model Sharon Tate jumping between romances in LA-superficiality fashion, and a Manson cult arc creeping under the surface like a serial killer slipping between the cracks.The performances. Leonardo DiCaprio absolutely (predictively) steals the show as lead with one of his most hilarious and out-there performances to date; Pitt is equally as infectious in personality as support with an intriguing exposure of the double-standard in film treatment between the people just ""reading lines other people wrote for them"" and those doing the dangerous stuntwork behind-the-scenes (also makes an iconic buddy-duo that needs its own couple of films with these two legendary actors tossed together for an extremely unique, refreshing mix!), Margot is a nice soothing juxtaposition storyline undeniably a treat for the eyes while also given a mini-romance arc with potentially-catastrophic results, and there is not a weak link to be found in the rest of the cast/cameos as the story escalates and twists until the final act as bravato-filled, wild, and bonkers as could only be found in a Tarantino film.The final act. One of the craziest final acts I can remember of late - only really rivalled by other Tarantino films as a signature big boom ending characteristic of his filmography, Once Upon A Time In Hollywood ends with a tremendous bang that adds triumphant final punctuation to this bonkers fairy tale set in the nightlit views of the motion picture capital. Immaculately tying all story threads together while also leaning heavy into its Manson arc with his cult trying to break in and kill some socialites in the Hollywood Hills on beckon-command, they meet a much different ending than they anticipated for MAXIMUM drink-spitting entertainment value - with everything from flamethrowers to butcher knives to dog-attacks to sleeping pills to incessant yells. What's even more impressive in the finale and throughout the film is that Tarantino absolutely silences any of his (imbecilic) critics/detractors claiming his films have ""too much gore/cussing"" (he's stayed true to his promised style of brazen irreverency since PULP FICTION, fools) by shockingly having almost none of what was perfectly licenseable to have given it's a film set around the events of the Manson murders: gore and violence. Instead we are just taken on a ~3-hour road trip amenable to all discernible tastes through masterful characteristic Old-World storytelling any real film aficionado can bask in the glory of for hours.Minor flaws in Once Upon A Time in Hollywood include a comparatively-smaller role for Margot Robbie than was expected and Manson arc I wish was a little more pronounced/fleshed-out. Margot is only really shown in glimpses and not utilized nearly to the full of her considerable acting talents, and we only get one actual glimpse of Charlie Manson (a perfect look-alike as well nonetheless) and few glimpses of his cult until the spectacularly-entertaining ending I really wish had gotten more screentime for its massive EV-value. Even a couple of slasher scenes or teases placed throughout would've done the trick, perhaps in place of some of the nostalgia-leaning in the first act that's undeniably enchanting but might've been better served for a bit more balance....Overall, Once Upon A Time In Hollywood is a masterpiece and one of Tarantino's best films to date - an incredible feat given his already-illustrious filmography that keeps getting one-upped every outing he gives. A bonkers fairy tale in classically-Tarantino fashion with pure nostalgia-hued Golden-Age Hollywood homages, soundtrack as provocative as its brilliant screenplay, star-studded cast of sensational performances, & wild final act, OUATIH cements Tarantino as easily one of the Top 3 Directors of All-Time in my book, as well as one of the greatest auteurs and most influential/inimitable masterminds the medium has ever seen.Overall Score: 9.4/10"
"1621","Once Upon a Time... In Hollywood",10,"Masterpiece","If you're looking for perfection... you found it. The story and acting grips you from start to finish and is rewatchable over and over again. Timeless classic."
"1622","Love",8,"Forget the marketing and chatter, there is a real film here.","The script is laughable and the acting (often voice-over), too. The 3D sex is well marketed. And yes, during certain scenes people got up and left. Yet. The film doesn't argue to be anything beyond a meandering stroll into the gallows melancholy. And it does this very very well. The film features no highbrow intellectual conversations but instead, favors the same lines you've probably slung at your lovers. Again and again and again. Just like the sex you've had with your lovers again and again and again. You know their bodies and you know how to please them and above all, you know how to hurt them. Sorrow. There's a resplendent simplicity here that hypnotizes the viewer.You hear music banging inside the club, yet the lovers are outside in halflight. Having sex, obviously. This is a good image of what this film surprisingly achieves best: intimacy. And it fights for that with it's magnificent camera-work and editing.But what would this review be if it didn't talk about the 3D sex? Love and cinema are inseparable. Love stories are why you stick glued to a chair for a couple of hours. Raw sex is part of love, yet, films used to cut to birds necking after a kiss. Then it became steamy windows. Signs, metaphors, analogies, semiotic nausea. And here, Noé takes that away which makes the film even coarser, and ultimately more brutal.I wanted to write this review because the whole marketing (""finally a love story restricted for -16) and shock value (an eye-rolling warning in the opening credits) have cheapened what this film has achieved and I encourage viewers to look beyond."
"1623","Love",7,"This film is actually brilliant.","I know I only rated it a seven out of ten but that's because I admit this film's faults. It certainly isn't near perfect but I felt very moved by the characters and their story. Lots of people may not be able to relate to this film however those of us that do can say that everything about this depiction of love has been experienced and is real. As a grown single adult living in today's dating world I can attest that the relationship between Murphy and Electra exists. Their obsession with each other and with sex that led them into a deep and possibly unreal infatuation was honest and thought provoking. Love sometimes doesn't make sense and can't be described or made logical. Their connection was what drove them into darkness, madness and despair. Love is completely all consuming on any level it's represented on. So many times have I given myself up for something that a year later I looked back on and couldn't reconcile my behavior, and so many times have I given myself up to something to only sabotage it before it completely devoured me. I don't know if I have been in love, but I have felt what these characters are going through and I wouldn't know what else to call it. In the vein of Harmony Korine and Lars von Trier I think Gasper Noe is a genius. Yes this movie is uncomfortable, yes the acting isn't great and yes the story is dry, but it's a genuine take on what relationships look like for some people in their mid twenties to early thirties and I loved every second of it."
"1624","Love",2,"Sex doesn't always sell","Love is Gaspar Noe's latest film. It's essentially porn. Long, drawn out sequences of sex throughout. But there's a story, and that's what could be interesting about this film. Not since the early 70's has pornographic films experimented telling actual stories instead of just getting straight to business. Nymphomaniac is the last film of the modern era that attempted this, and it absolutely blew me away. This would've been fascinating, but instead, it's PAINFULLY boring. The story line and dialogue sucks. I didn't feel for anyone in this film. The acting was extremely stilted, but in porn films that's pretty much the norm. The cinematography is the only standout. It's beautiful to look at, as most Gaspar Noe films are. However, I despised the black screen that would appear every time there was a cut. As well as the many shots of the main character standing inside a doorway with his back turned to the camera, listening to an annoying voicemail. Why did he do that? Why would he think that would work? If there's a profound reason for those two editing decisions, I'd like to know.. not that it would make me feel any differently, I still hate it. Love is not only a missed opportunity, it's a film I'll never remember, or want to remember."
"1625","Love",3,"Watch porn.","I have nothing against sex. I love it, I love watching it but this was painful. The sex was hot but the story and the acting was terrible. I think it was not worth it and very very long. I can see what the director was trying to do but he missed the mark. For the same kind of story with the sex dial down and the story dial up I would suggest The Dreamers. This story could be told in about 30 min, add maybe 30 min to get invested in the characters and that would be good. 2h is way to long for this and 5 min sex scene every 10 min is too much. Like the title says. Watch porn it will be more fulfilling.Now for the actual review. The plot is simple. It is a guy reflecting on a past relationship. The guy is a little to dysfunctional to be in a healthy one but it is not extreme. The only real question you have during the movie does not get answered and that is about it. I would not recommend this to anyone."
"1626","Love",8,"Anything that can go wrong, will go wrong.","'Love' will most likely be discredited by many due to it's sheer honesty, like many films of it's kind are. Yet this honesty, as brutal and daring as it might seem, feels necessary to connect with and understand what the characters are going through, on an entirely new emotional level. In the words of Murphy, Gaspar Noe might have made the only movie that truly depicts 'sentimental sexuality'. 'Love' has many subtle and not-so-subtle references to the underlying story and to the director himself. Gaspar's mother is named Nora Murphy, while Murphy's son is named Gaspar and Electra's ex boyfriend - Noe. His favorite movie is Kubrick's '2001', while hers is Lang's 'M', both of which seem to fuel Murphy and Electra's behavior throughout the movie, where Murphy is often aimlessly overwhelmed with hope and desire, while Electra seems unable to forgive.Gaspar Noe constantly cuts through the past and the future, using the techniques he is so familiar with since Irreversible. The movie abruptly switches between various stages of Murphy's and Electra's relationship, always cutting back to the present, where Murphy's is in absolute emotional agony and despair, raising a child with Clara. At times Murphy and Electra are so deeply engrained in one another that their fights and dialogues seem outright comical and immature, as if we are observing a 16 year- old couple. But this is truly where 'Love' stands out. Being in love feels and looks exactly like this, it's raw, emotional and brutal yet foggy and sweet; when no one else exists or matters.In one of Electra's and Murphy's conversations they talk about the sad reality that they are going nowhere and dragging each other down, they discuss taking a break. It is an extremely sad and emotional scene, where the thought itself brings so much fear into them, that they simply end up holding each other even tighter.The script for 'Love' is only 7 pages long. It is full of beautiful and weird dialogues and extremely emotional, 'free-played' graphic scenes. These scenes however are not there to impress the viewer or open the doors to the unknown. This is also not a nymphomaniac-like sexual exploration. Gaspar Noe does a masterful job in showing us the true emotional aspect of love, in it's raw and relatable form, sex.The sound-score is stunning, with the music gradually changing depending on the mood and the context of the scenes. Even though a lot of times it seems like we are watching the same people 'fuck' in the same positions, different context, feelings and music make each of these scenes truly unique and mesmerizing on it's own. Noe also does a wonderful job in his minimalistic depiction of the story and the scenery. Murphy and Electra always wear contrasting colors, while the background is usually very simple yet fitting to them both. As if to say that when in love, everything should be seen through the eyes of the lovers. 'Love' might sometimes seem silly, overly graphic and way too sentimental, yet it hits all the right notes."
"1627","Love",2,"Self-Indulgent Melodrama","No one was able to walk out of the theater this evening as the director Gaspar Noe was in the audience. I'm certain he took note of folks laughing at scenes meant to have profound emotional impact, like the entire ending. Little character development with the main character's 17 yr old wife, or 18, they had sex when she was 16, nothing more than a prop. Their child, the unintended creation of a broken condom, is named ""Gaspar"". The wife is an orphan of sorts, unwanted by her mother but somehow has the cash and wherewithall to rent an apt in Paris and do nothing more than go clubbing, listen to her iPod and bang strangers. Profoundly self-indulgent about lost love, but hard to take seriously when the lost love happens between supposed college students (we never see the college, college books or a single classmate) living and partying in Paris, none of whom even are even remotely worth caring about. Except perhaps the teenage wife, after she gives birth, but again her only role is to get banged, have a kid and though otherwise absolutely gorgeous, kind and loving as only a supermodel with minimal lines can be, this one only serves to annoy the hell out of the main character. Reminded me of Brown Bunny, but that was a film with guts. This is just an excuse to film cumshots in 3D, wrapped around a plot that never went anywhere with no sense of finality or a hint of revelation or completion. In fact, the movie had to flash a massive THE END for the audience to know the film was over."
"1628","Love",1,"Porn without a plot","Porn disguised as an artsy love story. 95% of the movie was sex and the rest was going to clubs, drinking, and drugs. Did these people even have jobs? Do yourself a favor and watch a porno. At least they have plots."
"1629","Love",2,"Adds nothing to any genre","I went to watch this movie in 3d in Mexico based on some video reviews I had seen that said it was an ""experience"" that had to be lived. How far was that from the truth.Love in 3d, which is the title the film had in Mexico, is a tedious, unnecessarily long film that has no real story, statement or message.Its a long porn video with a bad script. The film is supposed to pose a question about what love is, but never really addresses it or takes any kind of position about it. Furthermore, it extends its scenes way past it should. The ending sequences, for example, are just endless quasi-reiterations of the previous scenes that add nothing to the film. You think it is over, and boom! another sex sequence, and then another and another. The ""cuts"" the film uses are also poorly executed. I understand using the cuts for when you jump in time between the scenes but if you do not, why do you still use it? Half of the time the cuts are used, the movie does jump in time,but the other half is just an annoying blink of the screen to come back to exactly the same point.If this had been a 15 minute short then it might actually had made sense, but a 2 and a half hour long movie was definitely way more than a stretch. Save yourself the time and money."
"1630","Love",3,"About as tender as a toilet roll","Having just come back from the UK Premier, I can honestly say, that was quite simply appalling. Only Kill Your Friends is a worse film of 2015.I absolutely loved Enter the Void with a passion, the poster has been my iPhone screen saver ever since. It was slick, stylish, sexy and trippy.Love, however fails to deliver on so many levels. I get what the director was trying to achieve here, but it just doesn't work due to the appalling acting from the very unlikable main character. Where on earth did they get him from? Was he the only actor who was willing to show his erect cock on the cinema screen? His lines are delivered with such a flat misanthropic moribund tone that you can't believe anything he says. The voice over just adds to the car crash. Its a film which lacks any real emotion or chemistry.If you want to watch a gritty film with real emotions watch Blue is the Warmest Colour and 9 Songs. Caspar Noe, you have let us done badly here. Go back to making in your face trippy films."
"1631","Love",2,"Thin plot, bad acting","I guess I fell for the marketing, and I have to admit the idea behind the film still seems OK. The 3D effects were good & not overdone. On the other side: I found the script / plot to be thin, and the acting and voice overs were terrible. I got the idea this was a movie made by an American director who was trying to make a 'european' style movie but didn't succeed. Afterwards I read the director is French (born in south America).The movie lasts more than 2 hours, but there is no suspense, no buildup, etc. Karl Glusman (the lead actor) is not credible in this role, the emotions don't seem real and his voice-overs are even worse. His character begin a 'movie director' or something of the kind seems almost irrelevant and implausible.After an hour, the movie started getting tedious as it was obvious this 'wasn't going anywhere'. I don't recommend seeing it, unless you're only interested in the raw sex in 3D (but remember... it's more than 2 hours you have to sit through)."
"1632","Love",10,"Hottest sex scenes in a film I've seen","Contains some of the hottest sex scenes ever filmed, thanks to the combination of plausible courtship scenes, character development, and graphic (at least partially non-simulated) sex. Many of the sex scenes are beautiful to the point you become aware of the cinematography, though I did not feel aware of the acting at any point. A lot of the melodrama could have been edited out without impacting the plot whatsoever, not to mention some parts that are downright abusive to the viewer with blinding flashing lights, and, I suspect, some cheap abuse of 3D effects (I saw it in 2D), but then again this movie probably couldn't exist without giving the director a ton of editorial freedom. IMHO this is a must-see if you care at all about eroticism in film."
"1633","Love",6,"A marriage made in hell...","... and no I am not talking about the characters in the film, I am talking about what happens when an A-list director ""falls in love"" with the idea of doing a sexually explicit film.I want to be clear about this and I think the data will bear me out. Make a list of all the films in the last 100 years by A-list directors who felt confident they could infringe on territory formerly occupied only by the porn industry and still prevail with a hit film...? Are you done? I will save you time. I did the list myself. And the answer is none, zero, zip, nada.Just like there are in the porn industry a handful of directors who constantly try to push the boundaries of their craft into the mainstream (which almost always means soft light and lots of white sheets, films that most resemble a commercial for TIDE) Noe, a brilliant artiste (Irreversible and Enter the Void were both brilliant) tried to push the envelope .. and ended up with junk mail.Sure, if you are determined to see a silk purse where others are seeing a sow's ear, you could pretend that this film has a great deal to say about men's expectations about love and marriage.But this is a review just between the writer and the reader, and we respect each other too much to lie. So I will be clear -- Noe went where angels fear to tread. And ended up with a film that, for posterity, is simply not going to make his A-reel."
"1634","Love",1,"Pretension","This film is literally a 90 minute porno hiding behind a 2 hour art film. Everything about it is bad. The editing is horrific, every single shot is separated by a half second of a pure black screen. The script is bad. BAAAD. No one has anything resembling a likable personality, there is no plot, the dialogue is stupid at best. The acting... well, these people weren't hired for their acting talent. They were hired because they were willing to get naked and have unsimulated sex on film. This film shows random sex scenes every chance it can. Also it's homophobic and transphobic, there is a scene played totally for laughs where the main guy freaks out over a transgendered woman. OH and if you're an epileptic, avoid this because the director seems to enjoy giving people seizures with random flashing lights.Literally the only thing about this that's in any way well done is the sex, and you can see better sex in actual porn films. Just go rent a porno, you'll get more enjoyment out of it and you won't have to deal with this horribly made 'film'."
"1635","Love",7,"As thought provoking and stylish as you'd expect","As thought provoking and stylish as you'd expect. Kind of like a hybrid of Enter the Void, Nymphomaniac, The Lobster and Weekend. You can feel the love that has gone into this film.The sex is both beautiful and ugly. It's not porn, more like an aestheticized version of somebody's personal sex tape, but one designed to provoke contemplation more than any other response. To feel any more real it would need to be in the style of a documentary, which would have the effect of distancing you from the characters. I didn't feel like I was experiencing the story directly (as I do with good suspense movies), but I did want things to work out well for the characters. If you judge a movie by how much the pacing and suspense immerses you, you won't enjoy Love. If you can be immersed into a movie's atmosphere and want something to feed your imagination, then you will get a lot from it.A lot of reviews and comments on IMDb seem to say it is not a thought provoking movie, or that it is pretentious, yet the poster was moved to write about their thoughts on it, so it certainly isn't empty. I found talking about it can result in the conversation going to some very interesting places.It has earned a place in the history of cinema, and is hopefully a step away from the feelings of shame people feel about sex, a step towards greater freedom in art, culture and cinema."
"1636","Love",6,"Well-made project but ends up tripping over its own interpretation of reality.","Overly ambitious project about a millennial love arc that ends in heartbreak, but what are the lessons learned? Murphy (Karl Glusman) is an open-minded film student in Paris who meets Elektra (Aomi Muyock), and the two embrace their high sex drives with giddyness. However, after the relationship embraces polyamory and swingers culture, only one of the two is emotionally stable enough to handle it.The film is directed really well by Noé, who by now should know well enough how to make it all super claustrophobic and uncomfortable for the viewer. The cinematography is good but relies too heavily on saturation but it's never really an issue. Nonlinear storytelling is clear, concise, and there's some really neat editing at parts. The story does drag often, and the film overall could've cut out 10-15 minutes of filler.The real issue with ""Love"" is the lack of chemistry between Murphy and Elektra -- we just don't see it, pretty much ever. The writing is there, but the actors just cannot grasp it. This is largely because -- are you ready? -- they aren't actors; Noé met both Glusman and Muyock in a club one night and asked them to star. It's clear that he wanted to achieve the most organic and natural relationship dynamic on-screen by not using ""real actors"" -- but in what is supposed to be an emotionally charged film, that just doesn't work.In fact, in a sort of disturbingly surreal manner, the very same issues that the film is trying to highlight in millennial relationships (emotional maturity and boundaries over sex) seem to show up in the unsimulated sex scenes between Glusman and Muyock. Glusman constantly falls out of character, allowing his own sexual desire to ruin the scene and any emotional impact Noé was looking for. Muyock seems bored and uninterested -- and who could blame her? -- likely due to Glusman's obvious zeal about getting paid to fuck her. I'm not sure he entirely understood the fact he was in an art film, and in remaining ignorant, he ends up verifying Noé's entire thesis: young adults, especially men, get lost in the idea of sexual nirvana over the thing that truly matters: love.The second half of the film lifts the veil on Murphy's narcissistic and emotionally abusive behavior in the relationship, and tragically, Glusman is a good actor when portraying an unstable douchebag (and Muyock is phenomenal when screaming at him).The film finishes the same place it starts, seeming to depict Murphy at rock-bottom in a horrible and accidental family dynamic: a fitting bookend to a relationship that was destroyed not by too much sex, but his own fear of it. The ending is eerie and powerful, and hints at the generational ripples that will be felt for decades because of his own actions. It's a great story, and sort of well-acted, but it ends up merely tripping up on its own interpretation of reality instead of offering us anything particularly new."
"1637","Love",NA,"Very Easily misunderstood","Yeah, the sex is uncomfortable to watch, but the fact that it is shown like it is in this movie is not what you end up walking away with if you became emotionally involved in the plot and the characters - the meaning.It illustrates pretty well how destructive uncontrollable sexual urges can be - something that someone magnifying the mere fact of the porno-ness might miss. It's not glamorizing sex. It may look glamorous to you on film, but then you watch the characters suffer horribly for their decisions, destroy their relationships, and their lives.If anything, this movie really illuminates the lesson of ""you don't know what you got till its gone""- you might not realize how much you actually love someone until you've hurt them so much that they never want to see you again, or even drive them to their own destruction, and yours.Good lessons. It's not all about the sex. If you can get past watching people having sex which I'm sure most of the people watching do anyways on the regular, and watch it like there's a message in there somewhere, you might get something out of itOf course the premise at face value sounds like such a sad money grab - but if you've already watched another Noe movie like Enter the Void and are expecting to be moved, there is a similar payoff or take-away"
"1638","Love",7,"Good,Weird,Odd and really different","Well the movie is really different, i felt sad for the main male character with his behavior, the sex scenes are really strong but not from another world, I was not horny, in any sex scene, i just see trying to understand the director point of view, and i hope i did understand this...natural,humans,sex,internet,porn,bisexual and a lot of other things that is happening and will happen in the future, i liked the movie and I did not like, i am giving 7 because the director did a really great job to express the reality of the movie love,behavior,choices and sex. Excellent cinematography, average performance / odd of the actors, good soundtrackof course. My Opinion i am not the master of cinema, but i don't undestard why credential critics give so many bad talk of this movie, i am sure some of they watched/watch porn and/or do sex."
"1639","Love",6,"Um... Conflicted","I don't really know what to think. Would never let myself say this film was bad, it really wasn't in terms of cinematography. But what is good cinematography with a crap story. This is my problem with Noe, if only he could have a good screenwriter, sometimes I think. The style and leaps of time are still very attractive to me. It seems that the whole film is a stream of consciousness of Murphy. But honestly, I hated the female actress for the role, whoever she was, I thought the casting was done very poorly.After watching irreversible, Love was considerably weaker and worse. Again, the use of color was something... remarkable, the editing, the pacing, everything in terms of production were great. But I keep realizing that great production with a bad story does not have much value."
"1640","Love",2,"Let's Face It. It's Porn","Let's face it. Somehow this thing got legitimized by using more expensive film and hi tech movie equipment. I can just see the guys sitting there drooling because this is somehow a mainstream movie. ""Look, dear. This is an art film like the ones you are always talking about. I really don't see anything more than a bunch of explicit sex which I could pick up at any adult movie outlet if I wanted to. Of course, it could have been redeemed if there had been something new about it. The problem is that it is just plain boring. The characters are tiresome and unappealing. The plot is virtually nonexistent. Yes, there is a bit of decent cinematography, but even that is pretentious and ""artsy."" It takes away the simple presentation of the story (such as it is), and when these flashy scenes show up, they are just such obvious eye candy. Don't bother."
"1641","Love",10,"Masterpiece. NOT A PORN FILM FOR F***S SAKE!","How anyone does not regard this as one of the best and most dramatic dramas of 2015 i don't know. (Story) The movie is about the main character dealing with things he did in the past that he can't forget that creates difficulties in the present. As i know, most people are very quick to realize what movies are about and i don't want to spoil this movie so i will jump right into my conclusion.(Conclusion) This movie is one of the best films ever made. I mean that, yes, I've seen citizen Kane, Lawrence of Arabia and shawshank redemption, but this film is still TO ME one of the best films ever made. I have never been so touched and moved of a movies story ever. It has brilliant acting by the main and side characters, even Gaspar Noe himself gives an excellent performance in what he does.The movie maid me cry, this movie maid me come to accept my past in a weird way. Not excuse what i may or may not have done towards the people i love or hate but accept it. This his is how things are and there is no changing that. We wish to go back in time to change it when what we really should focus on is to accept it and learn to live with it. And this movie portrayed that masterfully.Gaspar Noe once again surprises, do not get scared away by the stupid people who only sees penises and nude people. They are just plain and simple short sighted people. This is art on a deeper form. An experience, and if not for the god damn critics who ruined the movie by its ""its just a porn movie"" critic it would have attracted more people. But i see that more people now seem to praise this movie for more than its sex scenes. For its storytelling, visuals, directing, acting.The actors deserve prays, and in my opinion Gaspar Noe (like Lars Von Trier) is once again snubbed for a Oscar win or at least a nomination, just because of people who can't see past penises. I hope everyone watches this movie, and supports REAL art and not just Transformers 10: Resurrection (which has not happen yet but believe me, it will...)Scary days a head in cinema. But nice to see real artists/directors work, even though they are battling a stupid amount of cinema fluff trying to get noticed by their target audience. Real Artist(Screaming)""PLEAS NOTICE REAL ART.... COME ON!!""Studio ex prod(Mockingly)Shh. Shut up.... Turns to director of new movie.Studio ex prod(Respectfully)Yeas Mr. Bay more explosions is exactly what we need..."
"1642","Love",6,"Love, Sex and the Aesthetics of Euphemism","I always have problems with beginnings  the beginning of an article, the beginning of a film, the beginning of a relationship, simply because beginnings are crucial in setting the tone and pattern that will lead you all the way through till the end. Naturally being affected by all the negative social media propaganda that Gaspar Noé's Love (2015) has stirred, I was reluctant to even begin watching it because I am inclined to believe that films with explicit sexual content (except for Lars von Trier's Nymphomaniac, and I will tackle why in another review) are made either to sell like cheap porn for lucrative reasons or to assume a false air of originality and experimentation. I have finally decided to watch Love after it was recommended by a trusted friend of mine, and at the end of the day, one has to constantly push their limits in terms of artistic tolerance.Back to the beginnings, Love begins with a three-minute scene taken in one shot by a steady camera of two people having what seems to be  and what actually turns out to be  unsimulated sex. After overcoming my feelings of discomfort, I started to understand what the Argentinian director is trying to do here. Is it a pornographic scene? It definitely is. But is it meant to be sexually arousing? I would have to argue for a no. Sexual excitement requires a certain amount of build-up, but jumping directly and unexpectedly into the act generates nothing but feelings of shock and unease that would need some time to fade away.The story then unfolds in a backward linear plot. We are introduced to Murphy (the man in the opening sex scene), a frustrated young man who lives in a small apartment in Paris with his detached girlfriend and their son. The memory-evoked reversed narrative is instigated by a voice message he receives from the mother of his ex-girlfriend Electra (the woman from the opening sex scene), asking for his help to find her daughter. The man and the woman from the first sex scene are no longer strangers; we get to see how they broke up, how they managed their relationship, and finally how they met, with a heap of very long unsimulated sex scenes in between.As a voyeur (a person who discreetly watches other people in intimate, usually sexual, positions) I was extremely confused since the enjoyment element was missing. Is it because the sex scenes were too many, too long, too real, or too unnecessary? In one of the scenes Murphy says, as a cunning gesture to voice Gaspar Noé's desire, his biggest dream is to make a movie like no other that truly portrays sentimental sexuality. He also tells Electra: ""I want to make movies out of blood, sperm and tears. This is like the essence of life. I think movies should contain that, perhaps should be made of that."" Well, we see a lot of sperm and tears in that film, there is no doubt about it. It is true Love depicts relationships from an exceptionally crude, raw angle I have never seen before. Sex in cinema  and in life in general  is an uncanny subject; it lies at the essence of everything, everybody knows it is there, yet nobody talks about it overtly.. not in realistic terms at least. The film feels emotionally real. Too real. And not just when it comes to sex, but also to dialogue and performance. In one scene, Murphy tries to get Electra back and he keeps knocking on her door, after a few seconds she opens the door, apparently under the influence of drugs, and screams at him in the most deranged manner you could ever imagine. The camera does not move; it feels like a terrified neighbor watching the scene from the stairs. Most of the camera movement and angles follow the same pattern throughout the movie: the neutral uninvolved medium shot. Mid-film I realized it was not the sex scenes that made me uncomfortable but the fact that the film is devoid of any cinematic, stylistic euphemisms. In conventional romantic films, there is an invisible line separating the romantic from the sexual  love from desire. The subtle message is always: love is sublime and desire is vulgar. The reality of the things, and as presented in the film, is that both are inseparable in their sublimity and vulgarity.I cannot tell for sure whether I like it or not. Cinema, as Slavoj <U+008E>i<U+009E>ek puts it, is ""the ultimate pervert art"" because it does not directly satisfy our desires but manipulates them. It does not show us our capabilities, but give us the illusion that we are capable. Cinema draws the line between imagination and reality and keeps crisscrossing the boundary: it takes imaginary elements and roots them in reality, and sugarcoats real elements in imaginary wraps. The trick is not to call a spade a spade, i.e. not to place two firm feet on one side of the spectrum; otherwise you would shake the balance between reality and imagination that the viewer cannot find in real life.Whatever your sentiments are towards the film, Noé  purposefully or inadvertently  raises some important issues: what if cinema does away with the aesthetics of presentational euphemism? Would it undermine its role as an artistic medium? Would it put the viewer on the defensive, being constantly faced with the unrefined reality of what (s)he dreads/desires?The way I see it is that Noé created an extremely stimulating film, not sexually as he probably desired but intellectually and sentimentally.I'm grateful I watched Love alone and had the chance to struggle with and make sense of all those feelings and thoughts by myself. I can imagine how uncomfortable it would be watching it in a movie theater with other people, let alone how the actors felt while shooting!"
"1643","Love",8,"intense feelings on the big screen","The way they put these deep feelings of love and intense relationship on the screen, is very well done. I can very much relate to a big part of the story. There were maybe too many sex scenes but actually, most of them were very real to me. There could have maybe some more details of the individuals' life (school, work, friends), but at the same time it keeps very much focused on the intensity of the couples relationship, which makes you live their story together with them. The film could have been a bit shorter (cut some sex scenes). But overall, it's a very moving film, it will stay with me for a while. A kind of love like this one is real (I confirm for all the haters out there)!"

"1647","Love",1,"Very explicit but not in the least erotic; worse, it's boring as hell!","""Love"" opens with the kind of sex scene that was once only seen in hard-core porn but which now seems to be the norm in mainstream cinema. Needless to say, if hard-core porn isn't your bag or indeed the films of Gaspar Noe, perhaps it's best you give ""Love"" a miss. Indeed, if you enjoy the pleasures cinema usually offers then I would give ""Love"" a miss too. Noe is, of course, a master of controversy and his films are famous for both explicit sex and violence. They also tend to be visually imaginative but badly written and acted and ""Love"" is no exception, except perhaps that it's even more badly written and acted than most.With a title like ""Love"", of course, you might think the violence level will be minimal and you'd be right but ""Love"" isn't so much concerned with love, (the word is used a tad too often for my liking), but sex and lots of it and in 3D, too. This is a two-and-a-quarter hour porn movie but if it's porn you're after, just ditch this rubbish and stick with the real McCoy. Not that I needed proof, but this sure proves Noe is probably the most overrated director alive."
"1648","Love",4,"love","Well love is defienetly the weakest film made by noe and the worsest thing is that this doesnt feel like a film more like completly porn and soma acid trips thrown in them in few scenes,it is actually hard to belive that this director in past made i stand alone and irreversible and also enter the void that was very fun film to watch,but this one was just out of place in every moment,plot doesnt exist and we are just watching some random people having sex and talking about it,i mean what is point of making films like this one,if i want to watch porn i will go on site for that,they dont need spend a bunch of dollars in making of this when it is same as a cheaper version"

It makes both watching the ""action"" and experiencing what is going through the main character's mind more immersive.I have not seen such a powerful portrayal of a troubled young man since ""Taxi Driver"", one of my favorite movies.""Electra"", the main character's love interest, is also well written and acted. The depth of her character and her flaws are also deeply rooted in the story and its themes.There is a poster of ""Taxi Driver"" hanging on the wall of the room of the main character and I think that ""Love"", like ""Taxi Driver"", has the potential to become a film that will be studied for the ages to come.The 3D was good but I think it could have been slightly better.The only negative aspect that I can think of are that the sex scenes did occasionally become repetitive somewhere halfway, but only sometimes."

"1651","Love",8,"Not at all porn. This movie is a masterpiece","Love ties together all aspects of a relationship and like any failed love it punches you deep in your core. Sex is represented as much more than a physical act. I feel like anyone that has been through an intense relationship ends up completely crushed after this movie, not because it's sad, but because it represents LOVE so well. We are so used to the mainstream presentation of couples in movies and Love completely defies that concept. As with any Gaspar Noe movie, it touches you in a very personal way and leaves you with a nostalgic feeling. 100% recommend this movie. Would not watch it with a significant other or anyone else for that matter. V
Two points deducted for acting and script, not the best, but I don't consider that to be critical. Music is amazing. Great cinematography"
"1652","Love",8,"Most intimate and vibrant","First of all. I'm a huge fan of Gaspar Noé, so my review may be biased somewhat by that. Still, this movie delves into subject matter very unlike Enter the Void, and differs greatly also in its flawless execution. There are many silent moments, as is Gaspar's style, but they aren't empty and vacuous, like in Enter the Void, meant to render in the viewer a sense of aimlessness and confusion, and they're not meant to give you a respite from the vibrant sexuality of the film either. Instead they suffuse exactly the tender sentiment Gaspar was seeking to meld into his project. The film is a tremendous achievement, his somatic style vibrates from the screen and seduces you into the physicality of love. You feel aroused, no doubt, but it's an enveloping arousal, not the two dimensional kind of appeal one would expect from a movie with this caliber of sexuality. No, this is four dimensional; indulgent and honest and raw and desperate and human. The spectacular performances by the relatively unknown actors deliver aching, intimate and haunting sensations. You're there with them. That's the director's touch and it's not easy to achieve. The story is very deep, its foreground tragedies very sharply felt and you're left sad, vulnerable, full of regret and yet also gratitude that you were able to experience love of that magnitude, with all its divine glory and cruelty without actually being stuck in the characters lives. And yet it was a just a movie. And yet it wasn't."
"1653","Love",9,"Love from Gaspar Noe's point of view","Gaspar Noe at his best. I love this film, watched it twice. It takes a lot to make me watch a film twice especially a new released. It's an arty and very well made film about love. It's not always rainbows and butterflies. What I love about Gaspar Noe is he takes risks and experiment with the films. Most of his films are controversial then people start liking it as no one likes a change in the beginning and I love creativity. This film has a very simple plot, simply made with simple acting if you want to watch it expecting some unrealistic cheesy rom com Hollywood commercial film because name of the film is LOVE then this is not for you. Reading people reviews here, repetition of the word ""PORN"" because of unsimulated sex scenes and a lot of sex scenes. There is a good story to the film and the sex scenes compliments with it. I have always been in favour of unsimulated sex as it is one of natural act which every adult goes through. It's about time when people should watch sex scenes without feeling uncomfortable and without the idea that every time you watch unsimulated sex scene you have to play with yourself. I just find it ridiculous, it is just a natural act. Get over it and fix your brain. If people feel uncomfortable with that do some research before you go and watch a film if unsimulated sex makes you feel uncomfortable why did you go on the first place to watch it?A great film !! must watch !!"
"1654","Love",8,"Intimacy as it can be, although not for all","This is definitely not a film that will appeal to all. Some of the scenes are in fact very graphic but what they portray is not porn....For anyone that has lived through some of the scenes in this film it will be very easy to understand why they were included. This film portrays life as it is for some. Those that have not lived these moments will have a very hard time understanding their necessity..This film portrays much of the torment that flows through the minds of those that have been caught up in the intimacy of a profound mental and physical relation that goes beyond the stereotypical roles that contemporary and politically correct society likes to show.The film is dark, full of anguish, torment, fear and pain when confronted with the elation of powerful love and sex.It is a film about emotion, from a darker point of view, it is a film about those on the edge, about real people, living real lives.The director, with an obviously limited budget, has taken a very deep subject and, in my opinion, successfully portrayed the moments and situations which arise through such a period in one's life.This film does not make you smile, it forces you to look at another level of this mortal coil...Not for everyone, as it requires an open mind and a minimum of knowledge of one's feelings and thoughts."
"1655","Love",10,"Amazing, never seen anything like this before","This might be the only movie that shows real intimacy and real love on the screen.It felt like being in someone, listening to him talk to himself. Just like I talk to myself. It felt very satisfying seeing the world trough someone else's eyes. It was very easy to not judge him because i became the head character. I feel it, the feeling of new-love as we say in Sweden. That strong feeling stayed inside me throughout the evening after watching this. That exact feeling you have when everything is crazy and your feelings are so strong. When you can move mountains with the love that fills up your chest. That anything is possible if you just have that other person by your side. And the sex is a very big part of telling this story truthfully."
"1656","Love",9,"Lush, Passionate and Stylish","""If you fall in love,"" says Murphy ""you are a loser."" Only part of him believes this. The other part stalks Electra anywhere she goes. She is the source of both intense passion and pain for Murphy. Into the night clubs of Paris with their pulsing lights and vibrant colors, alleys, subways, bedrooms and showers (especially these last two), we follow the young couple. The film moves back and forth in time and is about the joy and sadness of being in love. Love is intimate in two senses of word. In one sense the sex is raw and explicit (3D explicit) and in the second sense the film really puts viewers into the scenes. It is as if we are really involved in the film. This is the characteristic style of the director. It is bold, stylish, playful, intense, non-linear and extremely passionate. Noe makes appearances in many of the scenes in one form or another (when Murphy named his kid ""Gaspar,"" many in the audience chuckled). Even the ending credits are stylish in terms of visuals and sound, and you can't stop watching even that. Noe really has the ability and courage to show such lushness in emotions and scenery. The cinematography is not as good as Enter the Void, nor is the acting, yet it isn't too far removed. Five of five stars. Seen at the Toronto International Film Festival 2015."
"1657","Love",9,"A Masterpiece by Gasoer Noe","The Story's baseline is - "" LUST could destroy your life , it could harm the people around you , the people you LOVE the most & most importantly YOU .""Just a timely desire can cost you all your happiness and you won't be able to gain it back again !The direction is superb , most RAW ,straightforward and to the point and the story/script is the key element of the movie and very beautifully narrated by Gasper Noe. #kudosP.S. I feel sad for the people who didn't get the essence of the script and just watched it like a low graded movie."
"1658","Love",8,"things fall apart","So it is when distinctions break down. when sex is confused for love and vice versa. when the ephemeral feels like the eternal. when self destruction becomes tantamount to pleasure and hedonism drives rather than informs the meaning of life. it is then and there that the past becomes oblivion and the future a pipe dream. it is typical of Gaspar Noe to bend, break, warp, and reshuffle time in his movies. he takes great reverie in it. it is something worth noting. here Noe takes an essentially pornographic film and attempts to infuse it with raw emotion, think Linklater's Before Sunrise or even more Charlie Kaufman's Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind. he does not exactly succeed for the task is impossible, but nor does he fail entirely. what must be noted or at least noticed is the lack of a future. for all the pretenses of love, for all the sexual encounters between an array of adults there is but one child in the whole movie. dozens of purported adults screwing each other into their graves and only one child to inherit a very lonely future. so it is with hedonism. so it is when you've lost distinctions between words, and meanings become meaningless. your life, your love, your existence, your home, your nation are too rendered meaninglessthe breakdown of time becomes palpable beyond the mere characters on screen. where is this Paris that they are at? does it have a past? you'd never tell from this film, and so it doesn't. without a past it must certainly relinquish it's future. again one lonely child. while i can love this movie and admire it's artistry and what it attempts to do, it must not be confused for art nor beauty. it's lyricism is that of an epitaph for a civilization. it's ugliness like ruins, a warning for the hordes who may inherit what they cannot fathom.8/10"
"1659","Love",10,"Touching, beautiful and real","I stumbled upon this movie on Pornhub :) and after the first minute realized what a gem I found! After ""Irreversible"" I vowed to myself to never watch another Gaspar Noé movie, - graphic violence towards women is not something I enjoy looking at. All the more reason to be surprised at how moving, tender and beautiful this film turned out to be. Why such outrage in the reviews is beyond my understanding, - is the sight of two (or three:) people making love is that offensive? Are these people plan on never having sex? Obviously they never seen any porn, if they calling this movie porn! ""Love"" is a meditation on physical intimacy, with beautiful cinematography, mesmerizing soundtrack and hypnotic performance by Aomi Muyock, that is certainly worth watching and does not deserve the low rating it has on IMDB. I personally was really touched by the use of Erik Satie's ""Gnossiennes"" throughout the film, as it's one of my favorite pieces of music, and I always felt there's a flair of understated sensuality about them. Please forgive my grammar errors, English is not my native language."
"1660","Love",10,"Show me how gentle you can be","One of the greatest movies of all time! After ""Irreversible"" and ""Enter the Void"", I thought director Gaspar Noe would have reached his peak. I thought either that, or maybe he would have nothing left to show, but this movie satisfies what the characters in the movie are looking for. Towards the end of the movie, one character bemoans the complete absence of ""sentimental sexuality"" in cinema, and proposes to supply it, and earlier, one of the characters challenges another: ""Show me how gentle you can be."" This movie is Noe's offering to that challenge. This movie continues in the recent history of French movies that seem to keep erasing the boundary between pornography and art. And yet this movie seems to be one of a kind, thanks to how personal and vulnerable it seems. It seems to be a magnum opus, as do all of Noe's works. That's part of what makes them so thrilling to watch: they all have a distinct spirit of desperation infused in them, a hunger to be great. This movie seems to be ground-breaking in its camera-work, in its story structure, in its handling of nudity and sex. And it's very beautiful. It soars where the latest movies of many formerly great auteurs seem to strain and miss. The cinematography and editing are top-rate, and there are no more devoted actors than these. The soundtrack alone deserves to have a substantial essay written on it, the way it sounds 80s yet contemporary yet futuristic, the way it sounds menacing yet romantic yet hip and yet like the soundtrack to a porno. Perfection!"
"1661","Love",1,"BORING!","If I could give negative stars I would. This movie was BORING!"
"1662","Love",9,"Cant believe a master piece like this has such low rating","People who have given low rating do not understand cinema. I literally watched this movie 3 times in past 2 days. Its beautifully shot and narrated, I especially loved how the chronology connects to the story line. If you really want to enjoy the film and understand it and savour it, then quit doing everything else, and just watch the movie."
"1663","Love",4,"Meandering, Repetitive, Self-indulgent & Lacking in Substance","The movie keeps repeating scenes and scenes of rumination and sex, as if the director was trying to fill up two hours, or thought he had created some new pure cinema art form. It really gets tiring and sickening. Like the repeated shots of male ejaculation, one gets the feeling that the director was too cocksure of what he thought he was achieving, thus overindulging it to the extreme."
"1664","Love",10,"Brave, Sultry, Feeling-Oriented Filmmaking","Both effective and affecting, Gaspar Noe's ""Love"" (2015 France) will make you FEEL... intensely, albeit emotionally ambiguous, at times. This is a sensual (not suitable, at all, for young audiences), heartbreaking, histrionic piece, the final minutes, of which, have haunted me/saddened me/enlightened me throughout today. Critics and most audiences will not accept or understand this film (read: which means it's good), but I think this is honest, visually- succinct/dreamy, brave, and aware filmmaking. There are no rules here... socially or personally. I actually woke up today with the final line of this picture wooing me awake... and it kind of hurt, in a life-affirming way. Excellent film."
"1665","Love",9,"watch it at *1.5 speed","Art film, so as usual, very slow but increase the speed.Voila!!"
"1666","Love",9,"Wish there more mainstream films like Love","From the opening scene, Love is provocative, arousing, and realistically sensual. I wish there were more films with full male and female nudity like this one. Unlike X rated films that depersonalize sex, I became totally absorbed with the humanness of the opening scene. Far from being offensive - the mutual touching is real, relatable and passionate. As a male, you totally relate to the intensity of the moment. The complexity of Karl Glusman's past relationship makes the plot interesting and sexually intriguing. This is one that I will love to watch again."
"1667","Love",10,"I really liked this film","First of all,the cinematography is excellent, loved the passionate colors, sex scenes are interesting to watch, I don't think this was porn, this is a love story, love every movie Gaspar Noe makes, good for him"
"1668","Love",8,"A realistic journey into discovering what love means","A movie that does not compromise with the stereotypical sinematic demonstrations around sex and manages to show us what love and relationship really means.It is difficult for a movie to have so many sex scenes and not be lecherous,but the directros have done it,telling us that sex is also romantic.The couple goes through many emotional fluctuations like happiness,hate,anger,sadness,jealousy throughout the movie, showing us the many sides of love and what a compicated and wild,but in the same time beautiful sentiment is.The raw sex scenes and the chats between the two characters are very realistic and makes us think of our moments with our lovers.When the movie comes to an end i believe every viewer will ask himself:
What is love finally?"
"1669","Love",9,"Fantastic cinema","I understand that my comments will come off as condescending but the reality is that after reading the negative user reviews, it is obvious that the people who failed to enjoy the film are not sophisticated film enthusiasts and likely just watched because they were looking for great sex scenes. There is so much more substance to ""Love"" than sex. It is a film about complex human personalities, regret, consequences and most importantly, the complexity of human emotions and impulses. I know from the first few scenes that Elektra was a damaged person. Noe did such a fantastic job of getting the very best out of talent with limited experience. Perhaps that was the magic. A group of people who wanted to tell a story and didn't come to the project with baggage or egos. If you enjoy human stories and you are not uptight about the dark nature of the mind, ""Love"" is a must see."
"1670","Love",3,"Dangerous Liaisons it ain't !","I think the director is really a frustrated porn aficionado but hasn't got the guts to ply his trade in the San Fernando Valley. Instead he wants to dress it up as a deep, introspective art form but he's a not a good enough director to pull that off.This is porn for all those who think they're above that sort of thing. The sheer length of the sex scenes (way beyond what is necessary to establish the feeble gist of what scant plot there is) tells you all you need to know.A CCTV camera in a college dormitory would produce a better film.Having said that, the filming and lighting is good for the most part so kudos to the technical team."
"1671","Love",1,"Childish and Boring","Gaspar should go study both Nymphomaniac films by Lars von Trier. Von Trier managed to keep his audience interested for two feature films' worth, yet I couldn't get halfway though this...mistake.The script was 7 pages long for a feature film, and it really shows. The two female stars weren't actors, but picked up by Goe at parties (""beautiful people""). Beautiful doesn't mean compelling or deep or interesting and they aren't. The all too real sex is kind of creepy, as they seem like children playing at it. For real sex, they are very disengaged. No one climaxes, no one ever breathes hard, except the guy, who gets too wrapped up in his sexual goals. Thus, there is a good reason, beyond the obvious. why sex should be acted, although I've seen much better in amateur porn vids. People who I would gladly watch a movie about afterwards. But these people...no. I was more irritated by them than anything and the terrible acting and many voice overs didn't help.If not for the sex, this film would have been lost to obscurity and thought of as Goe's unfortunate career moment. Real sex in film is not an oddity, there are millions upon millions of porn films and videos on the internet, so I'm not sure why Goe, some viewers, and some of his peers in the film industry think this is so precious and artful. What is artful about setting a camera and telling your ""actors"" to have sex? Maybe he should have told them to act like they care."
"1672","Love",7,"you should see this... to remember the potential of the art of cinema","Although Gaspar Noé claims this movie is a love story in the perspective of sex, i felt vice versa. Sex which is crafted beautifully and bravely is more dominant and attractive througout the film. The way love is written, however, is one of the worst amid the romance movies: shallow, basic, dull. I personally felt that if we took out the sex which became a routine from the life of the couple, there would be no relation anymore, they'd completely divide as if they were binded by only sexual feelings. Acting sucks too. I wish it took an hour less which must suffice to present what , i think, is aimed.
On the other hand, I anyway enjoyed a lot to witness rare explicit piece of photographic art. What is dared and produced is going to remind itself to me for long years even if we do not come across again."
"1673","Love",8,"TWENTY ONE PLUS.","It's sexy, often beautiful, often true, and a little plodding. A non linear plot gives u a confusing timeline. The acting, particularly that of Glusman as Murphy, is decent. But I'm guessing it's a challenge getting first-rate actors to perform real sex on film. I wonder what's the difference between this film and porn?"
"1674","Love",9,"Magic lantern of love and sex","A boy wakes up with his wife and son and arrives the phone call of the mother of the ex-girlfriend, Elettra, whose tracks have been lost.A journey through erotic scenes with different angles of lights of different colors from different light sources and with different shades : excellent and innovative direction of photography of Benoit Debie that emphasizes the direction of Gaspar Noè with a psychedelic and delicate music. A jerky and jump cut editing takes the viewer into a magic lantern of love and sex, like the cinema dreamed of by the protagonist that reflects the fundamentals of the cinema of Gaspar Noè. In the first meeting, before unruliness, Murphy and Elettra speak of love as a vital and luminous essence that leads to madness. They promise to protect each other but fall into the abyss of drugs and betrayals. Murphy even when Elettra has disappeared, he imagines her with him and begs God to want to return to their first night. Unlike ""Enter the void"" it is a psychedelic journey not after death but in a vital past whose memory brings alive a dead present.
This film is not a minor tragedy of Euripides' Elettra. It is not a minor tragedy to meet up with a woman who does not love and to live memories of love from the past."
"1675","Love",7,"Maybe a life related problem story for married person","A love story for restricted Under 14.this is kinda life related problem story.many people got with someone whomsoever he doesn't love.moreover they take baby.but still cannot forget real lover.then there is starting confliction between reality and inner feelings.kind of conflict which is not easy to solve.suffer tremendous pain.cannot forget their past let alone live happily in present. this movie told what is goes in mind when someone fall in this kind of situation. There is some adult scene which can allure you.high level sedution ...everything is good about this film"
"1676","Love",NA,"'Love' by Gaspar Noe is a warning","'Love' by Gaspar Noe doesn't show what love is and still it is about love. In fact, it is a strong warning. A young girl and a young man know that they love each other and promise to care for each other but what they do destroys them and damages their love. Electra wants to commit suicide (and might have done it), Murphy is lost and doesn't know what to do. There are no more them as they were when they met but their love is - wrecked, twisted, unable to shine it lives in their hearts and in their memories.There's a scene in which Murphy says that what he would like is sex with love. He knows the difference between casual sex and loving.Erotic scenes though too abundant in the film are beautiful. Finally the young couple realizes that they do harm to each other by satisfying his or her crazy wishes and decide to stay apart for some time. What about their love? Do they care for it? Nothing of the kind. Each of them cares for oneself having sex or drugs nonchalantly. Love lost its home. Surprisingly enough but a truly loving relationship makes a triangle: you, me and Love. Is that the message of Gaspar Noe?"
"1677","Love",3,"Artistic erotica","As an erotic film, ticks all the boxes. The cinematography is vivid, However, the storyline is all over the place, the acting is lifeless, and the scene changes jarring."
"1678","Love",1,"Bad movie","Such a time waste movie. Sex cannot make any movie a hit, it should have a story. I didn't like the hero aswell. Total time waste."
"1679","Love",3,"Way too much sex","There's so much sex that it starts to distract from the plot. I wanted to know what happened to Electra but midway I stopped caring when the relationship became sexual napalm."
"1680","Love",6,"What's average for Noe is still an unreachable standard for most directors.","Why the low rating? because in truth, 'Love' isn't nearly as impactful as it would like to be . By the time the second acts opens, you're entirely desensitised from the (real, unsimulated) portrayal of sex.The best scenes are lifted straight out of 'enter the void' and the low budget really hurts the not-so-great ones. By the times the credit roll in typical GN fashion, you'll be regretting this wasn't more akin to 'I stand alone'. I certainly did. Like many others said, the plot is this film's greatest weakness, and it goes to show that even one of the best directors on earth is unable to salvage a weak narrative."
"1681","Love",8,"Beautiful","Even though the acting could be better, it is a very nice movie to watch.
Sex through deep love is just beautiful.
Worth to watch."
"1682","Love",5,"Mostly disappointing","The dissection of relationships is a wellknown theme for films but this is not a good one - the main problem is the protagonist, Murphy (played by a rather bland Karl Glusman) who is, self-admittedly, only good at destroying things. It's simply neither nice nor captivating to watch a bunch of self-destructive people do their destructing, and it's also far from enlightening or enriching. Basically it's more than two hours of painful watching without any levity; the only touching scenes are the sex scenes which are really well done, far from any porn aesthetics but beautiful and the only sequences where the characters seem to enjoy themselves. Which was maybe the point but doesn't carry the story far enough to make it interesting.
The camerawork doesn't help - mostly very severe central perspectives and neatly composed still images, very much like a Wes Anderson film, but without the humour.
The music was very good, a rather eclectic mix but well chosen - along with the sex scenes, this is what saves 'Love' from being a pure disaster. Still, after the terrific 'Enter the Void' I can't feel but pretty disappointed with 'Love'.Parental advice: The characters use rather violent language in some scenes, shouting at each other and there's even face-slaps, so you might consider leaving the kids at home for this one."
"1683","Love",1,"It is incorrectly titled","There is love. There are good .rooming people, sex, yelling, abuse,ranting and swearing, but no love. The flimsy story is used to promote abortion and infidelity, selfishness and meanness. The actors are used to advance classic leftist notions like if you eat meat you should support aborting babies. This a very dull lecture interspersed with unnecessary but well filmed sex."
"1684","Love",1,"I didn't watch the whole movie, but what I saw was crap.","Was this movie made for gays and women only? Love is one of the worst ever, if not the worst, for the DOUBLE STANDARD against men. If you read the"" view content advisory"" Here is what you will read. From the opening frame, there are several graphic sex scenes with lots of nudity.Female nudity; breasts, bottoms, and pubic hair are often shown, however there are no direct views of the vulva/vagina. Male nudity; full frontal and quite often very explicit.The film graphically deals with a past love affair that lasted for two years and saw the two main characters engage in all sorts of casual and less casual sexual practices, including an attempted threesome with a transgender person. Many of these practices are shown in graphic detail.All the sex is un-simulated (meaning the sex is really happening).In one scene two females and one male engage in a threesome.An erect penis is shown many times throughout the film.Two or three times an ejaculation is shown, including one scene where a woman's hand is scene masturbating an erect male penis (which is the only thing on screen), before the male ejaculates directly at the camera lens.Quite a lot of sexually-related talks throughout.So what could possibly be the reason for this except that it was made for gay men and straight women. The Double Standard is alive and well, even in NC-17 and NR and unrated movies.If anyone has a clue as to why it was done this way, please respond."
"1685","Love",1,"Lust","I haven not seen many of Gaspar Noe's films but I think he's a good director. Irreversible is the best one I've seen from him so far. This movie on the other hand had no meaning and no heart. Maybe it's because I'm fifteen and I don't know what love is but in my opinion this is the complete opposite of love. Disgusting."
"1686","Love",NA,"Ugh","Really, really terrible. Long and boring, the main characters (most notably Murphy) were all terrible people, and there's horribly disgusting transphobia in it."
"1687","Love",5,"Memories, regrets and lots of sex","Greetings again from the darkness. It's what would normally be categorized as a cold opening, but somehow the term doesn't seem to fit the beginning of director Gaspar Noe's daring new film. A beautifully lighted, static camera opening shot lasts for a few minutes. It's startling in that the two people on screen are immersed in mutual manual stimulation in what has to be the most explicit and abrupt opening shot in film history. Red flags are waving <U+0085> Mr. Noe's exploration of love has little to do with meet-cute or Hollywood romance. Instead, he dives into the harsh realities of growing emotionally close to someone, and then having it crumble <U+0085> leaving only memories and regrets.Directly from that opening, we shoot ahead two years. Murphy (Karl Glusman) is now in bed with a different woman. A baby cries from another room. He goes to comfort the child as we get our first exposure to his inner-voice <U+0085> he feels trapped and beaten down. There is obvious tension between Murphy and Omi (Klara Kristen) as she takes the child and he listens to a voice mail. It's a frantic plea from the mother of his ex-girlfriend (we of course know it must be the one he/we became so intimate with in the opening). Electra (Aomi Muyock) has not been heard from in a couple of months, and suicide is a real concern.This voice mail triggers an onslaught of memories for Murphy, and it becomes clear Electra was the love of his life. The memories are fired at us in the way memories do <U+0085> sometimes quick, sometimes drawn out, and in a haphazard order that requires much assembly. We see Murphy's and Electra's good times and bad, understand how they mostly communicated through sex, and witness the turning point in their relationship  they invite their bright-eyed new neighbor into their bed. Just like Murphy, you may initially think Europeans are so cool and advanced to avoid the petty jealousies and fidelities that Americans so value. However, the cool bubble pops quickly when in the blink of a faulty condom, the love of one's life is gone and the morning is soon filled with the cries of a baby.Much of the above is about the story and the characters; however, it would be an injustice to remain quiet on the unusual amount of sex <U+0085> explicit sex acts <U+0085> shown throughout the film. Director Noe (Enter the Void, Irresistible) has always been cutting edge, but a 3D sex-filled movie is pushing boundaries for most any movie viewer. It's artfully filmed and presented, so the only thing it shares with porn is the explicit sex. It reminds of the Burt Reynolds character in Boogie Nights, whose dream was to make an artful mainstream porn movie. Perhaps that is what Mr. Noe has accomplished.However one decides to label the film, it's a no-holds-barred look at the stages of love and how it can go bad so quickly. It's also an expose' on the lack of emotional maturity of so many men (especially American) who somehow think ""protecting"" each other is a key relationship step. Murphy has one scene where he begs Electra to save them from his poor judgment, and another where he says ""sometimes it's better not to lie"". There is also a theme of French vs Americans, with an emphasis on American's propensity for war/violence and possession, rather than freedom. It's difficult to say if audiences are ready for Noe's latest, but it's clear he has something to say <U+0085> and plenty to show."
"1688","Love",6,"What is Love?","While I didn't try to think of the song, the line ""Baby don't hurt me ... don't hurt me no more"" came to mind. And it's not like it doesn't suit or fit with the movie (if you excuse the pun). And let's get this out of the way straight ahead: If you didn't or don't already know, this movie has scenes of explicit sex in it. And it begins with a masturbation scene, to shock you right out of the gate (or those who will be offended by it of course).It goes without saying that this is full of nudity. You may not have seen this actors before, but you'll see everything of them in this. It's not only being naked physically, but also mentally. Laying emotions out there and going through motions (literally and metaphorically) is draining. Both for the actors and the viewers. The story is simple. It's about love or the idea of it.Which brings us back to our initial question. Are we able to appreciate what we have? Or do we long for things we can't have? Can we be happy with the person we spend our time or is the temptation for something new too big? Obviously that depends on the individual and their ""world"" view. Also their emotional state. The movie is as you can tell not an easy watch ... for multiple reasons. The message is clear though ..."
"1689","Love",9,"Beautifully done","Now most people will not like this movie and I totally get it. I am fortunate enough to have seen it in 3D which I truly enjoyed dodging seaman was quite interesting. But for me this movie was excellent. The cast and acting was absolutely delicious. Like the Noe films I've seen, there are some great artistic shots and uncomfortable moments but I went in with those expectations and part of the joy is seeing how much you can endure watching. For me, what really caught my attention was the lead actor's emotional acting around heartbreak and regret, I know that feeling and I can almost feel his pain...the sex scenes become secondary after a while if you can find yourself connecting to the emotions of the story...and if you've watched enough unsimulated sex in film as I have, it actually isn't quite a big deal. I think Noe did make it his purpose to oversexualize the film a bit which at some points I found unnecessary but all and all, excellent film and just as good if not better then Irreversible"
"1690","Love",5,"Love is more than what you see here","By the reviews that I've read on this page and others calling it just porn, I assume the movie had literally just sex. I was surprised to see that the even though the sex scenes are long, it's definitely not the whole movie, neither it feels like porn. The problem relays in the fact that I've seen porn with more content than this. More artistic, better edited. That should give you an idea of what type of film this is. The protagonist is insufferable. I hated him 5 minutes into the film. And we don't get to know the rest of the characters either, in consequence, you don't really care what happens to them. The performances are mediocre. At times it truly feels like an amateur project. The shots get repetitive and boring and the dialogues fall flat. This a good idea, let's show a relationship from a sexual point of view without censoring. I appreciated that but where's the real intimacy, the real feeling. I have no idea. Nymphomaniac did it. I haven't met anyone who has seen that movie and hasn't feel overwhelmed. There's emotion, pain, struggle. The main topic, of course, is different, but I think you get the point. Love is more than what you see here. Actually, love shouldn't be what you see here."
"1691","Love",7,"Love is Possession","Love is kind of an exhausting film to watch, but based on how the film is shot and edited, I understand that that's probably its intention.I came out of this film feeling that Love is not the idealistic thing it is made out to be. It's visceral, primal, disgusting, and somewhat like an illness. So much of this film is shot and edited so starkly that the sex scenes, especially, are exceptionally uncomfortable and bordering on repulsive to watch.Coming away from this film, it was very clear to me that this is offering criticism of the quality of millennial relationships. As youth are bound to be, this film shows how sex-obssessed young people can be but juxtaposes it with the failure of experimentation with polyamory which I found really added color and an interesting dynamic to its commentary. There's this obsession with sex and being open to the same kind of free love that existed in the hippie counter culture of the American 1960s, but millennials aren't hippies and still idealize monogamous relationships - making the celebration of free expression of sexuality to be incredibly difficult, if not, impossible.Love had me thinking but it's not a film I would recommend to the casual moviegoer or for those who aren't into the more artistic, independent side of film making.I respect this film for what it has to say as there is more to this film than what I mentioned, which gives it great thematic depth, but I can't say I want to see it again any time soon."
"1692","Love",6,"This film is an interesting journey","This film is an interesting journey... though the writing and acting felt sometimes a bit weak and cheesy and some sexual scenes were long and disturbing.. loved the cinematography."
"1693","Love",6,"Weakest Noe movie","Lighting, editing, sound, soundtracks are great as in any of Noe's movies. But story is very weak and shallow and the male actor is the most talentless actor I ever watched."
"1694","Love",5,"You won't forget this one","This has gotta be one of the most 'sex-filled' films ever made. Very graphic, full frontal scenes. I mean, you see EVERYTHING! Even the 'money shot' barf...It's basically an arted up porno. The characters are not likeable and you kinda feel like they bring everything on themselves. It's hard to feel sorry for them in certain situations. But it's so crazy and out there that you can't really stop watching. Will definitely stay with me for a while.If you do like this kind of art porn, watch the movies Nymphomanic Vol 1 & 2. They were more entertaining."
"1695","Love",6,"If you missed the plot and story line it's because you are too conservative for this film","I see a lot of people saying there was no story line or plot. I believe they may have been so shocked by the graphic sex scenes that they failed to pay attention to the rest of the movie, There is very much a plot and also a life lesson.'6.1"
"1696","Love",1,"Categorized as Romance/Drama, But Actually a Sexist Porn","This is simply a porn film, with the exception that rather large and thick merkins (huge wigs for the genitals) are used on ALL the WOMEN to ensure that while you see lots of male genitalia engorged with blood being rubbed, sucked, and ejaculated onto the women's hands...there will be ZERO female genitalia. In instances where the wig cannot cover, the usual tricks of head, hand, shoulder and camera angle are used. Since this is essentially a XXX movie, I have no idea why they insisted upon not showing any female genitalia. I guess it is just that the French movie makers are just as sexist as those in the USA. Whether that sexism is driven by a the old fashioned belief that women's genitals are GROSS (which they aren't) or that women should have sexual privacy that men don't deserve. Or something else."
"1697","Love",8,"Love porn with depth","Gaspar Noe is a legend. He succeeded to make a porn movie and show it at the Cannes festival. Good story, has its depth and touches the essence, great camera, directing, actors and a sickly good soundtrack. But in the end, it's still porn. Love porn. I love it.8/10"
"1698","Love",7,"extreme sex scene's","The third full feature released by the notorious director Gaspar Noé. This flick should have been his first full feature but Monica Bellucci and others turned down the offer. they have seen the script and were okay with it but once they were told it would go rather explicit they declined the offer. And in came Noé's first flick Irréversible (2002). Monica did have to go full frontal but it never became nudity and sex on the edge of porn. Stiil the flick was controversial due the 9 minute rape scene and the fire extinguisher scene. Next came Enter The Void (2009) but Gaspar still wanted to make Love. No actress wanted to go that far so he went out to clubs to find girls willing to make a movie with explicit sex scene's. Never telling them it was for the main lead he finally found 2 girls and finally Love was shot.Of course it's Gaspar, so you know it will be a long and slow flick with arty shots just like in Enter The Void and that's exactly what we get here. But this time people could be offended by the nudity. The first minute it's already a girl jerking off a guy. in front of the camera without restrictions. Is it art or porn, that became the issue of this flick. The main male lead (Karl Glusman) is known for Starship Troopers Invasion (2012) and Neon Demon (2016). He told papers that there wasn't any stand-in for his hard on or for the sex scene's. No tricks no effects, the real stuff. The story tells us a bit that the grass isn't always greener on the other side. Murphy (Glusman) and Electra (Aomi Muyock) are a perfect couple but want to have a threesome with their neighbour, a seventeen year old girl. When Electra is out for a weekend Murphy and the seventeen year one have sex but the condom broke. She gets pregnant but she's never the love of his life, Electra is. And when he got a phone call from Electra's mother that she disappeared we do get to see what went wrong and go deeper into the characters. So it's about their characters and their sex lives. As I said before, it's explicit with cum shots, blow jobs, jerking off , fist f*cking and entering sex clubs to the extreme and even a transgender still being a boy but also having huge juggs. But the discussion if it's porn or not, I say not because the intercourse or genitals are never shown...It clocks in over 2 hours, maybe a bit too long. But it's Gaspar so you know what you will get. Extreme shots, long conversations and no hold barred on every count. My only question is, can he go more shocking after this one? Not for everybody but that's typically Gaspar.Gore 0/5 Nudity 4/5 Effects 0/5 Story 3/5 Comedy 0/5"
"1699","Love",8,"For the benefit of sexual revolution!","About to speak of the film where widescreen nearly-pornography is rendered absolute, I prime you beforehand there will be no sentimentality in my review - I'll speak straight from the shoulder.So, hail the sexual revolution, as it was said by the Swedish Eurodance band 'Army of Lovers' in the 90s; these and similar musicians, so glamorous and possessing springness ('Mr. President', 'E-Rotic', 'T-Spoon', etc), rejecting the centuries-old dogmata, sang rollicking songs about Coco Jamboo, Dr. Dick and Sex on the Beach. DOGmata were thrown to the DOGS, even though the church didn't experience times of adversity in the West, unlike in our country, in long-suffering Russia; and in the world of popmusic, that happened a couple of decades sooner than in cinema, and let me express my view, why. Many are too timid to visit spicy film shows: imagine your stiff school mistress going to some tear-jerker and, by chance, seeing you entering another showing room with an exciting female bum on poster! But as for dance floors, there's hardly anyone but youth, and they haven't had dubious glances on themselves in ages. A pop band plays free-and-easy hits; everybody sexually hunts everyone; and what causes that small culpable circle to move, are ecstasy Disco Biscuits. But even before the disco time, time of messing about, the sexual revolution won in terms of clothes! 40-45 years ago, even for those times, and even in Russia, it was unlikely that anyone, except old grannies in their senility maybe, would be outraged at wearing short dress or a miniskirt by a young girl. Because all sane people understood: the majority wore shorts and mini not because they were sexually driven and preoccupied with sex. Girls feel HOT but it has nothing to do with being HOT, it's just summer weather! All in all, after comparative equality of men and women had come and condoms as well as birth control pills had flooded the market of everyday goods, sexual revolution began to advance with giant strides, no doubt about it. As a result, the present is full of TV music videos with blue subjects like cherries with cream, passionate glances and sighs, and satin female bare feet; what is the most popular book, is an erotic novel ('Fifty Shades of Grey'), which has beat even 'Harry Potter', 'Twilight' and 'The Lord of the Rings'. Thanks to the marvellous success of the bestseller #1, the film of the same name showed box office running into $ half a billion. All the rest films of 'free-and-easy' content still fail in business, but that's certainly not because they are not desirable; people are just still too shy to visit such showings, concerned about being caught by those acquaintances who consider the word 'sex' to be a synonym for 'lechery'...At that, all the hypocrisy around having sex is due to nothing more than the fact that sex organs, by some natural reasons, perform excretion functions as well... That's the only thing these organs came in for their 'ill fame'; but if they weren't connected with excretion in any way, no-one, I'm quite sure, would ever think about sex blameworthily! And the words literally (with neither biological terminology nor euphemistic connotation) nominating these organs and what they do - would never be considered 'dirty'!But it's high time to give up speculating about 'what would be if pigs had wings'; they would be angels, huh; if is a big word. Here comes 'Love' by Gaspar Noé. First of all, I can't but express my indignation at the virtual ban of it with us in Russia! It was shown officially just once, in Saint Petersburg, with some well-known oppositionists attending the showing. This dismisses the suggestions adduced in my reviews of the films 'Pouta' (Czech Republic) and 'Pouhdistus' (Finland): I said they were not 'banned', just ignored by Russian distributors on the grounds of unprofitability... I should have had not high opinion of our powers that be! I should have known that market laws wouldn't work any longer if politics intervenes in various branches of life!But what I'm still convinced of, is that it's public opinion in Russia that allows these people rule! It was curious for me to look through the 'Love' reviews posted by Russians! There were of course a couple of odd opinions. A religionist lamented his bitter fate: he was unable to drop the filmmakers in hell pan. A young woman lapsed into daydreams of her bygone love. But by and large, the prevailing public opinion can be reduced to: 'this is not the film we in Russia are in need of'; the whole globalising world doesn't keep in step - our beloved Russia is the only one who keeps in step. (Such a wild sentiment is just perfect for the current regime.) Some extolled Noé's talents to the skies and tried to find a black cat in a dark room, but there was no cat. Very few reviewers treated the film impartially. Namely, as just a film with mission to show that the civilisation (not Russia, though, I'm sorry to inform you!) has latched onto a fine art house film with sex as the lion's share of runtime! The box office is low, extremely low in comparison with 'Fifty Shades', but art house films are always getting next to nothing in comparison with blockbusters, not much of eyeopener! A 3D art house, are you kidding?! That Noé sure wanted to snatch a large sum. That you would probably ask me. And I'd answer: 3D here is not a blockbuster attribute, just a ground-breaking technical spec: the 'first 3D nearly-pornographic mainstream' status makes 'Love' a pioneering film!"
"1700","Love",NA,"Memories fade and blur over time","Distressed and guilt-ridden upon learning that his former girlfriend has mysteriously vanished, an aspiring filmmaker loses himself in his faded memories in this characteristically graphic motion picture experience from the mind of Gaspar Noé. With his thoughts narrated aloud and intimate camera-work that constantly follows the protagonist around, the film captures the upset young man's stream of consciousness well. The non-linear nature of his flashbacks comes also across as an accurate reflection of the recollection process. Clocking in at nearly two and a half hours long though, the film runs incredibly long for a movie with such a relatively simple premise and bits and pieces grow repetitive quite quickly. Oddly enough, it is the sexually charged scenes that feel the most repetitive despite Noé constantly upping the ante with how explicit the scenes are; on the other hand, it is logical that the dialogue-heavy scenes come off better since those are the ones in which we actually see the characters interacting and learn progressively more about them. In fact, the bigger question is probably why the protagonist so often thinks of copulation when remembering his ex-girlfriend; are these the moments when he felt most intimate with her, and if they are, is he confusing love with lust? It is surely food for thought. Whatever the case, 'Love' leaves an indelible impression that is hard to shake. It is not as immersing and overwhelming an experience as 'Enter the Void', but it does a fairly decent job of handling a similarly dreamy narrative structure in which time seems to blur."
"1701","Love",2,"Love this film.....NOT","Just now watching this film as it has come to Netflix. I have heard about this film from different resources saying that it was a hot title to watch on Netflix. I figured I would check it out, even though I had never heard about it before. I was warned that the sex scenes in the movie were quite graphic, which they are, and I am afraid that those scenes are all this film has to offer.
The premise is weak. The writing is horrible , and even the sex scenes lack passion. The best thing going for this movie is the cinematography is pretty good. That is about it.
I find it hard to imagine that someone actually financed this piece of garbage. I would be happy to know if it was filmed with a couple of Iphones, of something, because the movie has no substance. It isn't a good film, it isn't even a good porn flick."
"1702","Love",10,"Idc what anyone says, I'd die for this movie","No other film has ever made me feel so sad and so happy to such severe degrees. If it's porn then that honestly doesn't matter. It can be both porn and art."
"1703","Love",10,"Not bad","Darn hot. Absolutely not for anyone under age.
Sex scenes"
"1704","Love",8,"Could've been easily a two part movie.","Gaspar Noé is such an interesting filmmaker, you can hate him all you want but you can't deny his vision has always been amazing. Love (2015) is such a unique movie like i've never seen before, the actor who plays Murphy is great but my only problem was with the actor who plays Electra, I don't know if it's because of his accent but I don't felt too much with her, the actor who plays Omi was good but I wished it was more of her.The story is interesting but I would've loved that it were more complex, this could've been easily a two part movie like Nymphomaniac. Anyway, another great film by Gaspar Noé."
"1705","Love",6,"Sex scenes can't save it from being quite boring","Love is the 4th feature film by Gaspar Noé. His last one 'Enter the Void' came out 6 years ago. As you can tell by the poster Gaspar does not make films for a general audience as they are mostly offensive, brutal and to a certain degree shocking (but that might be underestimating the jaded audience who these days have access to anything on the internet and as such are not easily shocked). Love might actually be his most accessible film as there is no violence but plenty of nudity and sex. Actually it's quite explicit, in the sense that the difference between real porn and this film is that 'Love' has a lot better lighting and cinematography. Now having plenty of sex scenes doesn't make it a good film. I found it rather boring actually and watched it 3 parts because it could not keep my attention. The film goes a bit like this: sex scene / fight scene (vocally, not physical) / make-up sex scene / nag scene / more sex / more nagging...you get the picture, this goes on for about 129 mins. That can get pretty tiresome. Gaspar's idea is that he wants a 'romantic' film where you also get to see the lovemaking and as we are all adults we should see it. But that in itself doesn't make this movie better. Certainly not if your characters are really not that likable. So my recommendation: see it if you are a real die hard Noé fan but otherwise skip it, there are lots of better movies released in 2015."
"1706","Love",6,"It was a beautifully made film, with...far more than I expected!","Love hits you straight out of the box with the first scene. The sex was really, really graphic. I saw this movie in 2D and I can only imagine. I could not before, thinking to myself why would they make a romance movie in 3D?, but now I don't need to imagine, I can never get those images out of my head. They really went extreme.But I will say that I thought the sex scenes got me more emotionally wrapped up in the movie than the actual acting. I did like how a lot of the movie was about what is being shown and the action taking place, but I did not like the actors too much as they read their dialog, which sucks for them considering what they had to do on screen.Overall, I did find the the movie appealing. It reminds me of another movie with hardcore sex scenes, 9 songs, but instead this story about the run of a relationship is not linear, which is what made this movie interesting.It was a little hard for me to watch at times but I thought it was well done."
"1707","Love",10,"Wow this was spiritual lol","It was very compelling, artistic and real they did not hold back.impeccable"
"1708","Love",10,"Wow this is spiritual lol","It was very compelling,real no holding back it was perfect for me."
"1709","Love",1,"a torture","He managed to destroy one of my favourite song
I've never seen such an eccentric director....how can you call the ex Noe and the child Gaspar?!?!??!?
slow 
i think the same of him, the meaning of life is love, but he really didn't get the point"
"1710","Love",2,"Dull, gratuitous, piece of trash","If you want to watch a movie about people who do drugs and have lost of gratuitous sex on screen, this is the one for you. The only thing that makes it different than hardcore porn is that there are more scripted lines. Plot isn't that great, and the movie is boring. Don't waste your time."
"1711","Love",3,"Should have been a short film","Cute here and there (i.e.photography, part of the sex scenes) but so cringe worthy... the dialogues, acting, voice over and some of the timeline are atrocious."
"1712","Love",NA,"Great lighting","This film tells the story of a man trapped with his wife and child, yet he keeps on thinking about his ex-girlfriend who is not contactable. The story then winds back in time to tell how his relationships with his ex-girlfriend and his wife come about.I have heard about the gratuitous explicit sex scenes in the film, and indeed there is a prolonged sex scene every five minutes. The story is quite interesting, as the man reflects and reminisces about Elektra, who is so adventurous that she becomes increasingly unstable. The problems encountered by the man are quite real life, and viewers can easily relate to his situation. What strikes me is that the lighting effects of the film is very remarkable, the use of focused lighting enhances the mood a lot. The slow strobe effect in the swingers' club is captivating. Overall, ""Love"" is worth a watch as it depicts real life relationship problems."
"1713","Love",4,"Annoying..","About 20 minutes in the movie I was already annoyed by this movie and checked how much time was left. I did survive until the end, although sometimes it was questionable why am I torturing myself. I still wanted to know what was there to show in the remaining hour and 40 minutes. Sex scenes were the only good thing about the movie, everything else was pretty miserable and I'm giving it 4 stars only because I support the thought that threesome often ruins relationships. One should have that with a total stranger on a vacation - no names, no contacts, no strings. If you have nothing better to do then watch it, but my suggestion would be to watch the sex scenes and then make love yourself meanwhile."
"1714","Love",NA,"A pleasant surprise","I would love to see the perspective of the woman, made by a woman.This is a male view of the relationship. And it's excellent done. Most probably the script was written by someone who lived something like this story.The first problem is the timeline. What goes after what? While Pulp Fiction and Memento do it flawlessly, French film makers have a very hard time expressing anything but the most rudimentary chronology.The second problem is the character depth. The story was lived. And somehow the writer expects the viewer to fill in the blanks. Hence, much of the audience was lost and there are the reviews.The third problem is the sound track. It is strident. And with the bad chronology and the missing parts the music is distracting making things even worse.The fourth problem: the characters are flat. There is some background thrown in. But there is no depth to the characters. You either know them or you don't. And, because they are not stock characters, most people can't handle them.The fifth problem: sex. It is very well done. And given the crap French film makers can make out of it (ex. Blue is the Warmest Color) this comes as a surprise. But sex is tricky in most markets. And the publicity seems to have polarized the public even more. So a good part of the movie has become a problem.The sixth problem: emotion. Noe shoots very high with this movie. Most of the plot is left out for the sake of lyricism. Which is a good thing. But for me that is not enough. This is a good movie. But Noe is no Kaurismaki or Jarmousch. He is closer to Bigas Luna I think. Anyway, he gets the emotion right. And again, a plus becomes a problem. Because the above five problems, the emotion fails for me.So if you can take sex, go see it. You might not like it. Yet it is an excellent movie, well above what Europe is doing in the last decade."
"1715","Love",2,"Nope","I like Noe's previous work and I like mumbly films that go nowhere, but this is laughably stupid."
"1716","Love",6,"Could have been excellent","This had potential - I like Gaspar Noe, I'm not easily shocked, I appreciate risk-taking and sexual freedom in film and ""Love"" definitely had lots of both. Unfortunately, I echo what a lot of the other reviews have said, that it needed a better script and a better male lead actor. The main female lead, Electra, outshone her male co-star to the point where I was left thinking ""Why so much trouble for this guy?"". His acting felt forced, hollow, just...uninteresting. I actually think the movie could have even lost a bunch of dialogue and would have been better...because the photography, cinematography, music and editing was actually quite cool and kept it feeling alive...where the script was so poor that it made me laugh at moments which I'm guessing was not the intention:)Anyway, I'd say worth checking out/experiencing, if only for the super hot sex scenes that make up about 50% of the movie!"
"1717","Love",1,"Porm in search of an intellectual angle","Gaspard Noé is desperate. His cheap movie would have been better off as a skin flick with some narrative. Instead his TRULY flaccid attempts at being heady AND oh-so-cheaply-shocking with the opening sex scene, he could have been more sensuous. But no...The acting is 3rd rate. The cinematography is nothing special (though the DP should have made some attempt at lighting better!!) and clearly the sound department was run by a deaf person! All in all, trash masquerading at cinema."

"1719","Love",4,"What a waste...","What a waste...What...A...Waste.
the courageous director Gaspar Noe Once again shows us how revealing he can be and takes us to places no other directors has taken us before.
the sex scenes in the movie besides being so open are very well made, the lighting, the placement of characters and the music are all top notch. but however the script is so weak and it's a shame that a movie that has all of those good qualities is wasted on this script.
it fails to show us the challenges they go through as a couple, it doesn't put us through the emotional states that the characters are going through and at the end it expects us to completely feel the agony that the main character's in.
and also the acting is terrible, which is understandable, because there aren't a lot of good actors/actresses who will literally cum in front of camera."
"1720","Love",5,"No Depth on the Storyline","The movie is all based to get who is watching into the experience the characters are living in, but it does it poorly. Bad performance and no deep exploration on the characters feelings and thoughts.
For this proposal I would recommend a 10/10 movie ""blue is the warmest color"".
Rated it 5 anyway for the bold try of the storyline and the commitment of the actors to do real sex."
"1721","Love",5,"The story that was narrated backwards!","This was from the director of 'Irreversible'. This story was told in backwards. It opened with a married couple having sexual intercourse and after a phone call, the flashback rolls. Which begins from that point of the story where it stands to where it all began as per the film character who recalls all the events. Actually, it was impressive idea, not that reverse way storytelling, but how the characters were drawn. And then the story was very simple, like the film '9½ Weeks', the drama and the sex parts shared the remaining narration alternatively for like every 10-15 minutes.I wanted to like it, but not convinced with the blend between both the drama and sex scenes. They should have developed and blended them together better. Especially since the storytelling was reversified, one of the major plot holes is not solved or revealing what could have happened to that particular character on which this plot was developed. If you are not concerned about the storyline and looking for adult contents as in a film, not as a better porn film, then you might enjoy it.The other major issue was the length. Two hours long for an adult film means teasing and testing your patience. It should have been under 90 minutes, that would have speeded it up a bit. The actors were decent. The film poster was so hot, it will drag you to watch this film. But I would say not to expect big, either adult stuffs or from the dramatic segments. Within its frame, it delivered, but for me it was an average and a little below.4.5/10"
"1722","The Godfather",10,"For Me, This Is The Definitive Film","This isn't just a beautifully crafted gangster film. Or an outstanding family portrait, for that matter. An amazing period piece. A character study. A lesson in filmmaking and an inspiration to generations of actors, directors, screenwriters and producers. For me, this is more: this is the definitive film. 10 stars out of 10.Favorite films: IMDb.com/list/mkjOKvqlSBs/Lesser-Known Masterpieces: imdb.com/list/ls070242495/"
"1723","The Godfather",10,"The greatest movie of all time!","One of the best films of all time, an absolute masterpiece. The Godfather is arguably the best gangster drama as well as setting the standard for cinema."
"1724","The Godfather",10,"An offer so good, I couldn't refuse","It is now past 1 PM and I just finished watching Francis Ford Coppola's ""The Godfather"". I should probably go to bed. It's late and tomorrow I have to wake up a bit early. But not early enough to postpone writing these lines. Now that I have seen it three times, the opportunity of sharing my thoughts and refreshed insights are too much of a good offer to sit on. So, bear with me.This film works so well because it takes place in an underworld in which we are so embedded that we do not even observe it. Coppola puts us straight in the smack-dab center of what is, admittedly, a society made by criminals for criminals. It is also the reason why it's so welcoming. We are surrounded by its inhabitants--cold-blooded murderers, men who see crime like a 9 to 5 job masquerading as honorable men. And I do mean men. From the outside, we would only witness the horrifying, disturbing manifestations of their well-thought out actions.But it goes even deeper than that. It all revolves around the Corleone family led by Don Vito Corleone (Marlon Brando). He is the most honest of these men, sitting right on the edge. But for people like him, who do not fully embrace this world, it's not easy. He avoids conflict until it is absolutely necessary. He is a man defined by moral principles. There is a scene at the beginning, in which, during his daughter's wedding day, one of his associates, Luca Brasi (Lenny Montana) practices his speech that he is going to give to the Don when he meets him. The scene with these two is funny and almost adorable. I could not help but sympathize both of them only to realize that I am feeling warmth for two mobsters. Not to even mention that Lenny Montana was an actual mob hit-man and that he was actually nervous as he said that line.The more I watched the more I realized just how incredibly complex and ruthless this society is and how it has the power to corrupt anyone to come in contact with it. The best example is Corleone's youngest son, Michael (Al Pacino). He returns home for his sister's wedding as a war hero dressed the part with his long-time girlfriend, Kay Adams (Diane Keaton). At first, he avoids this underworld, but necessity, first-hand exposure and just its sheer devilish appealing nature draws him in. As we get further in the film, the change is shocking and every outsider who ever got close to him is tainted in one way or another. If they survive it, they are drawn in as well as we are as viewers.Inside, Coppola exposes the family to us fully, with a bold personal approach and we witness every discussion, every methodically calculated choice. Crime is done simply because it is the nature of their business, and we are put on a chair alongside them, so we easily relate. For us, they are the good guys, the rival families are the bad guys. This is the greatest feat this film managed to pull off--set apart good guys and bad guys in a world filled with bad guys.This is a film of unmatched subtlety. No other movie sustains itself as good. No other film is done with such precision, attention and completeness. There are many layers which I probably missed and maybe will never notice. But I felt them. What director Francis Ford Coppola and his partner in crime (poor choice of words, sorry) Mario Puzo did is nothing short of a timeless piece of reference cinema whose influence is not based on reinventing the wheel, but rather perfecting it to the absolute maximum.Most masterpieces are remembered for their historical contributions. ""Citizen Kane"" brought the biggest step-up to the art form, the same things did ""Gone With the Wind"" or ""2001: A Space Odyssey"". ""The Godfather"" is one of the few films that will be remembered simply because they are that good and I cannot possibly imagine a greater achievement."
"1725","The Godfather",10,"Initially, I wasn't a fan... but then I realised","This is a masterpiece. A timeless masterpiece. Initially, I didn't like this film all that much - I found it rather over-hyped and boring. This was until the advent of DVD, which gave me the feature I needed for this sort of film: subtitles. Once I switched them on and heard (read) every last word of Brando's ramblings and other characters ramblings, I grew a true appreciation for this epic.To make a true epic, you need all of three following ingredients working in near perfect harmony. For screenwriters who come across this, take the following pointers on board: 1) Contrasting Characters: Good films have some character distinction, but most fall rather flat because the core of each character is the same.Of course, there are exceptions to rule (ie... where you want mono-tonal characters... aka matrix; or where you want outlandish contrasts... aka The Fifth Element), but ultimately, this is what makes films deep, meaningful and grand. Consider the contrasts between the Don's children. Michael is rather cool, rational and collected, whereas Sonny is more hot-headed, spontaneous and simple minded. But simply having these contrasts is not nearly enough. What you really need to do is to develop these characters - place them in situations - and then dwell on how their character impacts on the situation they're put in. The Godfather is a terrific example of how to pull this off. While many try to do this in screenplays, most lose the plot and create character obscurities that stretch credibility.2) Transformation: The central character(s) must undergo a transformation, resulting in them being almost unrecognizable by the end of the film. By putting them into situations, the character's character must not only influence the outcome of the situation; it must also have a lasting impact on the character. Consider Michael at the wedding and compare that to the Michael we see at the end of the film. Again, many films try, but most fail because they come up with unreal (literally, not praisingly) or simply moronic transformations (eg, Wall Street).3) Patience: Men in Black 2 was an astounding film for one simple reason - it was an entire film squashed into about 70 minutes. It was not much longer than an episode of ER or Buffy. I certainly hope the new goal of Hollywood isn't to make films as short as possible.All the great ones spend time - time developing characters, family life, growth, patience with the story telling in general. This is the key (provided that the story isn't mind-numbingly boring). Dances with Wolves, Heat.. and so on are very patient but top-class films. While studios may be lukewarm on the idea of longer films, they are worth it if you have a ripper story to base it on.I feel that this film has not dated all that much and has tremendous re-watch-ability."
"1726","The Godfather",10,"Amazing movie","The acting was simply amazing, what else could you say. What could be more appealing to people(even today) than watching actors like Al Pacino, Marlon Brando, James Caan, Diane Keaton, Talia Shire and Robert Duvall. This is like heaven for someone who is a fan of movies. With this movie Brando was able to bring himself back into the limelight. His performance as the godfather alone is iconic. His character has been recreated so much in films that it has almost if it has not already become a cliché. His performance though was not a cliché. His performance was subtle and breathtaking. It was so genuine and realistic that it was not just probably but definitely more genuine than Marlon Brando himself. Al Pacino was perfect for this film as well. What a way to start up your career. His character was all about depth and he displayed it perfectly. He was able to display his own inner-battles in his mind as well as the battles he had with his family, friends and enemies. His character was more of a psychological character study than anything else to me. Robert Duvall to me was the glue to the movie. He added a different perspective to everything in just that he was not Italian yet having the respect of the mafia. His character is a man of high authority within the Corleone family who was listened to and insightful;. This was simply perfect giving the film great balance throughout. The rest of the cast was just icing on the cake.The writing was phenomenal and breathtaking. As mentioned before there has been no movie quoted more than this. It is not even the quotes though that makes the writing in here so perfect. It is the symbolism and meaning that went into every scene. There are countless symbols, messages and lines in here that are so memorable yet it is as realistic as a movie could get."
"1727","The Godfather",10,"How things were done back then!","The directing by Coppola was perfect as well. Not many movies can be 3 hours and yet maintain a good level of interest from the audience like The Godfather. Coppola deserves credit for this. The symbolism and messages that went into every scene also has to do with the directing not just the writing. The movie is so well edited and strung together that the only word that could come to my mind is perfection.The cinematography and music were perfect. The score of this movie is one of the most memorable ever. If you were to hear it you could identify it right away. The cinematography was what actually really drove this movie. The Godfather seems to have this mystique to it, it gives you the feeling you are watching something truly remarkable."
"1728","The Godfather",10,"This Movie Has Haunted My Life...","I love this movie and all of the GF movies. I see something new every time I have seen it (countless, truly). The story of tragedy and (little) comedy that exists in this film is easily understood by people all over the world. This film has been called an American story however I have met others who have seen this movie in other languages and they seem to have the same love and appreciation for it that I do. I love the characters and all of the different personalities that they represent not just in families but in society itself. It seems like the entire cast is part of every other movie that I love as well. The sounds, music, color and light in the film are just as much a part of the film as the people. This could be attributed to the method in which it was filmed. At many parts of the film I can still find myself feeling the emotions conveyed in the film. I never tire of appreciating this film. I thank God that FFC is an American treasure. We are fortunate to have him."
"1729","The Godfather",10,"A Masterpiece","This must rank as the best film (along with part 2)of all time.An ensemble performance that has no weak spot.Particularly, John Cazale ( Fredo) and Richard Castellano ( Clemenza) give wonderfully understated performances. You just have to believe that Castellano WAS Clemenza, he brings a real touch to his role.John Cazale brings the troubled Fredo to life, and you can see the weak Fredo desperately trying to live up to the family reputation but knowing that he can never be what his father wants. The story of one man's reluctance to be drawn into the murky family business,and his gradual change through circumstance, paints a vivid picture of this violent period of US history.Do not miss this film!"
"1730","The Godfather",10,"perfect","This movie is strong, good script, great casting, excellent acting, and over the top directing.  It is hard to fine a movie done this well, it is 29 years old and has aged well.  Even if the viewer does not like mafia type of movies, he or she will watch the entire film, the audiences is glued to what will happen next as the film progresses.  Its about, family, loyalty, greed, relationships, and real life.  This is a great mix, and the artistic style make the film memorable."
"1731","The Godfather",10,"The world inside the underworld!","The godfather trilogy is an exclusive set of movies that will continue to live with humanity, every generation will see them to say, ""Oh that was 10 out of 10."" If you watch them you will know that the world that lives inside the underworld is same as the one we live in except that people in underworld are so smart, in fact smartness is the only thing that can keep them there. Don Vito Caroleone's early life shown in part-II is very well done to show the Don in making, how a kid who couldn't even tell his name went on becoming a underworld don who keep most senators, judges and lawyers in his pocket. Meeting of don with the so call five families are among most impressive scenes.A saga that goes on for 9 continuous hours takes you around various walks in life of Mike (Don's younger son who become Don later), his school days, love life, personal life, family life, business life, political life and religious life. How all of these different roles Mike plays in his life and how intertwined these are.I enjoyed watching these movies so much, I wish I had seen them much before then I did. Its amazing to see how the Part-III was made 18 years later the part-I was made and everything looks so continuous if watch them together.I need not say much! The Godfather father trilogy been around for a while and everyone knows that they are great set of movies, its just the matter of when you actually get to see them.Watch them! Kudos to Francis Ford Coppola! -Vishy"
"1732","The Godfather",10,"MAFIA MAGIC","A mafia masterpiece from FRANCIS FORD COPPOLA,the first part of this chronological trilogy tells the rise of MICHAEL CORLEONE in superb fashion,everything from the sets to the stellar cast is perfect to the point of almost feeling like its a fly on the wall drama,AL PACINO excels here but it is truly MARLON BRANDO that steals the show with a fantastic portrayal of an ageing head of a crime family.with a fantastic script from MARIO PUZO of SUPERMAN the movie fame this is without a doubt the best mafia story portrayed on the silver screen....if you like mafia/gangster movies this is the one that will explain why...this is a trilogy you wont forget"
"1733","The Godfather",10,"Simply the best","This film is pretty much the perfection of the craft. Every single aspect of The Godfather is outstanding. There are so many iconic lines and moments throughout the movie that have been replicated and entrenched in culture over the years. There really isn't too much else to say. This is truly the peak of filmmaking."
"1734","The Godfather",10,"The Godfather","Engrossing motion picture that features some of the finest editing, cinematography and performances ever. There is a wonderful theme of family that runs through this film and its later sequels. No one is truly judged. Love is unconditional. God is the one who truly judges. Easily, the word masterpiece describes this film, but that's been said by so many...Who am I to argue? Masterpiece is right on the money."
"1735","The Godfather",9,"""I'm Going To Make Him An Offer He Can't Refuse""","When I first saw The Godfather many years ago, I initially called the film ""a long, boring piece of crap."" Luckily as I have matured, so have my tastes in cinema. This film is heralded as an American classic, and now I can wholeheartedly agree with that sentiment. As famed critic Roger Ebert pointed out, this movie is the one where most people can agree on its quality. Ultimately, The Godfather is still a very long movie but I have come to appreciate it more with each viewing. The film is obviously about the mafia, but this is a different kind of mafia film. Prior mafia films and even those after this one deals with perspectives from an outsider and their perceptions of violence and death with the mafia. However, this film is told within the confinements of a mafia family. The story is told within the inside and that was a unique story angle at that time. I like how the film doesn't show corruption from the mafia family, the Corleones. There are no civilian casualties from organized crime and the only corrupt person in the film is in the form of a police officer. Don Corleone doesn't believe in dealing with drugs, because of how they affect people. The themes of the Corleone family and the movie itself is family and loyalty. As Michael Corleone points out in the movie, ""never take sides against the family."" That is when crazy things begin to happen.The beginning of the movie is very crucial. It is basically a large wedding scene with scenes intercut of Don Corleone in his darkened office taking care of family business. This beginning is important for several reasons. We get the tone of the film and we understand who the Corleone family is. This is also where all the characters are introduced and explained. By the time the scene is over, we get the big picture of the film and we get a sense where the film is heading. The scene is a bit long, but I felt director Francis Ford Coppola did an excellent job on introducing all of his main characters in the filmThis is a film about family and it takes advantage of the classic structure of handing power between generations. The patriarch of the family is Don Vito Corleone (Marlon Brando) who is the head of one of the most powerful mafia families. His children, who play a huge factor in the family, are Sonny (James Caan), Michael (Al Pacino), Connie (Talia Shire), and Fredo (John Cazale). Also playing a huge role is the family lawyer, Tom Hagen (Robert Duvall). The aging Vito decides to transfer power to one of his subalterns, and that causes a ripple between the five Mafia families in New York. The main child here is Michael, who didn't want anything to do with his family and instead join the military. But after Vito is shot, Mike decides to join the family business and take control.The acting is absolutely fantastic. Marlon Brando delivered one of the best performances of his career as the aging head of the family. He is known for using his devices in the beginning such as his puffy cheeks and the cat on his lap. The way he delivered his dialogue in such a soft-spoken voice is also very memorable. Al Pacino does a very good job, taking wise advice from his father while delivering on his own counsel. This is the beginning for Pacino's illustrious career. Robert Duvall does a fantastic job as Hagen. Duvall has had a legendary career, but the one role I think of every time I reflect on his career is his role as Tom Hagen. James Caan does a great job as the quick-tempered Sonny.The one thing that does irk me about the film is the use of women. It seems like women has no part of the family. Mike's sister, Connie (played solidly by Talia Shire) is only used for a target of her husband's Carlo anger. He treats her like a piece of filth. Although, Mike does have a special place in his heart for Connie. Mike also has a romantic interest in the film named Kay Adams (played by the eccentric Diane Keaton). I didn't think Kay was a strong character in the film. Also, Vito has a wife but she is just an insignificant shadow only meant for the family pictures. Finally, there is a Sicilian woman we meet. After Michael goes on exile in Sicily for shooting a cop who played a role in the shooting of his father, he falls in love with this girl<U+0085>..but she ends up getting blown up. My only qualm abut the film is how little importance women play in it.Also playing a huge role in the film is the music. Coppola traveled to Italy to find a composer who can bring an Italian feeling to the film. His find, Nino Rota did just that. The main title is heavily influenced by Italian culture and it gave an authentic feeling to the film-as the main characters are an Italian family. It's a shame that the Academy snubbed his music, because I felt it should have won an Oscar. It's one of my favorite all-time scores.Nominated for 11 Oscars and winning 3 of them including Best Picture, The Godfather is one of America's most influential films. The movie remains popular to this day and if you haven't seen the film, you should see it. It's almost three hours long, but this is a portrait of a mafia family that is all about family. Francis Ford Coppola did an amazing job directing this film from the very popular novel written by Mario Puzo. The Godfather is an instant American classic.My Grade: A-"
"1736","The Godfather",10,"The Pioneer of All Filmmaking","The Godfather is one of the most iconic films in cinema history. There are three points in the film that made it stand alone: direction, acting, and writing. The direction of this film was great! Frances Fran Coppela really knows how to make a great film. Like Steven Spilberg, Peter Jackson, James Cameron, and so many others, he as list himself as one of the most greatest directors in Hollywood. He's my role model. The acting was terrible, just kidding! :) The Acting was amazing. Marlon Brando carries the anchor of this movie, but Al Pacino holds it carefully. The cast of this movie was a good example of cast chemistry. Great Cast! The Writing was awesome. Coppela knows what he is doing when he is writing a script to a major blockbuster hit. That's why he's my role model. The Godfather is one my favorite films of all time. I would recommend you see this movie. It's awesome."
"1737","The Godfather",10,"The Greatest Film of All Time ! Period.","This film contains all the elements of a genuine masterpiece. Its attention to detail, history, and tradition. An absolutely wonderful screenplay. Its comparative closeness to the novel and a storyline which became the template for future stories in this genre. As for the performances: there is not one single character flaw in this entire cast. What continues to amaze me about this film more than any other is the fact that not only were the correct actors and actresses chosen for the roles but that they were each chosen at the perfect point in their respective careers. Throughout this film, there is not one actor nor actress who seems ""too old or young for the part"". Nor does anyone (including an extremely strong Diane Keaton) seem ""out of place"" or ""unconvincing"". The plot and storyline could not have been better and this is one film that no matter how many times you've seen it, it still continues to amaze, entertain, and (in some ways) inform. Like some of the classics which preceded it, it holds up very well over time and will probably continue to do so. I currently own on VHS ""The Godfather Saga"" (the first 2 movies woven together in chronological order) which is absolutely amazing. It begins with the birth of Vito and ends with the eventual rise of Michael. Although Francis Ford Coppola does not like this version of his epic, I sure wish he would release it on DVD."
"1738","The Godfather",10,"For me it isn't ""the greatest ever"", but it's still great","Marlon Brando is Don Vito Corleone, head of perhaps the most powerful New York-area mafia family in the 1940s, in this well-respected film by director/writer Francis Ford Coppola. As the film begins, Vito is receiving ""business"" guests in his office at his home while his daughter Connie's (Talia Shire) wedding and reception are taking place. The epic plot takes place over many years, telling the story of Vito, his family--including Michael (Al Pacino), Santino (James Caan) and Tom Hagen (Robert Duvall), his associates, and their interactions with other mob syndicates.The Godfather is commonly considered to be one of the ""greatest films of all time"". Even though I've given it a 10, I wouldn't put that same kind of exalted emphasis on it. I've given literally thousands of films 10s over the years, and for me, Godfather just barely made a 10. I think it has a number of flaws, but Coppola also has a knack for transcending the problems with some brilliant move or another. At any rate, it is definitely must-see viewing--even if it's only because it's so highly regarded--if you've not experienced the film yet. I think it's a good idea to attain cultural literacy, and films as popularly loved as The Godfather become necessary elements in achieving that literacy.Shorn of its gangster trappings, The Godfather is sprawling and soap-operatic in tone. The sprawl is appropriate to its origins as a novel by Mario Puzo, who also co-wrote the screenplay with Coppola. There is a large cast of characters--maybe too large, as it can be difficult to keep track of just who everyone is. Even after you've watched the film a couple times you may find scenes where mobsters seem to spontaneously appear and you catch yourself saying, ""Wait, who is that guy supposed to be again?"" The soap opera angle can be a positive or negative depending on your tastes. I tend to not like soap-operatic stories, but of course Coppola put yummy gangster topping on this one to make it palatable for guys like me. At root, though, The Godfather is concerned with realistic depictions of a very dysfunctional family as they try to make it through life--including marriages, births, adultery, spats between family members, tiffs with others in their community, and so on. My theory is that the soap opera angle accounts for much of the film's appeal. For me, it (and the slight lack of focus from the sprawl) accounts for much of the reason that I barely gave the film a 10.But two things help the film transcend a lower score for me. Even though the gangster stuff has been far surpassed in graphic brutality in the intervening years, the dramatic context of the violence usually gives it tremendous impact. Films like Ichi the Killer (2001), which I just watched for the first time the night before watching The Godfather again, make the Godfather's brutality fit for Sesame Street in comparison. However, although Ichi's violence is effective, setting that knob to ""11"" doesn't make it better. Besides, Ichi is so over the top that it would make many Godfather fans want to hurl.To the extent that Coppola and Puzo just focus on the extended Corleone family, they create tremendous depth in their relationships. The whole film can be looked at as a fascinating depiction of ""oscillating"" dynamics in the family, with the pole pairs being interacting/distancing, control/lack of control, benevolence/malevolence. Most character stances and actions are some combination of those ranges of characteristics, and everyone dances around the poles, so to speak, throughout the film. From this angle, even the attractive surface violence (well, attractive to us fans of that stuff in artworks) is mainly there for the purpose of pushing characters more to one pole or the other. There is an implication that underlying these mechanisms is some natural tendency towards achieving (a dynamic) equilibrium.But there are more superficial stylistic factors that help push my score up to a 10, also. The most obvious, which everyone and their grandparents have mentioned, are the performances. It's tough to go wrong when you have a cast including Al Pacino, Marlon Brando, Robert Duvall, James Caan, Diane Keaton, and so on. Another commonly mentioned element that I agree is fantastic and superbly integrated to create atmosphere is Nino Rota's score.Less often mentioned is the consistently intriguing cinematography by Gordon Willis. Most of Willis' unusual shots in the film are so subtle as to be barely noticeable unless you're looking for them. The opening, for example, consists of a long (it lasts a few minutes) ""zoom out"" from Amerigo Bonasera (Salvatore Corsitto). The shot is beautifully lit--most of the frame is extremely dark, giving Bonasera a chiaroscuro effect (the opening is also unusual in that it's a long monologue from a minor character).Willis and Coppola have a knack for placing their actors in the frame to create depth and interesting visual patterns. This is done so slyly that at first blush you wouldn't believe it's something they thought about, but if you keep this in mind while watching, you can see delightful visual paths that zigzag, wind to a focal point, and so on, all created by the confluence of actors and scenery in the frame.If you haven't seen The Godfather before, the most important thing you can do before watching is to forget about all of the ""greatest film of all time"" hype. That's only likely to set up expectations that could never be met; more than likely you'll be disappointed. Just think of it as one of the better films from one of Hollywood's more admirable but relatively odder directors, featuring earlier performances from a very well known cast, and keep in mind that it's as much a ""historical family saga"" as a crime or gangster film."
"1739","The Godfather",10,"The film of films","A flawless movie. This movie translates from the book perfectly!This movie made me want to be a director and create film. Everyone's acting was perfect.
To think that Puza wrote this specifically to make a hit is at first crazy."
"1740","The Godfather",10,"Perfection","Alright, this movie is simply perfect. I don't have one bad thing to say about it honestly. Phenomenal acting from few of Hollywood's greatest talents. Al Pacino gives a career defying performance in The Godfather along side Marlon Brando, James Caan, Robert Duvall and a young Diane Keaton. This movie is simply perfect. This adaptation of Mario Puzo's book tells the tale of an immigrant living the American Dream. But even though all of the starts were absolutely phenomenal in their individual roles only one remains more iconic than the others--Marlon Brando as Don Vito. Fans of the movie will come back and watch it again and again to witness Brando in his absolute finest."
"1741","The Godfather",10,"Perfection on film (with Godfather II as it's worthy companion piece ... sadly Godfather III - Godawful.)","To the (few) giving poor revues ... be very careful. It'll be a late night knock on your door or an invitation for coffee from an old 'friend' or maybe you'll be in a cinema watching Shawshank Redemption, then KAPOW! You'll be nothing more than a red smudge on the wallpaper.
You must never go against the family.
Correct your revue now or it will be you who's 'corrected'."
"1742","The Godfather",9,"One of the all time greatest","There is always a risk when a film becomes a huge part of popular culture. So many of it's iconic moments and scenes are ripped off, riffed on, or parodied by countless shows and movies, that there is always a fear that the original will lose some of it's impact, and become comical and stale. The Godfather, however, disproves this. It is still a masterpiece, and always will be. The story-line proves once again how much the innocent public loves to view the lives of outright evil men, especially when they happen to be of the charming and charismatic variety. Let's look at the most iconic scene; a man chops off a horse's head, and leaves it in his owner's bed in order to scare him into submission. Oh yeah, he's one of the good guys though, so it's okay!Everything is explored in the Godfather, either directly or subtly; family politics, gangland negotiation, corrupt officials, there is no part of the mafia experience that is not pictured here, taken from the viewpoint of Michael, a character whose transition from unwilling family outsider and war-hero into the don himself really gives the film a unique perspective. Of course, for me, out of all the fantastic characters, the film is carried by Marlon Brando. There is something magnetic about his performance, a mixture of loving family man, ruthless career criminal, and sophisticated Sicilian gentleman, that is thrilling to watch. One of the all time greatest acting performances."
"1743","The Godfather",9,"A movie that can not be abandoned","An important place in American history is the period when several thousand Sicilian emigrants went to the United States in search of a new, better life, in which there would be no tyranny of the Palermo and Messinxich dons. Who knew at that time that this ""bunch of Sicilian emigrants"" would occupy a high place in the United States and in the history of this country.Sicily is one of the most beautiful places in Italy. Unfortunately Sicilians, quite friendly inhabitants of this island, the words-synonyms of Sicily are not only olives, butter and wine, but also words like omerta, vendetta and mafia. Yes, the mafia. A small bunch of bandit mackerel in Sicily, run by the Don. In the US, this word took a slightly different meaning. A huge number of gangsters who seek to conquer and rule all the States. A family is a mafia, a mafia is a family headed by a cruel and wise person who manages everything and who owns everything. Proudly and shortly - don.Mario Puzo is a brilliant writer, rightly considered to be a recognized classic of the twentieth-century literature, having written several excellent and worthy works, the best of which is undoubtedly the novel ""The Godfather"". A book about the life of gangsters and revealing all the doors to the world of the mafia. Mario Puzo was a great connoisseur of human psychology, but the psychology of people who transgressed the law especially. That is why in his novel he explores each character to the depths of his soul and climbs into the most intimate corners of their thoughts.The novel, and indeed, the film - is not a direct and reliable historical source, but, nevertheless, it contains the quintessence of the criminal world. Five families of New York Piuso wrote from the real five families of New York, Johnny Fontaine Puzo wrote from Frank Sinatra. The literature was tired of books about Al Capone and Frank Costello, and Puzo made a move to a horse-invented a criminal family that was not really there, but which subsequently won, without exaggeration, the whole world.It often happens that the director, when stating a picture, leaves the original and is engaged in arbitrariness. Francis Ford Coppola director is no less brilliant than the rest of the directors. He squeezed everything that can be learned from the novel Puzo and put it into the film. Doing nothing without adding something new or removing something from the book, Coppola and Puzo created a masterpiece. A masterpiece in everything. Mario Puzo's book became a masterpiece of literature, and Francis Ford Coppola created the film - a masterpiece, a film - a classic that just can not help but like it. Coppola not only superbly put the film, but simply brilliantly picked up the actors. Who knows what was the fate of the film without Marlon Brando and Al Pacino. Coppola skillfully created the atmosphere of New York at the end of the forties, but also the atmosphere of family life, the life of people from Sicily.Vito Carleone is a wise and cruel man with clear principles, a loving but stern father. Marlon Brando was just awesome dona
Carleone. His character is a serious strategist who has achieved power and respect himself. Don Carleone's sad gaze, his smooth gestures, his unique voice and his unforgettable ""bulldog jaw"" forever blended into the image of the viewer.Don Carleone - this is Marlon Brando - sloven and lover in life, but on the screen - a genius who embodied the image of Don Carleone - a strong spirit of a man and a cruel gangster, who has enormous authority. Vito Carleone is a very impressive person who knew how to get others to do things their own way. Marlon Brando with his game was able to make the viewer believe that before him is not just an actor playing a role, but a real person is that same severe don. Brando is a great improvisator.Michael Carleone character is no less interesting than his father. Michael is kind-hearted and truthful, knowing what his father does, he never wanted to deal with his family and participate in criminal quarrels. Al Pacino played his character no less brilliant than Marlon Brando. Pacino showed all the destruction of the human psyche and the transformation of his hero: from the uninitiated in the affairs of the family of the young war hero, to the new Don Carleone, possessing an iron will, foresight, wisdom and dignity.
Sonny Carleone is not at all like Michael and Vito. He is an impulsive warrior, but a bad strategist who prefers to go ahead, not act cunning. Coppola did not lose on the fact that he called for the role of an American from Sicily. James Caan brilliantly played the role of Sonny - a man with an explosive Italian temperament, ready to always stand up for the family.In addition to the brilliant acting and excellent production in the film, there is the wonderful music of the composer Nina Rota. An excellent melody, fallen in love with everyone and has long become a classic.""Godfather"" is a masterpiece, an ideal gangster movie. The film without minuses, blunders and cliches, which pulls to review, even if you know it by heart. This is a classic, a gangster epic, a bible for cinephiles, giving answers to all the questions. A movie that teems with crown phrases that have long since become part of everyday life. A worthy picture, without exaggeration, is the best in its kind.""Behind every wealth lies a crime"" (c) - it is this phrase Honore De Balzac stands at the beginning of the work of Puzo. The film, if briefly, actually about it. And about the proposal, ""from which you can not refuse"" (c)."
"1744","The Godfather",10,"I'm finding it hard to describe how amazing this movie was","There is very little that I can add to the reviews on here, that have explained what is so wonderful about The Godfather so well. I have seen many amazing movies, as well as some clunkers, but The Godfather was beyond amazing. There are so many images, details and scenes that I seriously cannot get out of my head since watching it for the first time just nine hours ago. The Godfather is so incredibly well-made and acted that it stands out among the rest of those other amazing films I've seen, so much so I couldn't think of a single flaw, and I am struggling to think of a good enough reason to why I didn't see this film before now.True, The Godfather is a little slow-moving and the plot takes a while to unfold, but neither of these are flaws as such. The slow pacing added to the elegiac quality The Godfather has, and as for the plot what is special about this plot is that it is very unpredictable because you have next to no idea where it is next going to take you. Being 18, I was worried whether I was old enough to appreciate this film or even understand it, but luckily I understood it perfectly, and I can well and truly appreciate it for the masterpiece it is considered to be.The Godfather for one thing looks stunning. I strongly disagree with the previous reviewer who said the cinematography was horrid, for me the cinematography was one of the best assets of the film. In some scenes you have cinematography and lighting that is quite dark and mysterious, and then in scenes such as the wedding it is evergreen, autumnal and very picturesque. It is not just the cinematography that makes The Godfather look stunning, the costumes are beautifully tailored, the houses are gorgeous and majestic to look at and even the cars were immaculate.Then there is the score by Nina Rota. One word, outstanding! I have heard many wonderful scores in my lifetime, but after hearing this score few stick in the memory as much as the score for The Godfather. This score is both beautiful as seen with the main theme, and haunting in the way it sticks in your head after watching the film itself. Other outstanding assets are the masterly direction from Francis Ford Coppola, and the brilliantly written screenplay that is intelligent, thought-provoking and darkly humorous. As for the violence, some of it is shocking and intense especially in the climax which was enough to almost make your heart either beat twice as fast or stop, and I almost covered my eyes when the producer found the horse's head in his bed, but underneath that this family is somewhat loyal and honourable come to think of it.The acting is absolutely fantastic, bringing to life characters that are rich and complex, perhaps unlikeable at first but as you get to know them you warm to them. And I have to say, The Godfather is one of those rarities where no actor gives a weak performance. In particular, Marlon Brando is brilliant as Don Vito, very heavily disguised yet stately. Every word of dialogue, every subtle hand gesture and every facial expression was brilliantly judged. Al Pacino's casting was admittedly risky, but he still did a truly wonderful job carrying the film, while James Caan is dignified and loyal, Diane Keaton beautiful and alluring and Robert Duvall nicely understated.In conclusion, absolutely amazing, and I can see completely why it is considered one of the 10 greatest movies ever made, it is that good. In fact my 15-year old brother loved it so much, he wants to see it again. 10/10, though this film is too good for that rating. Bethany Cox"
"1745","The Godfather",8,"Slightly overrated","One thing that's a bit annoying when seeing `The Godfather' is the sense that, as a viewer, you feel you are required to bow down before this film and worship it as movie perfection, or else reveal yourself to be a person of no taste. Well, I can definitely acknowledge that this is a very good movie, but not necessarily great, nor is it on my personal favorites list.
For starters, while this definitely gives you some great characters and atmosphere, there's really nothing in this movie that you couldn't get from reading the book. In fact, the strength of this film comes from the way the director and actors faithfully bring the novel to life.What's best? No question - the acting. Judged on that scale alone, it gets a 10. I cannot disagree with those who state that this combines the best acting performances in American film history. The directing and scriptwriting are also very good, worthy of at least a 9.
What's not so good? The pacing. As others have noted, this film can be boring at times. Most notably, at least for me, was the time spent showing Mike in Sicily after he shot the cop and the Turk. Other than getting married, it doesn't really show him doing much of anything, nor does it really contribute much to the story. In contrast, the book made this particular sub-plot far more interesting and relevant.And that, at heart, is my problem. I've seen the movie and I've read the book. And I far more enjoyed the latter. The book gives all sorts of details the movie skips. For example, in the film, Al Neri is just a guy dressed up as a cop who performs as one of Mike's hit men. In the book, we learn how he went from being a good cop with a bad temper to taking over the role once held by Luca Brasi (another character who is developed far more fully in the book).So there you have it. On the one hand, you have to intellectually acknowledge the great talent displayed in the making of this film, but on the other, I must admit it just isn't very satisfying emotionally. These characters seem cold and distant, and I never really cared much for any of them. In that respect, I much more preferred ""Goodfellas"". The acting wasn't as good, but the characters were far more engaging and the pacing much more lively. In short, `The Godfather' is sort of like a great, but somber, piece of music, something you can admire but not dance to.8/10"
"1746","The Godfather",10,"The Classic,Iconic movie ever!","It was slow burn the way every scene played it was amazing to look it's too slow yet engaging to look the meetings background were skeptical.the Music and the use of it is phenomenal whenever something is happening the music was way too calm and terrifying at same time!the story was amazing the family of gangster and the society of gangsters and there feuds!the acting was iconic especially by marlon and al and everyone was amazing as there characters!screenplay was good at start it was slow and boring at the wedding as it was just intro to what is next then when the horse scene up from then it was entertaining and calm to watch,the ending was satisfyingly amazing the way mike turned gangster was iconic and at last the look on the face and music while talking to wife was the signal that he's no more mike he's The Godfather now!overall A Classic Gangster Masterpiece the theme is dark and calm at same time.Iconic movie!"
"1747","The Godfather",10,"Perfect","This movie is simply perfect. Whether it's the acting, scenery, pacing or anything else, it's all just so brilliantly executed. Every scene is so memorable, that I just can't think of any reason to rate this movie lower than a 10/10."
"1748","The Godfather",10,"The greatest film of all time.","The power of cinema at its purest and most vivid expression. Screenplay, direction, cinematography, acting, editing, it all comes in the most elevated form. Francis Ford Coppola is a craftsman, as every director and artist should be, that draws inspiration from the power of the words and of the actions of characters and provides the standard upon which all the following history of cinema relies. It's an historic work of art."
"1749","The Godfather",10,"Never Fails","I must have watched this movie 30 times, yet it is interesting and enjoyable every time. Beautifully filmed and written, it is like reading a great novel, the heroes are villains but you get so lost in the story it doesn't matter, it is a prime example of the art of movie making, perhaps the best."
"1750","The Godfather",NA,"Perhaps the Greatest of All Time?","I never liked the IMDb top 250 list. So i haven't thought about this one for a very long time. Then i watched Shawshank and immediately became a fan. Somewhere i read that Godfather was at the top of the 250 before Shawshank and that's when i decided to take a chance with Godfather. I wasn't a fan of gangster flicks so it's fair to say i never thought i'd sit through all 3 hours and minutes. What can i say? This film changed every thing about my taste in movies. After watching this i ended up as a fan of gangster movies and i went on to watch some pretty old movies and some of the longest running films. (And now i am a fan of IMDb's 250)I had a go at this movie again (for the 5th time)yesterday and compelled to write a review here.I'm not gonna say anything new here after all these 1687 reviews but anyone reading this i guess you probably watched the movie and inspired enough to read the reviews here. If that so give me a thumps up! In my opinion The Greatest Gangster Film ever. And Arguably the greatest movie of all time. 10 out of 10."
"1751","The Godfather",10,"This is what i call a MOVIE","This is one of the best movies i have ever seen,the way they directed it was really good and actors have performed very well in their own characters"
"1752","The Godfather",10,"Great movie","Great movie. This is the type of movie you just want to watch time and time again. A real classic."
"1753","The Godfather",9,"What is there to say?","Does it even need to be said that The Godfather is an amazing film? Is there really any purpose at all in pointing out all the things which make it so wonderful? Everybody knows. Everybody will always know. This is a film which will live forever. The story, the performances, the cinematography, the music...all so perfect. And all woven together so wonderfully by director Francis Ford Coppola who created a true classic.There are so very many good reasons why this film will always be remembered so fondly. No matter how many times you see it the film never fails to make an impact. Even if you've seen the film so often you essentially have it memorized line for line and shot for shot it remains a thrilling experience. From the famous opening scene with Marlon Brando's Don Vito Corleone receiving requests for favors on the occasion of his daughter's wedding all the way to the end and the final settling of all family business the film never lets up. It's an undeniably powerful story and one which retains the capacity to surprise. Because initially it seems obvious that the story is about Don Vito Corleone. He is the Godfather after all. But, for as powerful a presence as Brando is, as the story plays itself out there comes the moment where you realize this is the story of Don Vito's son Michael, as played so wonderfully by Al Pacino. When Michael comes into his own the film, gripping from the start, becomes even more compelling. Has any character in any film evolved more than Michael Corleone does here? The Michael we meet at his sister's wedding bears no resemblance to the man we see in the end. And what a performance by Pacino, changing along with his character. What a journey it is for Michael as his story unfolds. And it is quite a ride as well for us who have the privilege of seeing it.Brando and Pacino are the headliners but they are wonderfully supported by an amazing cast which includes the likes of James Caan, Robert Duvall, Diane Keaton and Al Lettieri. And that is just scratching the surface. There are so many memorable characters. And what a world Coppola has created for these characters to inhabit. The film has a unique look and feel to it. The world of The Godfather is quite unlike any other, often imitated but never duplicated. It's a triumph in every sense for Coppola. But perhaps his biggest success is in making you sympathize with the Corleones. We know right from the start that Don Vito Corleone is a man capable of doing monstrous things. But we identify with him anyway. And one cannot help but feel for Michael as he is inexorably pulled into the family business.Everyone has their favorite Godfather characters, favorite moments, favorite lines. The film has become a cultural touchstone. And as it continues to be discovered by new generations it seems that the film, if possible, actually continues to grow in stature. It is a classic film which stands the test of time. The Godfather has earned its place of honor in the history of film. A true masterpiece."
"1754","The Godfather",6,"Count Me In The Minority","First I have to say that it is very difficult to watch this movie for the first time (which I just did) and approach it with an open mind. The glowing reviews it gets everywhere (many of course calling it the best movie ever made) gives one extremely high expectations and the possibility of being easily disappointed. The many parodies of the movie also give it a cult status that makes one think one knows the story even if one has never seen it.I thought ""The Godfather"" was a good movie, but nothing more than that really. I personally wouldn't call it the greatest movie ever made; not even one of the greatest. It was good, worth watching once and I'm glad I've finally seen it, but nothing more.The portrayal of mob life in the post-war era seemed realistic enough, and the appropriate atmosphere was set. The opening scenes (revolving around Don Corleone's daughter's wedding) gave me mixed feelings. I thought the whole thing went on too long, but it did demonstrate that Corleone's ""business"" never ended - he was constantly meeting with various people looking for favours rather than being front and centre at the wedding. Brando, of course, won (and refused to accept) the Oscar for Best Actor for his portrayal of Corleone, but I wasn't actually taken with his performance. First, I really didn't think of him as the Lead Actor. Al Pacino (as Corleone's son Mike) was, I thought, far more important to the story and far more interesting to watch. Brando had - to me - an almost cartoonish aura around him. Over-rated in my view. But Pacino was excellent, and the character of Mike the most interesting in the movie, as he evolves from the returned war hero who wants nothing to do with the family ""business"" to the eventual ""Don.""It's not that I thought this was a bad movie. It was quite watchable and for the most part very interesting. I just think I've seen better.6/10"
"1755","The Godfather",10,"A Potpourri of Vestiges Review: A cinematic magnum opus","The Godfather is an extravaganza, nigh flawless, a cinematic magnum opus, ubiquitously acclaimed for its brilliance and for being in a league of its own. The Godfather doesn't depict poetic justice but rather portrays the triumph of perspicacious potency over abject vulnerability. The Godfather is known, not for its cogency but for its eloquence. The movie being star-studded is decorated with a plethora of supernal performances and it won't be a hyperbole that almost every actor gave an Oscar worthy performance. Marlon Brando is exceptionally brilliant in his sterling portrayal of Vito Corleone and so is Al Pacino in his remarkable portrayal of Michael Corleone. The grandeur of Don Vito Corleone ironically lies in his austerity and inexorable equanimity.The grandiosity of the movie is such, that even the biggest complement made about it may sound like a picayune remark. The Godfather may most aptly be described as an obituary of humanity, a requiem of mankind, owing to the pervasive violence and the brutality that it portrays in an utmost sanguinary fashion. In a nutshell, the movie has transcended all the limits of mortality only to achieve apotheosis.http://www.apotpourriofvestiges.com/"
"1756","The Godfather",10,"Best film ever made","As an Films Studies student from London. Watching this film was one of the most exciting thrill that ever happened to me. The powerful use of script and the Cinematography used to shoot the scenes were perfect and powerful. The first sequence of the film grips the audiences attention that this is not about brutal murders or shooting people without reason but involves discipline and symbolises the role played by Vito Corleone as being like a senator or a president when people come to help. I have watched this film more than 20 times and still don't get bored of it. If you want to compare it with Citizen Cane or Scarface, you can't. Because its too artistic and a perfect film for a gangster/crime hybrid film. When Al Pacino's role changes the film creates more suspense and concern on how he would run the family, but everyone then believes in him and he then becomes the next Godfather.This film is one of the best film ever to be made. Perfect in the way it starts and subsequently the ending as well, if you haven't watch this film didn't understand the concept of it, then don't bother watching films. This is the best film ever to be made...10/10"
"1757","The Godfather",10,"It is good","This movie is often considered the best ever. And it lives to the hype, everyone should see this movie at some point. The Hollywood at its best, with some money and advice taken in from the mob itself. A classic."
"1758","The Godfather",10,"The best movie by far.","So at first I always heard from a lot of people when I was younger that Godfather was the most epic movie of all time, I always memorized Vito Corleone's face when I was a kid... Years later I decided it's time I watch this movie and I did it on Netflix. Oh, and when I did, it was so good...The sharp chemistry is what makes up most of the stuff, these actors always just transcend and transcend so much. Vito Corleone is one of the best movie characters ever. And the performances? These actors gave one of the best performances of all time. Al Pacino as Michael Corleone is arguably his best performance ever. I can't say enough of Marlon Brando. Do I need to state the obvious? He is the best for a reason. I would go on forever on Godfather and why it is my favourite movie of all time, but that would be more than 1,000 words. If you haven't watched this, give it a try and see to yourself - a masterpiece.What ALSO makes the godfather so special is it's line of who is a hero and a villain, can one really call a calm guy like Vito Corleone a bad guy? Technically he should be because, well because.. He is, a good... bla bla bla, it all just goes into your mind and it challenges you. I always saw Vito as a hero, but as Godfather grew more on me, I thought he was more like an Anti-hero. As for Michael, he will always be an anti hero in my opinion. Godfather gives out the most blend and epic characters in fiction history ever, let alone movies."
"1759","The Godfather",9,"Allow ""The Godfather"" to make you an offer you can't refuse","""The Godfather"" has long enjoyed a reputation as one of the greatest films of all time. Is that a fair assessment? After re-watching the film recently, I'd say yes.The 'godfather' of the title is Don Vito Corleone (Marlon Brando), the aging head of the Corleone crime family. His time is coming to an end and some of his rivals would like to precipitate that end. When an attempt is made on the Don's life his sons follow in their father's footsteps as they seek to silence their enemies and protect the family interests.The Oscar-winning script was co-written by director Francis Ford Coppola and Mario Puzo, the author of the original novel. While trimmed significantly from the novel the film still clocks in at two hours and forty-five minutes. The film progresses at a stately pace and features countless classic scenes.Coppola's direction received a well-deserved Oscar nomination and so did Nino Rota's score (at least until it was deemed ineligible). Gordon Willis' cinematography is good (but not great) and the film's evocation of the 40's & 50's is both attractive and authentic.As for the actors, Marlon Brando was rewarded with his second Best Actor Oscar for his iconic portrayal of Vito Corleone. Al Pacino was nearly as good in his role as Vito's youngest son but he had to settle for a nomination in the supporting category. He had good company, though, since James Caan and Robert Duvall were also nominated. Any one of these three performances would have been Oscar-worthy. There were also several memorable performances in smaller roles from the likes of John Cazale, Talia Shire, Sterling Hayden and others.Is ""The Godfather"" the best American film of all time? Personally, I don't think so but I wouldn't rank it too far from the top. In any case, this is one of those films that every movie lover should see."
"1760","The Godfather",10,"Truly a Masterpiece","This movie was everything a good movie should be. I got The Godfather box set last Christmas (I had already watched the series about 20 times by then) and I watched it honestly about 3 weeks straight after getting it. This movie however is hands-down my favorite of the series. The story was amazing, and sure made Mafia life look like paradise. I loved the characters, all of them, even the antagonists were unforgettable. Everything looked authentic 1940's style, there weren't any slip-ups as far as I can tell. Marlon Brando, Al Pacino, James Caan, Robert Duvall, John Cazale all make a very authentic looking, and truly remarkable family. I was a huge Godfather encyclopedia for a while, I knew 95% of the characters and everything, and its easy to see why, this is a very memorable movie in every aspect. I loved this film at first sight. I read some of the ""Hated it"" comments, and they all say its boring or something. Those people need to grow up, if you want an action movie watch Die Hard or something, this movie is a classic and if those people lack the taste for good movies to watch it they need to take their hate of it elsewhere. This is a perfect movie and deserves a 10/10. Watch this if you want a truly unforgettable experience."
"1761","The Godfather",10,"#2 on IMDb's Top 100, a multi-Oscar-winner and over 1500 reviews...what more can I say about the movie?!","Up until today, I haven't bothered to review ""The Godfather"". After all, everyone pretty much knows it's one of the greatest films ever made. It's #2 on IMDb's Top 100. It won the Best Picture Oscar. And, there are nearly 1600 reviews on IMDb. So what's one more review?! Well, after completing 14,000 reviews (because I am nuts), I guess it's time I got around to reviewing a film I should have reviewed a long time ago. So, here goes....the film is perfect and only a dope wouldn't watch it. Unfortunately, IMDb requires me to say more to meet it's 10 line minimum for reviews. So, I'll point out that you do NOT need to like gangster films to enjoy this film. Yes, it's violent and nasty in spots--but it's also brilliantly written and produced from start to finish and deserves the accolades it's received.My advice is that instead of just watching ""The Godfather"" and ""The Godfather: Part II"", see the combined version they created for television--with additional scenes that made it a very rich experience."
"1762","The Godfather",9,"The best movie ever? Nah, an entertaining film? Yes.","I bought The Godfather: The Game and was sucked so deeply into it that I wanted to see the movies. My brother kept telling me about how the scenes in the movie played out and that alone was enough to make me buy the entire collection on DVD. I will never regret that decision so long as I live.The Godfather plays out like a documentary with out the corny voice over. The actors in this movie do such a great job it feels as though you aren't watching a movie but are instead watching the individual lives play out. There isn't a plot that can be fingered out. If you had to it would be the war between all the families and the cause of it.Don Vito Corleone is approached by a member of the Tattaglia family to form a deal between the two families in a new business venture: the selling of drugs. Don Corleone, a vigilant believer in the old ways, feels that getting into the business of drugs will draw too much heat. And because of this he refuses the offer that is placed before him.This fuels a fire with the Tattaglia family and it has a domino effect that causes wars between all of the families. The movie revolves around this central premise and comes to a head with the ending of the war. The outcome and what ends the war is also unpredictable and full of strategic writing. And I feel that the ending will surprise any body who doesn't already know how it all does.The only reason I didn't give this movie a 10/10 is because although it is a very entertaining and among the best movies I've ever seen, I don't feel that it is THEE best. There are movies out there that will entertain all audiences and that are just as good. There are movies that I can watch with friends without them growing bored. It gets a 9 because, as much as I love this movie, I can admit that it will only entertain a certain kind of person. I know there are movies that don't have this restriction.A definite must buy for collectors; Make sure you like dramatic movies and not action movies though."
"1763","The Godfather",7,"Very Average Film. Very Overrated","Marlon Brando's acting as the Godfather is sublime and this film is worth watching for that.However I did find the film very long-winded and at times boring. I liked the slow progression of the storyline and understand why Francis Ford Coppola did the film in the way he did. It's just that I felt the film was lacking something. It could have done with a bit more excitement or suspense to make the film more gripping.Lets just say I watched this film about a year ago and I still haven't seen The Godfather 2, and I am in no hurry to either.7/10. Average film. Worth watching to say that you have seen it."
"1764","The Godfather",10,"A must watch especially with director's commentary","Excellent film, from the opening to the end you sense a genuine touch into lives of the characters and the world created by the actors and Coppola.Just the intro of the movie immediately reveals the world you've entered and in the next few scenes you familiarized with family which shows who they are at heart.Personally, I love a movie that takes the time to deliver a well told story and The Godfather does just that - the scenes revealing the inner struggles of the characters, the conflict in matters regarding their world, and how each character deals with issues is well done.When a movie makes all their scenes have significant impact so much so that you don't find yourself wanting to pick favorites, you know you're dealing with greatness.From beginning to end I was immersed, and if you like well done movies I'm sure you'll experience the same."
"1765","The Godfather",10,"Filming of Horse's Head Scene","I was present when the filming of the Horse's head scene was done. I was a Police Officer in 1970 for the Nassau County Police Department, New York. I believe in the mid part of 1971, I was assigned, along with about 10 other officers and a Sergeant, to be at the Guggenheim Estate, Sands Point, Nassau County, NY. This estate was County property. The filming of the Horse's head scene and the dining room scene where Robert Duvall requests John Marley to give a film/singing role to one of the Don's relatives. Marley declines Duvall as you see a horse prancing in the meadow outside. Duvall says he will tell the Don in NY. Marley shrugs off Duvall. I was within 50' of both scenes. Coppola actually used real heads of horses ( they were shipped in ice in huge crates, they mixed a blood concoction). Coppola actually was very picky about the head he wanted to use. When Marley opens the sheet and discovers the head, it looks like sunrise. It was actually raining outside, and yellow cellophane was put on the windows. With the proper lighting, it looks like the sun was coming up, yet it was raining outside. The scene of the horse prancing outside was done at another location. The Guggenheim family were very rich and had art collections, etc throughout the mansion. The police were there to safeguard any of these collections. My girlfriend (now wife of over 41 years) was away at college. Banks of phones were set up. I was on the phone talking for a long time each of the three or four days assigned there. I was young and did not realize the assignment that I was on would be so important in the movie world. There were plenty of staff, extras, etc there. We were there for over 10/12 hours per day. Meals were catered. I also was assigned on traffic sometime later near the toll booth scene, filmed out on the old Mitchel Field Air Base. If you look close, at the toll booth, yellow parking lines are on the ground. Lindbergh, a friend of Guggenheim, flew from nearby Roosevelt Field. Somewhere in my attic, is my police memo book with exact dates when assigned as a ""rookie"" to the making of ""The Godfather"". Well, I guess I said enough, contact me if you need any more information. BTW, I retired in 2003, 33 year career. I became a supervisor in 1987 and was assigned to several movie filming on the ""Gold Coast"" of Long Island. One was the new version of ""Sabrina"", starring Harrison Ford....PS I never saw Marlon Brando, I think other scenes were done in Staten Island, part of NYC....thanks..."
"1766","The Godfather",10,"a classic when first released; only improves with age","The first words in Francis Coppola's organized crime saga (""I believe in America"") are spoken by a wronged father seeking justice from Mafia Don Vito Corleone, and with an immigrant's passion invoke the spirit of his adapted homeland. It's an ironic gesture in a film which embraces the American Dream with a vengeance, beginning with a joyful celebration of marriage, ending with a solemn Catholic Church baptism, and continuing in between with murder after bloody murder: for vengeance; for punishment; or (with a severed horse head under the bed sheets) simply for leverage. The film gained notoriety for such epic displays of gangland violence, but its real power lies in nuance: a shading of phrase; a deceptive fall of lamplight; the sound of footsteps on a hospital stairway. Credit goes to co-writers Coppola and Mario Puzo for the leisurely paced but tightly plotted screenplay, by itself a remarkable study in contrasts, showing the thin line dividing patriotism and graft; honor and brutality; family affections and ritual violence. Seeing Part One independent from its companion/sequel is like reading only the middle chapters of a long and complex historical novel, rich in detail and drama, about an immigrant family coping with changing times in the New World. The result is one of the few truly effective adaptations of a popular novel, and together with Part Two perhaps the last word in gangster film dramas."
"1767","The Godfather",9,"A bit long, but at least there's quality as well as quantity","Part of the reason that The Godfather has been so popular, is that on first viewing it really does seem to have something for everyone.  It's a thriller, it's a (fascinating) documentary on 'Mafia Code', and half way through, for 45 minutes, a tragic love story.For starters, the acting is sensational.  There are very few people on Earth that cannot identify Marlon Brando's whispering, horse voice and bulldog expression. It has become what is probably the most famous performance in Hollywood's history.  The appearance of Al Pacino in the starring role is also a highlight.  The other highlights are of course the 'sound bytes'. For anyone who has not scene this masterpiece, I will not give the more famous quotes away- but they will be instantly recognisable when heard.This movie is split into three parts- the crime of the family, and its consequences, the exile of Pacino, and the reunion of the family in which the characters carry out the parts of the plot which set us up for the sequel.My only criticism of this film is how long winded it is.  Virtually three hours long, it is so meticulous that it becomes very hard to digest.  While the sequel is very deep and thoughtful, this tries to balance intellect and action- and although to a certain extent it succeeds, you wonder if this film would be a more enjoyable experience if there was less discussion and plot details, and a few more thrills."
"1768","The Godfather",9,"A little over rated, but I know good film making when I see it","I did get a little bored here and there. But this film is classic. A work of art that will be remembered forever, and I admire the acting. It's so wonderful and you see so many familular faces that you see today. I will never forget ""The Godfather"".9/10"
"1769","The Godfather",9,"This was an Awesome movie which i ever watched in my life","First time i saw this movie i did not understand the actual realty of movie and characters acting was speech less. Rest i can said when i saw and understand this movie after my 5th 100% successful attempt to watch full movie then i realize this was the awesome movie i need to buy original, and well be in my personal collection . Currently my family and my friends also buy the original blue ray of this movie very hard to find a seller because all want this one to their collection part.fabulous acting, superb story and played with characters am speechless. We all knows we well not again see to like this kind of level of movie in any decades hats off to all super actors in the movie."
"1770","The Godfather",10,"Amazing Movie","This movie is directed wonderfully. Dialogs are good. You don't even know how 3 hours are passed away. Al Pacino's acting takes movie to whole another level. The good news is that The Godfather has many amazing qualities, including fantastic performances, unprecedented visuals and very engaging stories. The bad news is that this should have easily been a 10, but overall, it is so sprawling and unfocused that I can't possibly give it more than a 9, which it only earns because the assets transcend what's basically a mess overall.Although all of the cinematography and production design is great, what really impressed me were some of the darkly lit scenes. Characters and features of sets emerge from pitch-blackness, and everything is rich, deep shades of burgundy, brown, and orange. Amazingly, nothing gets lost in these scenes."
"1771","The Godfather",10,"Great movies are not born great, they are made great.","I have rated over a 100 movies in IMDb and none of them could get a 10/10 score, but this. I think that perfect score was waiting for me to watch this movie. This movie that has set a benchmark for me to rate other movies, ""Is it The Godfather level good or not ?"".This movie for me is an epitome of perfection, it scores a perfect score in almost all the departments, be it direction, acting, music, screenplay, character development, cinematography etc. I just couldn't find a fault with it (and mind you I tried really hard).With a blazing canon of actors which include Marlon Brando, Al Pacino, James Caan, Robert Duvall this film pierces right through you and makes a place for itself. Even days after you watch this movie you will find yourself, in your own private moments, speaking out those wonderful lines, trying to copy Vito Corleone or shape your voice like Michael Corleone. In its own mysterious ways the movie will sure remain with you.It leaves you wanting more, not because there are questions that remain unanswered, but because this film feels so good that you never want to leave it, leave the streets of New York or the Godfather's mansion. All in all Francis Ford Coppola has done a remarkable job that, in the least, deserves a standing ovation and an unanimous cheer of ""Bravo!"". This movie leaves you with an aftertaste of knowing that you have cherished watching an excellent movie."
"1772","The Godfather",10,"Review","The few ""perfect"" films to ever been released are so perfect in every aspect that each scene almost feels like a masterpiece on its own. In the case of Coppola's revolutionary The Godfather, this statement holds especially true. Phenomenal and sheer brilliance in every aspect that cannot be matched by modern ""cinema"", Coppola's The Godfather is cinematic perfection in every aspect of filmmaking. From performances delivered by an astounding ensemble cast, to Nina Rota's breathtakingly soaring and epic musical score to Coppola's very direction, The Godfather should essentially be viewed as a three hour masterclass on filmmaking for any aspiring filmmakers. So perfect in every aspect and so free of flaws, no film since its time has matched even half the brilliance of The Godfather."
"1773","The Godfather",10,"Masterpiece","It's hard to find a moment in the film that isn't great. The Godfather lives up to the term masterpiece. A defining film in the history of cinema, ""The Godfather"" introduced a legendary filmmaker and several acting greats in the telling of an Italian American dynasty undone by the tragic circumstances of their criminal exploits. ""The Godfather"" is highly regarded as the greatest American movie of all-time. No other movie has garnered such praise as this movie has. Undoubtedly, everything has been meticulously put together to create an entertaining, captivating, and phenomenal masterpiece. Starring the best actor of all times (this movie can prove it), Marlon Brando, the rebellious prodigy, who electrified a generation and forever transformed the art of screen acting.You can't miss this movie."
"1774","The Godfather",10,"Look how they massacred my boy","The Godfather is an endless movie. No matter the age in which it has been discovered or the number of times you have seen it, this is a work that does not lose its ability to fascination and mystery. The problem is how to talk about it not limited to the amount of praise that his expertise justifies either the wonderful performance of Brando as Don Vito Corleone is evoked (note modulation of dialogues and play with the cat in the three interviews of the first sequence: all his character is defined), the tormented role Pacino as Michael Corleone (is a war hero who works they require to take their place in the crime family), the impulsive character of James Caan, with its counterpart in reflective Tom Hagen who plays Robert Duvall or accuracy of the smallest side, corresponding to names as Italian as Sollozzo and Tattaglia.The ribbon structure wise, it does not feel his nearly three hours, is also exemplary. It could be considered that The Godfather is organized around collective sequences religious-family: marriage of Connie (the only sunny sequence of the film to the Sicilian intermediate achieved), the justly celebrated baptism-slaughter, disease and death (the Don Vito was playing with his grandson among the vines, is another anthology moment) and the rest comes down to await the arrival of the violence, unrelenting brutality from the shooting of Sonny at the foot of the house (a tribute Coppola to Arthur Penn's Bonnie & Clyde) to the ""premiere"" of Michael in the restaurant. There riddled bodies, stabbed, dismembered, strangled or blunt: a kind of feast of degraded meat, without which there is no mafia ""order."""
"1775","The Godfather",10,"A genre-defining masterpiece","New York, 1945. Don Vito Corleone (played by Marlon Brando) is the aging Godfather of a mafia family. He has three sons - Sonny (James Caan), Fredo (John Cazale) and Michael (Al Pacino). Sonny is his natural successor but is impulsive, short-tempered and not much of a thinker. Fredo is overly passive. Michael is a war hero and looking to stay out of the family business. The Corleone family and the other four mafia families of New York and New Jersey have been at peace for several years now. Then one of the families decides to get into the illegal narcotics business and wants Don Corleone's help. Don Corleone decides that his family should stay out of narcotics. This has disastrous and far-reaching consequences, consequences that will suck Michael deeper and deeper into the family business. Hard to come up with any more superlatives for this movie, as it is rightfully regarded as one of the greatest movies of all time. Great story, based on the book by Mario Puzo and adapted by Puzo and Francis Ford Coppola. Superb direction by Coppola - some wonderful moments of sensitivity and great drama scenes. Despite being nearly three hours long it doesn't feel like it at all. The movie is very well paced and there's always something happening. Coppola sucks you in from the word go and keeps you enthralled and engaged the whole time.Excellent performances too. Marlon Brando well deserved his Best Actor Oscar, as did Al Pacino, Robert Duvall and James Caan their nominations for Best Supporting Actor. The movie launched Pacino's career and revitalised Brando's. Beyond the pure art and entertainment of the movie, it defined, and set the benchmark for, the gangster-drama. There had been gritty crime-dramas before. In the 1930s and 40s we had several excellent James Cagney movies (White Heat from 1949 being the pick of the bunch), as well as the original Scarface and other crime dramas. In the 1940s and 50s there were some great film noir dramas. However, none of these had the grittiness, profundity and sheer breadth and depth of story of The Godfather. So monumental its influence can be seen in the works of Scorsese (Goodfellas, especially), Tarantino, many other directors and, most overtly, the excellent TV series The Sopranos. An all-time classic."
"1776","The Godfather",10,"Best Movie Ever.","The Godfather movie series is the best that I have ever seen. It's really joy and fun and exciting to watch the movie all over again. I really enjoy the first part the most, but I think the second part is very interesting and adds lots of elements to part one. I wish the Godfather was a whole new TV series, that dose extend beyond three parts. I enjoy the excellent acting, story, and drama. I can't say enough about the music. It's something that many people enjoy listening to on regular bases. Overall I would rank this movie top notch on my list. Highly recommended. have seen The Godfather movies too many times to count. It's part of the lexicon in my family, we quote lines from it all the time in regular conversation. So, I thought this book might be a little boring, just because I already knew the story so well. Not the case! The book adds so much detail to the story that I think I'll be watching the movie again soon in a whole new light. Joe Mantegna does such a wonderful job narrating this story and I'd absolutely recommend his version as opposed to the other full cast version that's out there, especially for people that are really in tune with the movie."
"1777","The Godfather",10,"The Best","The movie is phenomenal, is rightly considered one of the greatest films ever made. The Godfather continues to influence producers of films, television shows, and video games more than 40 years after its release. It takes its subjects seriously, bestowing legitimacy upon the internecine power struggles of the Mafia normally reserved for classical themes in high art. There is something deeply resonant in the film's treatment of filial piety, the need for respect, and our culture's abiding interest in the parallel moral universe of the Mafia. Just the best."
"1778","The Godfather",10,"Movie , which is unparalleled .","Rarely can it be said that a film has defined a genre, but never is that more true than in the case of The Godfather. Since the release of the 1972 epic (which garnered ten Academy Award nominations and was named Best Picture), all ""gangster movies"" have been judged by the standards of this one (unfair as the comparison may be). If a film is about Jewish mobsters, it's a ""Jewish Godfather""; if it's about the Chinese underworld, it's an ""Oriental Godfather""; if it takes place in contemporary times, it's a ""modern day Godfather"".If The Godfather was only about gun-toting Mafia types, it would never have garnered as many accolades. The characteristic that sets this film apart from so many of its predecessors and successors is its ability to weave the often-disparate layers of story into a cohesive whole. Any of the individual issues explored by The Godfather are strong enough to form the foundation of a movie. Here, however, bolstered by so many complimentary themes, each is given added resonance. The picture is a series of mini-climaxes, all building to the devastating, definitive conclusion.Rarely does a film tell as many diverse-yet-interconnected stories. Strong performances, solid directing, and a tightly-plotted script all contribute to The Godfather's success. This motion picture was not slapped together to satiate the appetite of the masses; it was carefully and painstakingly crafted. Every major character - and more than a few minor ones - is molded into a distinct, complex individual. Stereotypes did not influence Coppola's film, although certain ones were formed as a result of it."
"1779","The Godfather",10,"Best movie of all time","One of the best movies I have ever see, and I love it everything about this movie. Nothing in this movie is too much, every scene in the movie is perfect. The movie is with best cast ever, best directing, good story. It is about crime, family and their relationship. The best thing about it is that movie don't have any flaw. The best way to describe it is with word MASTERPIECE. When movie is in parts I, II ... often only first part is good and others bad, but it is not case with this movie. It's 40 years old movie, and still one of the best, I thing that information tells a lot. Don't miss this movie, because most of you will watch it again and again. :D"
"1780","The Godfather",10,"Francis Ford Coppola's Epic Classic Masterpice","The Godfather (1972) is Francis Ford Coppola's epic classic masterpiece and is one of the best crime films in the world that it ever was made. It is my favorite best film and I will always watch it. None of the movies like are The Godfather didn't make or did a job well done like Mario Puzo's The Godfather. The Godfather is a 1972 film about a Mafia crime family and the outbreak of a New York City gang war in the late 1940s. One of the original ""Movie Brats"" who had not had a hit after seven films, director Coppola collaborated on the epic film's screenplay with Mario Puzo who had written a best-selling novel of the same name about a Mafia dynasty (the Corleones). The Godfather catapulted Francis Ford Coppola to directorial superstardom, and popularized the following euphemistic phrase (of brutal coercion): ""I'm gonna make him an offer he can't refuse."" I love this film to death! Marlon Brando's performance is one of his best, the acting in here is superb and awesome. Marlon Brando's the most memorable character. The only two films that he later made were Superman (1978) and Apocalypse Now (1979) that were a major hit in the box office. He never made in to making any sequels so those three films are his brilliant performances that are known today. Al Pacino played Michael Corleone superb and brilliant. I love that this film is set in In late summer 1945 and shows how the history really was. When the aging head of a famous crime family decides to transfer his position to one of his subalterns, a series of unfortunate events start happening to the family, and a war begins between all the well-known families leading to insolence, deportation, murder and revenge, and ends with the favorable successor being finally chosen. The Best of the best film of the world I love it!!!! The superb, three-part gangster saga was inaugurated with this film from Italian-American director Francis Ford Coppola, The Godfather (1972). The first two parts of the lush and grand saga are among the most celebrated, landmark films of all time. Many film reviewers consider the second part equal or superior to the original, although the first part was a tremendous critical and commercial success - and the highest grossing film of its time. This mythic, tragic film contributed to a resurgence in the American film industry, after a decade of competition from cinema abroad.Francis Ford Coppola's epic features Marlon Brando in his Oscar-winning role as the patriarch of the Corleone family. Director Coppola paints a chilling portrait of the Sicilian clan's rise and near fall from power in America, masterfully balancing the story between the Corleone's family life and the ugly crime business in which they are engaged. Based on Mario Puzo's best-selling novel and featuring career-making performances by Al Pacino, James Caan and Robert Duvall, this searing and brilliant film garnered ten Academy Award nominations, and won three including Best Picture of 1972. (Paramount Pictures) The Godfather is a 1972 American crime film directed by Francis Ford Coppola and produced by Albert S. Ruddy from a screenplay by Mario Puzo and Coppola. Starring Marlon Brando and Al Pacino as the leaders of the fictional Corleone New York crime family, the story spans the years 1945-55, concentrating on the transformation of Michael Corleone from reluctant family outsider to ruthless Mafia boss while chronicling the family under the patriarch Vito.Definitely one of the best crime gangster movie of all time. The movie that changed the history forever! Francis Ford Coppola's direction was superb and fantastic, not even that he shot with camera scenes that is impossible to lost. The film has character development, a terrific cast and awesome epic scenes that I love. Talia Shire as Connie Corleone did a wonderful fantastic job as Michael's Sister and Vito's daughter.

"1781","The Godfather",10,"The Mona Liza of Motion Pictures art","Greetings from Lithuania.To call ""The Godfather"" a masterpiece or a classic would be underestimating. This is simply put, one of the very best (if not the best) motion pictures ever created. I saw this movie 3 or 4 times, and i never get tired of it. After some time passes, you kinda feel a need to revisit it again.There isn't anything new that i could say about this picture that wasn't said before countless times. Everything works here on such level, that it creates this rich, deep and unforgettable world. From whole trilogy, Part 1 is my favorite by a mile. 2nd and 3rd movies are great in their own terms, but first one is another level.Acting, directing, writing, music (the music!), set design - it's a thing of beauty and admiration to a movie crafting art.Overall, because you have probably already have seen this masterpiece, I can only recommend it to not forget it for a long time and revisit it once in a while. It contains everything that an educated cinema-goer can wish. The unforgettable and one of the kind motion picture, which probably like a great wine just keeps getting better with years."
"1782","The Godfather",10,"""Leave the gun. Take the cannoli.""","The Godfather, for the few of you who don't already know, is about the Corleone mafia family struggling to survive a war with a rival family. That's about as simplistic a summary as you can get for this masterpiece. There's no way to describe it in a few simple lines and there's already a ton of excellent, well-thought-out reviews here on IMDb. There's really very little I can add to the overwhelming praise for this film. It's obviously one of the greatest movies of all time and its reputation as such is well-deserved. The direction, the cast, the score, the script are as good as it gets. The whole production is as flawless as you're likely to find on any film. There isn't a thing about it I would change. It's one of those movies you have to see at least once before you die."
"1783","The Godfather",NA,"Filmmaking At Its Most Perfect, Genuine, Complete, Crystalline & Pure.","Immortal for its contribution to cinema & one of the prime examples of filmmaking art, The Godfather is a remarkable inside-out look at the life of a mafia family that also paints an astounding portrait of organised crime. Scoring full marks in all aspects of filmmaking, be it direction, screenplay, acting, cinematography, editing or music, this crime drama immerses viewers into its world from the very beginning and narrates its story with such strong magnetic grip for the next three hours that it's impossible to not be impressed & amazed by it. Even after so many viewings, there is nothing to complain about this classic, there is no weakness to exploit and with each view, the respect for this motion picture masterpiece only gets higher.Based on the novel of the same name by Mario Puzo, The Godfather tells the story of the Corleone family, a respectable & powerful family having major underworld influences which are overseen by Don Vito Corleone, who is termed as Godfather by his peers as a token of respect. But when Don Corleone refuses to enter the drug business, a series of events are set in motion which results in an assassination attempt on the Don, increasing rivalries among the mafia families, and paves way for Don's youngest son to rise & take up his father's job in order to protect his family and to settle all disputes. The film revolves around Michael Corleone (Don's youngest son) and even the main plot of the story is the evolution of Michael from a doe-eyed outsider, who didn't want to get into the family business, into a ruthless boss later in the story.The direction by Francis Ford Coppola is no short of amazement. The way he filmed most of the scenes from the very beginning to the end, the casting decisions he made, the chosen locations for shooting, the remarkable screenplay & memorable quotes co-written with Mario Puzo and the overall style of narration & look of the film, it's all brilliantly done. Cinematography is carried out beautifully and the decision to shoot in Technicolor print pays off enormously well for it provided this film a vintage look that wonderfully matched the timeline it represented and also added an artistic flair to the whole medium. Editing is very precisely done with each character getting enough time on-screen without robbing its expertly controlled pace. Nino Rota's score opens the film with a sad, almost funeral-like theme music, and boasts tracks which sound very unusual for a crime drama but then it also fits the film's ambiance remarkably well. The overall work by the entire technical crew is as much responsible for this film's success as the direction, writing & performances.As far as performances go, The Godfather features a cast of incredibly gifted actors in Marlon Brando, James Caan, Al Pacino, Robert Duvall, John Cazale, Diane Keaton, Richard S. Castellano, Talia Shire, Al Lettieri & many more, and every one of them is in top-notch form. Marlon Brando makes Don Corleone truly his own, giving his character a set of unique look & traits and delivers, possibly, the greatest performance of all time which also immortalised the character of Don Corleone in cinema forever and permanently engraved Brando's status as one of world's finest actors. Al Pacino also makes his mark on the big stage and delivers the next great performance as Michael Corleone, plus his rise to power from a reluctant outsider into a ruthless mafia boss remains one of the most spectacular character arcs ever exhibited on film canvas. James Caan stars as Sonny Corleone, Don's hot-headed eldest son, and I don't recall Caan delivering any other performance of this calibre and same goes for Richard S. Castellano who plays Clemenza, a caporegime for the Corleone family. Other notable works include Robert Duvall as Tom Hagen, Diane Keaton as Kay Adams, Talia Shire as Connie Corleone, Abe Vigoda as Tessio & Al Lettieri as Virgil Sollozzo. All in all, there are no complains in this department either.Telling a tale that spans ten years of the Corleone family in three hours, while also reflecting the world of organised crime with immense character depth & complexity unlike anything before it, and ingeniously blending it with impressive direction, sturdy writing, impeccable performances, striking quotes, innovative storytelling & a mesmerizing score, The Godfather is an exceptionally well-made motion picture and certainly the one with the best cast. Ever since its release, it has become the benchmark by which all the great masterpieces are measured and its influence on cinema, especially gangster genre, is unprecedented. On an overall scale, The Godfather is universally accepted as one of world cinema's finest films, arguably the greatest ever, and the performances by Marlon Brando & Al Pacino alone are the stuff of legends. Plus, this films also marks a significant moment in cinema, in my opinion, in which the baton was passed from Marlon Brando, the finest actor of his generation, to Al Pacino who later became the finest actor of the subsequent era. The film doesn't need my recommendation because it's a must watch for every cinema lover. There are very few movies which are unanimously hailed as a great one from critics, filmmakers & viewers all around the world and The Godfather is unquestionably one of those classics and, in my opinion, the only one that deserves the top spot. A cinematic treasure you should neither refuse nor ignore, The Godfather is genre filmmaking at its most perfect, genuine, complete, crystalline & pure. One hundred percent recommended."
"1784","The Godfather",10,"The Don And His Sons","My nephew who is all of 17 told me in no uncertain terms that movie making with him starts with The Godfather. He doesn't believe anything made before it is of any great merit. For him The Godfather is like The Birth of a Nation. All three of The Godfather films can bear viewing over and over again. Mario Puzo created such compelling characters and Francis Ford Coppola brought them to life so vividly that you just get sucked in permanently. Like that other mammoth novel about a period, Gone With the Wind, Mario Puzo was like Margaret Mitchell in that there was no way he could top himself after the book was published.Anyone steeped in organized crime history will know a lot about who is being alluded to in all of the Godfather films. Case in point, Alex Rocco who plays the minor character of Moe Green who takes it upon himself to slap Fredo Corleone around. He's also got a cash flow problem at the casino he's running. One would have to have been living on another planet to not know he was referring to Bugsy Siegal.The Godfather story begins at the end of World War II where Marlon Brando rules the roost as Vito Corleone head of one of the large crime families. Two sons, James Caan (Sonny) and John Cazale (Fredo) are in the business and the third Al Pacino (Michael) has just come back from the war a decorated hero. The occasion is the gathering of the clan and friends for daughter Talia Shire (Connie) to Gianni Rizzi (Carlo Russo). All the characters are marvelously introduced and the plot situations laid out beautifully.Marlon Brando who apparently decided that what George C. Scott did was so good in refusing the Oscar for Patton decided to do him one better and send up a bogus Indian princess to tell why. Despite that bit of cheek Brando certainly deserved an Oscar for his performance. Don Vito is compelling as criminal and family man. Brando might have been lucky though in that Al Pacino who really is the main character in all three Godfather films was nominated in the Supporting Actor category.In fact Pacino was nominated with James Caan and Robert Duvall who plays Tom Heggen the family lawyer/consigliere and Brando's adopted son. That three way tie guaranteed the Oscar for Joel Grey in Cabaret with Eddie Albert being nominated for The Heartbreak Kid as the fifth. They're all great, but Pacino should have been in The Best Actor category.Singer Al Martino plays Johnny Fontaine who if you didn't know that this was Frank Sinatra again you'd have to have been living on another planet. In fact the identification is made complete by the fact that Martino sings I Have But One Heart at the Corleone wedding which was an early Sinatra hit. Sinatra was not happy with The Godfather and broke off relations with Martino and with Richard Conte who plays Don Barzini one of the other Mafia Dons. Part of the underside of the Sinatra legend is worked into the plot as well.The images and dialog of The Godfather have entered into our popular culture. The horse's head in John Marley's bed, the cryptic gangster dialog of speaking of an ""offer he can't refuse"", or ""Lucabrazzi sleeps with the fishes"" is all stuff we remember forever after seeing the film.The key scene I think in The Godfather is between the retired Brando and Pacino who has taken over the crime family. Brando isn't happy about the road he took for success, but it's what was available to him. He hoped that Pacino could have stayed out of the family business and had a clean life. It wasn't to be, but maybe the next generation. I think it's beautifully played.In fact it's all beautifully played."
"1785","The Godfather",9,"Oh, Those Corleones....","No American filmmaker has had a more disappointing trajectory to his film career than Francis Ford Coppola. To have directed four of the most influential films of the 70's (the first two ""Godfather"" films, ""The Conversation,"" and ""Apocalypse Now"") and then to spend the last two decades churning out one stinky product after another (""Peggy Sue Got Married,"" ""Bram Stoker's Dracula"", the third ""Godfather"") earns Coppola my award for Most Promising Director Who Most Miserably Failed at Establishing Himself as an Important Figure of American Cinema. But before ""Jack"" there was ""The Godfather."" While I feel the whole ""Godfather"" trilogy has been lauded into oblivion and is somewhat overrated, who am I to argue with the majority? People think these are great movies, and they've certainly implanted themselves permanently in our cultural consciousness.And don't get me wrong: these films have moments of greatness (at least the first two installments do). But I think ""The Conversation"" and ""Apocalypse Now"" are ultimately more interesting films, and I think Coppola stretched himself more artistically in those two films than he did in the entire ""Godfather"" trilogy combined.Of the trilogy, the first film is by far the best. It shows Coppola's flair for being able to craft a story with extreme mainstream appeal while staying faithful to his artistic vision. ""The Godfather"" doesn't look or sound quite like any gangster film before it, with it's muddy lighting and sound. It's also much more ambiguous morally than the usual Hollywood gangster film, at least any produced up to that point. The line between crime and justice is blurred sometimes beyond distinction, and the Corleone family at times acts with more honor (in its own way) than the institutions charged with upholding freedom, justice and morality. In this way, ""The Godfather"" offered a scathing critique of the foundations on which America as a country was built.Coppola, however, drives this point into the ground over the course of three films. There's really not much more to say after the first film (it's already apparent that Michael Corleone's style of rule is different from his father's, his coldness and ruthlessness necessitated by a changing time), but we have to sit through a nearly 3 1/2 hour second installment that does nothing but reiterate this point again and again. Part II at least is saved by the back story of Vito Corleone (played by Marlon Brando in Part I and Robert De Niro in Part II), and that story alone keeps Part II afloat. But Part III is wholly unnecessary and mars the whole enterprise, turning the franchise into the stuff of parody and camp.Al Pacino is the glue that holds the trilogy together, though his character really isn't as complex as a first viewing would have you believe. The major conflict facing him is resolved in the first film, and the second and third films give him nothing to do but replay what are essentially the same scenes over and over again.Other standouts in the cast include Robert Duvall, Diane Keaton and Talia Shire (who alone makes the third chapter worth watching).Obviously a must see for cinema buffs, or even casual fans, but don't feel you have to label this trilogy as great just because of the reputation that precedes it.My Grade--- Part I: A Part II: B Part III: C-"
"1786","The Godfather",10,"MASTERPIECE !","Great scenario, perfect fiction, very good acting... A complete masterpiece..."
"1787","The Godfather",10,"A masterpiece","Epic film about a Mafia family called the Corleones. It takes place from the 1940s to 1950s. The family is overseen by Don Corleone (Marlon Brando). His sons help their father...except for his youngest Michael (Al Pacino). He wants no part of the family business...but he might have no choice.A fantastic film. It runs three hours but you're never bored. It's wonderfully directed by Francis Ford Coppola. It also is one of those rare films with a perfect cast--no one is bad! It's also fun to see Pacino, James Caan, Robert Duvall and Diane Keaton so young and full of life. Many of the lines (""I'll make him an offer he can't refuse"") have become legendary. Also there is some violence which was considered extreme in 1972 but is pretty tame today. Only a character getting shoot at a toll booth is pretty over the top. My favorite scene has to be at the end when Keaton realizes what she's married into. The look on her face is perfect.This was a HUGE hit at the box office. It was loved by critics and the public alike. It was (rightfully) called the Gone With the Wind of the 1970s. A masterpiece and well worth seeing."
"1788","The Godfather",10,"Best Crime Movies Ever","The Godfather is a 1972 American crime film directed by Francis Ford Coppola and produced by Elbert Roddy and by Coppola and Mario Bozo, adapted from the same novel of 1969. The film starring Marlon Brando and Al Pacino as leaders of one of New York's most powerful crime families. The story stretches from 1945 to 1955, centered on the transformation of Michael Corleone (Al Pacino) from an ordinary person into a merciless mafia leader while also chronicling the Corleone family led by Vito Corleone (Marlon Brando).The Godfather is widely regarded as one of the greatest films in the world cinema and one of the most influential films, especially in gang films. The film is now in second place as the biggest film in American cinema (behind Kane) by the American Film Institute. The film was selected to be kept in the National Film Registry in 1990.He was the godfather for the highest-grossing films of all time, the highest income film of 1972."
"1789","The Godfather",10,"VERY good, but not the best...","...""The Godfather"", as everyone knows, is a classic.  It follows the Corleone family over a period of a few years in the forties.  It starts with godfather Vito Corleone (Marlon Brando) and ends with godfather - and Vito's son - Michael Corleone (Al Pacino).  Also involved are Sonny Corleone (James Caan), adopted son Tom Hagen (Robert Duvall) and muscle Peter Clemenza (Richard S. Castellano) to name a few.The acting ensemble is one of the greatest put together in film history. Brando plays the wise Vito Corleone very well, but the best performances come from Pacino as Michael and Caan as Sonny.  Pacino is probably the greatest character actor of all time, and this film shows it.  He plays Michael at the start with a young naivety and is able to bring the character along to the end of the film, where he shows the growth of Michael's knowledge and wisdom.  Unfortunately, Caan is only in about half the movie, but he certainly does an incredible job as the hot tempered Sonny.""The Godfather"" is the template for good drama.  Few films achieve it's greatness, but in the end, it is surely not the best.  In my opinion, there is no best movie of all time, but many 'best' films per genre.  ""The Godfather"" is the best crime drama.  ""Casablanca"" is the best romance.  ""The Lord of the Rings"" and ""Star Wars"" movies are the best adventures.  All of said movies would tie, and be equal in greatness.So, if you're ever tired of these days' mindless action and mediocre drama films, then pop in one of the classics.  Any one will do, they are all equally entertaining.  Films like ""The Godfather"", ""Casablanca"", ""Lord of the Rings"" and ""Star Wars"" are the reason movies are so popular.Enjoy, 9/10."
"1790","The Godfather",9,"not the godfather of all movies","As much as i did enjoy this film, and was intrigued throughout, I still don't like to see it gain the repetitive status of 'the greatest movie of all time'. I feel a movie has to have a more relevant context than the glamourised lifestyle and crooked dealings of Italian-American mafia to gain such a grand title. However, admittedly, unlike 'The Goodfellas' for instance, 'The godfather' is not glamourised that much, and I'm thankful for Coppolla turning what was at times a tedious book into a 3 hour long gripping tale. I did enjoy the book, but it's lucky that Coppolla was the man who got his hands on it. He turned some of 'The Godfather''s sections into the most mind-bendingly gripping scenes ever.In a film genre that is incredibly overrated, 'The Godfather' certainly stands head and shoulders above the rest, however, i feel it's genre should forever hold it back from being THE greatest movie of all time."
"1791","The Godfather",NA,"Monumental Film-Making and Arguably the Greatest Movie Ever.","""The Godfather"" is so smart, so well written (an Oscar winner for Best Adapted Screenplay) and so well performed that it would have succeeded under the very worst of circumstances. Marlon Brando (Oscar-winning, even though he refused the award) gives the performance of a lifetime as the head of a Mafia family that will do anything and everything to dominate organized crime in post-World War II New York City. However, the face of crime is quickly changing and other syndicates are targeting Brando to eliminate him as competition. What no one figured was that youngest son Al Pacino (Oscar-nominated) may be even more ruthless and maniacal than his father. Robert Duvall and James Caan both received Oscar nominations for their roles in the wicked mix. Diane Keaton, Talia Shire, Abe Vigoda and John Cazale all do arguably the best work of their respective careers. ""The Godfather"" is epic film-making which ended up being the first true picture to deal with the topic in a non-film noir style. It is an amazing achievement which is probably the best movie produced in the 1970s (that is saying a whole lot by the way) and quite possibly the greatest motion picture of all time. An excellent movie from every cinematic angle imaginable. 5 stars out of 5."
"1792","The Godfather",10,"A Thing of Perfection","From the opening credits, you become completely immersed in the world of the Godfather. One of this film's greatest strengths is the pure power of the culture surrounding it. When you watch it, you feel like the society and the people in have descended from generations of people who have been in the ""business"".The acting is nothing less than sensational and the music accentuates and complements the film beautifully.Not much else can be said of perfection.This film is a must-have for anyone who professes to watch movies and is a required viewing for cultural education."
"1793","The Godfather",10,"Everything you've ever heard is true...","THE GODFATHER is quite simply a masterful piece of film-making, an epic in the truest sense of the word and by far the finest gangster film ever shot. Made with finesse, style to spare and a director who elicits pitch-perfect performances from a talented cast, this is movie-making as it should be.Yes, it's a very long film and yes, some sections are quite slow. Nevertheless, none of the film is any less than riveting. The story - of a father/son takeover in one of New York's major Italian Mafia families - is fairly straight forward, and yet Francis Ford Coppola turns it into something else so much more; a meditation on the human condition, perhaps.Certainly this is a film that explores the darker side of humanity. Jealousy, betrayal, anger and revenge are all key themes here, and the film is inevitably punctuated by moments of graphic and shocking violence. And I'm glad Coppola chooses not to shy away from the said violence, which makes it all the more gritty and realistic when it does happen.Marlon Brando takes the showrunner role here, the patriarch who's past his prime, but it's easy to spot the real star of the piece: Al Pacino, who burns up the screen with sheer ferocity. Robert Duvall is easy to miss in a quieter part, but watch out for James Caan whose volatile Sonny is one of the film's most engaging characters. Altogether this is a splendid and unforgettable piece of film-making, which inevitably spawned sequels and a whole gamut of similar gangster fare, but THE GODFATHER towers head and shoulders above them all."
"1794","The Godfather",NA,"Simply a great classic, number one on many lists.","I was fortunate to see ""The Godfather"" back in 1972 upon its theatrical release. No matter how many ""gangster"" movies were made before this, here we had a different kind of movie. We had a movie foremost about ""family"" and dedication to one another. If you could manage to ignore the fact that this was one of the New York mafia families (set in the 1940s), it was as if we were watching a model family. At once honoring the family patriarch, Don Vito Corleone memorably played by Marlon Brando , and at the same time witnessing the rise of the new family leader, Michael Corleone played by Al Pacino. Equally memorable was the role of Santino 'Sonny' Corleone created by James Caan. And memorable for Robert Duvall who created the quiet role of Tom Hagen. Many list have ""The Godfather"" as number one of all time. To me that doesn't matter, films are meant to be enjoyed each for its own merit. Regardless, there probably will never be a ""gang family"" movie that approaches the overall impact of this one.Coppola directed this movie and its follow-ups. Not all of his have been great efforts. For me ""One From The Heart"", shot entirely on a sound stage, looks and sounds cheap, I consider it a failure. But he also directed such a fun movie as ""Peggy Sue Got Married"", another ""family"" theme. Al Pacino, even though he was 31 during filming, was still essentially an unknown, but his role as Michael put him on the map, and he is still going strong. ""The Godfather"" is a long movie at three hours, but it never seems long, so well told is its story. It is a classic in every respect, and a copy belongs in the library of every serious movie fan."
"1795","The Godfather",10,"A work of art.","Undeniably one of the finest American motion pictures ever made, The Godfather is a magnificent film beginning what would be one of the finest trilogies and stories to grace the big screen. The Godfather is a pitch perfect film with many factors that mark it out as not only the best film of the 70's  but as one of the finest films ever made. The performances from all are superb, not one actor is out of place and they are given some of the finest dialog to work with. Brando is majestic as Vito and while his performance in this film may be the most famous as well as iconic it is Al Pacino who is undeniably the star. While his films nowadays usually consist of his chewing scenery with a blustering personality and dialog which he shouts, as Michael Corleone, the war hero of a son who is dragged into the family business when there is a hit attempt on his father, he is fantastic, his performance here one of the undisputed best of what is a golden era in Hollywood film making. The journey that the character goes on, from war hero with a loving girlfriend to the head of the 'family' is masterful. It is hard to believe that this was the actor who would go on to be so excessive in Scarface and The Devil's Advocate.Both Brando and Pacino are fantastically supported by a fine supporting cast. Robert Duvall, James Cann, John Cazale and Diane Keaton all put in superb work. The film contains some of the finest acting, writing and directing for a Hollywood film and many a moment that you cannot forget. The Horse's Head scene is one of the most disturbing yet brilliantly executed scenes that you will ever witness, the screenplay by Mario Puzo and Coppola is sublime and tells a wonderful story, while Coppola's direction is his best.  Finally, Nina Rota's music is without doubt one of the best music scores ever composed for a film. Going from waltz to terrifying orchestra in a matter of minutes, it is a music score that will stay with you forever.To sum up, The Godfather is sensational. A fine film from a fine filmmaker."
"1796","The Godfather",4,"Agonising, overrated, what's all the fuss about?","Time and time again my friends berate me for not seeing this film and yet consider me to be something of a 'movie buff'. So they duly sat me down on Saturday night with a curry and the director's cut for my entertainment and delight.All I can say is, there's 3 hours of my life I'm never going to get back. Don't get me wrong; I'm a big fan of gangster movies, I've studied some of the early Cagney/Robinson films and seen most of the more important ones: Scarface, Casino, Goodfellas - I even stayed awake through Once Upon A Time In America. But The Godfather was agonising. Slow, meandering, overly-complicated, lacking punch - what it lashed out in bullets and horses heads, it certainly lacked in dynamite. Watching The Godfather is the cinematic equivalent of the Beach Boys' Pet Sounds; 30 years on it's impossible to see why on earth it was considered so ground-breakingly new and exciting. But by all accounts Coppolla was making a brave movie here, reintroducing a genre stuck in the 1920's and lavishing 168 minutes on the minutiae of one Mafia family.And lavish it he does. The only thing I can say in its defence is that the production design was superb, it lacked for nothing, the overall look of the film was excellent. The budget must have been colossal. What a pity the plot and the dialogue didn't live up to its promise. With a cast so huge and impressive as well, it's twice as pitiful.The legendary Marlon Brando couldn't fail to disappoint - the poor man's legend - in my opinion - far exceeded his talent. I understand the director begged Brando to come out of retirement for this, although I kind of wish he'd stayed there. His incessant mumbling, padded cheeks and all, peering out of dark corners and scratching his face just had me turning the volume way up high and becoming increasingly frustrated. Diane Keaton just played Diane Keaton/Annie Hall (her real name, trivia hounds)as usual, with an increasingly terrible haircut. She looked like she wasn't sure what she was doing in the movie any more than we did, she just looked like she wanted to go home. Her relationship with Pacino totally lacked chemistry and I found his return to her from Sicily as a widower highly unbelievable. Even Pacino's 'thunderbolt' relationship with Apollonia seemed contrived and wooden - I know he's meant to be a hard man but he remained so poker-faced throughout the movie I lost any feelings of sympathy for him.The best part I felt was played by James Caan, whose character was labelled as 'hot tempered' by his father (is that what it takes to be interesting within the Corleone family?!) so of course he met a predictably sticky end like a lot of the better characters. I found a lot of the meandering plot very predictable - to the extent where I was annoying my die-hard fans who put on the show for me, but I couldn't help it: ""Something tells me Apollonia isn't going to get out of that car"" etc. The plot didn't really go anywhere, it just seemed to be setting itself up for that sequel; every 20 minutes or so Brando/Pacino were inviting people to take advantage of 'an offer they couldn't refuse'. It was laughable.Other than Caan's, none of the characters were the slightest bit appealing; the outrageous behaviour of Tommy in Scorsese's Goodfellas, for example, is counterbalanced by his likable personality: you're laughing in spite of yourself. Pacino's protagonist in Scarface is the same - snorting copious amounts of cocaine and waving a gun around - you still care about the guy, however monstrous he's become. But Pacino in The Godfather was just a cartoon bad-ass, like the rest of them, identikit baddies with no depth whatsoever, no remorse, no weakness, no humanity, no growth. When Brando stumbles to his death among the tomato plants in play with his grandson I take that to mean that Coppolla was showing us Vito had a heart but really, it was too little too late.Coppolla may well have been brave in 1972 to reintroduce a decidedly unfashionable genre on a conservative audience, and for the time it might have been a breath of fresh air, but the glamour and pace of subsequent, better, gangster fare puts The Godfather in the shade, however responsible the film may be for the genre's future output."
"1797","The Godfather",10,"Truly the Godfather of movies","Don Vito Corleone (Marlon Brando) is the head of a Mafia family. Sonny (James Caan) is his eldest and heir apparent. Michael (Al Pacino) is a return WWII hero and wants to keep out of the family business. The Don refuses to go into the drug business which precipitate a mob war.There is no doubt that this is one of the greatest movie of all times. Director Francis Ford Coppola has crafted a masterpiece from Mario Puzo's novel. It is not just a great story, but great characters and great actors playing them. Forty years later, it's still as compelling as ever. The pacing is slower than today's standard, but it packs a punch more potent than anything recent. The acting power alone is incredible. When you consider that Al Pacino is the new unknown kid, the cast is unquestionable the best that Hollywood has to offer in that era. Every 10 minutes, there is an iconic scene. There is no way I can list them all.I rarely give a 10. Rarer still do I give it with no reservation. A perfect movie is not enough. It has to have cultural significance and some originality. That is 'The Godfather'. It is still being referenced today. May all the haters sleep with the fishes."
"1798","The Godfather",10,"Mafia 101","The Puzo novel is brought to the screen in the definitive tale of the Mafia. A towering achievement for Coppola, who was only 32 when this film was released. Brando is ideally cast in the title role, but his is basically a supporting role. This is the story of Michael, and Pacino is excellent in conveying the transformation of the character from a geeky soldier to a tough mob boss. Caan, Duvall, and Castellano head the terrific supporting cast. Despite the nearly three-hour running time, it does not drag for a minute. The cinematography perfectly evokes the period. Rota's score is one of the most memorable in film history."
"1799","The Godfather",10,"I'm going to make you an offer you can't refuse. Give ""The Godfather"" 10 stars.","I am not saying anything new when I say that this is the best movie in the history of cinema (at least for most of the people). ""The godfather"" is a major film with a great plot, great performances and it is entertaining since its first moment until the last second. Most of us who have watched it know at least almost of memory some little phrase told by any of its characters.I am not a big fan of Marlon Brando (even thought I found him extraordinary in ""A Streetcar Named Desire (1951)"") but I recognize that he made the role of ""vito corleone"" one of the 5 most important characters in the history of cinema, nobody could have made this character better than him. Al Pacino became famous thanks to his performance as Michael Corleone in this film, where we can see his transformation from a nice guy to a cold mafia boss.I have watched this film like 10 times and each new time I watch it I like it more.The best movie ever"
"1800","The Godfather",10,"Arguably, the greatest film of all time.","The Godfather in one word...Perfect. This film has some of the best scenes I've seen all my life. The script is superb and the director is one of the best in the business. The actors were great and all played a vital role in this masterpiece. Marlon Brando and Al Pacino have possibly given their best performances in this film than any other they have starred in. Some people might not like this film because it's too long but I think that's sad. People like them should absolutely give this film a chance and if they still don't like it then there is something completely wrong with their taste in movies. Overall, The Godfather is an outstanding achievement of Hollywood cinema and it delivers on ALL accounts. There is nothing bad I have to say about this film. It is literally perfect.I give The Godfather a perfect: 5/5 or 10/10"
"1801","The Godfather",10,"The King Of Mob Movies","The godfather is one of those movies i never get tired of watching,its a classic Mob movie,Francis ford Coppola directed this gem with great acting by Marlon Brando,jimmy caan,AL pacino,Robert duvall,Diane Keaton, and john cazale.its a violent,gritty and realistic account of a mafia family with Marlon Brando as don corleone,the big boss.this classic is often imitated but never topped.the story was written by Mario puzo, from his best selling novel.it also stars;Talia shire,Gianni Russo, lee strasberg,john Marley,Alex rocco,and Marianna hill.its an extremely long,a little over 3 hours,best seen uncensored.it was followed by 2 sequels.part 2 was very good,part 3 not so good.as an Italian American i can appreciate the godfather.it is one of a kind.10 out of 10."
"1802","The Godfather",10,"This Consummate, Quintessential World-Class Masterwork Is Head Over Heels Better Than The Dark Knight By a Long Shot, and You All Know It.","The Godfather soaks us up so dry it never has to hustle through. There is something in the deliberate journey of time as Don Corleone entrusts his reins of power that would have made an hour-and-forty-minute-long thriller unbecoming. Even at this length, there are characters in relationships you understand merely by the way they exchange looks, or don't, or speak to each other. We are inclined to associate with Don Corleone's family not because we enjoy their gang wars, but because we have been with them from the opening, where they celebrate a wonderful wedding full of old Italian songs, dances and love, and later we watch them await violence while sitting at the kitchen table and eating the pasta cooked by Clemenza.Endowed with Nino Rota's immortal, extraordinary music score, this consummate masterpiece is entitled The Godfather, a title not only relevant because of the wise Don Vito Corleone, who heads his family with unruffled effectiveness, but also to his son Michael, a hesitant college graduate who is in the beginning feeling shame of his criminal background and firm on living the life of an upright citizen. Coppola follows Michael's ascent to power within the family, on top of the concurrent wearing away of his heart.Vito Corleone himself is not even the central character in the drama. He is a relaxed puppeteer. The central character, really, slowly comes to be the youngest, smartest son, Michael, who absorbs the spirit of his father's standing while reworking his outdated customs. The Godfather's function in the family enterprise is illustrated by his name, existing outside the following generation which will continue and, with any luck, point the family into legal endeavors. Marlon Brando, who plays Vito as a perceptive, resilient model family man in his wise latter years, in fact has the character lead whereas Al Pacino, as Michael, is the lead. Unhurried and physically at ease, one knows his reaction would be of great anger if he were to be harassed. In the face of his grooming, which is given the least effort needed for a good, attractive look, there's a look about him as if he's just awakened, and that first groggy morning hour is the time he always seems to be stuck within. His presence is imprinted with a brooding, nonchalant style. Smooth and understated, he musters a searing inner fire that makes his tremendous character arc so impactful and amazing. But Brando's performance, as always, is expertly offhand, and it earned him an Oscar. His voice and physicality consciously lack precision, and the incidental result is of a man so at home with power that he no longer needs to prompt anyone.The remaining actors furnish one case-in-point after another of superb, instinctive casting. Macho and tempestuous James Caan and pragmatic and down-to-earth Robert Duvall, for instance, hardly have to act to embody their roles. While this, the quintessential crime drama, is an extensive, painstakingly thorough film of nearly three hours, there genuinely isn't time to go into the personal history and distinctiveness of such characters as Clemenza (Richard Castellano), the hardened, heavyset family lieutenant, Jack Woltz (John Marley, who was excellent in Faces), the movie baron, Luca Brasi, the faithful contract killer, McCluskey (Sterling Hayden), the corrupt cop, and the rest. Coppola meets this issue head-on with unassuming typecasting. A character who appears in a story long enough to say hello and goodbye, no matter how small, better be real enough that you can assume who he votes for.Really, the opening wedding sequence deeply familiarizes us with the dynamics of the family, an authoritarianism in the guise of Old World ceremony. Coppola asserts a style and a visual guise that is quintessential, through Gordon Willis's reddish-brown tinted, overexposed cinematography, everything period furnishings.Men wearing black suits sitting in dark boardrooms parley the particulars of prostitution and gambling, and fashion an isolated society that issues stability and integrity, that is in terms of their own advantages. Politicians and policemen are merely intimidated or trafficked. Esteem and reliability are the legal tender, and all influence emerges from the Don, who calmly keeps quiet control over his territory.His successor is Santino, the Caan role, always cooking with implicit rage and is incredibly eager to inherit the position. His brothers are Michael and the sniveling pushover Fredo, played by the late John Cazale. The Duvall role is Tom Hagen, the unemotional, factual family lawyer and all-around professional shrewd pragmatist embraced by Vito as a child and brought up as his own. The women are not much more than background scenery. Vito's wife scarcely speaks or even appears. Sonny's wife suffers silently through his shameless infidelity, and the Corleone daughter, Connie, played by Talia Shire, is so often overlooked that her brothers take no notice of her unless she protests about her disgusting husband having beaten her.An assault on Vito's life alters Michael's attitude, and he comes back to help defend his family's wellbeing as Sonny takes rash control, making a mess of the business and laying everyone on the line, while the laid up and incapacitated Vito can do no more than look on. Michael's bona fide defining moment make its mark in one of the film's most unforgettable scenes of ultimate virtuosity. He takes it upon himself to do a hit at a small Italian restaurant, using a gun that was left for him in a bathroom stall. This forces him into banishment in Sicily, where he solidifies his determination to return his family to a status of eminence."
"1803","The Godfather",8,"Pretty good, but bore at times.","Pretty good, but a bore at times. The plot was very good and has some turns, but overall the story unfolded very slowly. Only the actors did a great job to save the day. I was also very impressed by the music, when you closed your eyes, the music alone can put you in the story."
"1804","The Godfather",10,"One of the greats, if not the great.","There isn't a gangster film out there bigger or better than The Godfather. It's hard to some it up in a few words, but here goes. At the centre of this film is the family. The Corleone family, headed by Vito (Marlon Brando), a.k.a. The Don, or The Godfather. His daughter's wedding tells us all we need to know about the Corleone's; key individuals, small but incredibly thought out sub-plots and a running theme of business and personal matters never mix. The Godfather is based on the simplest of foundations. Love thy family. Think before you act. Never betray your own. Vito attempts to keep the peace between the crime families. When things go south Vito's youngest son Michael (Al Pacino) gets involved. Michael's innocence is torn apart as he takes control of the family business.With every view comes a new discovery, a piece of the puzzle missed the last time round. The Godfather is a labyrinth waiting to be deciphered. Brando is sublime. He's able to radiate warmth and coercion with the smallest of reactions. It sets up careers for James Caan and Robert Duvall, who're brothers with dissimilar attitudes. The best is to come for Pacino, as this first part in a trilogy only shows his potential. The Godfather is a one of the most intense gangsters films you're ever likely to see."
"1805","The Godfather",10,"Masterpiece","No one can deny this movie being one of the (if not THE) greatest movies ever made. It is brilliant. Great performances by an amazing cast (that was controversial among the studio), beautiful music, brilliant directing of course, cinematography to die for and a storyline that fascinated me from the very first to the very last minute. The movie goes deep into the family and lets you be part of a dramatic journey. I would definitely recommend this movie to ANYONE. It is one of my all time favourite movies and I can watch it over and over again, finding more and more beauty in it every time. It is sad that many friends my age have never seen this movie."
"1806","The Godfather",10,"Timeless classic...!!!!!","Contains no spoiler..!!.Firstly i must say what mind blowing performance by Al Pacino and Marlon Brando.Even after 40 years this movie doesn't get old .Based on novel by Mario Puzo's,Francis has done beautiful job portraying greatest mob drama of all time.

"1807","The Godfather",10,"Such a freaking classic.","Don Vito Corleone: ""You talk about vengeance. Is vengeance going to bring your son back to you? Or my boy to me?"". The godfather to me is a bloody brilliant masterpiece of a film and people may say it is not they cup of tea and am okay with that but this movie changed the way that I thought of movies, the story is about a man called Don Vito Corleone who has this big family and big friends and all in the middle of all of that the family and friends don't know that he works with the gangsters, The acting is out of this world and the music is so chilling and moving with a gangster feel mixed with it, R.I.P.

"1808","The Godfather",10,"One Of The Greatest Films Ever Made. An Excellent,Brilliant,Powerful Unforgettable Masterpiece From Francis Ford Coppola.","The Godfather is one of the greatest films ever made,an excellent,brilliant,powerful and unforgettable masterpiece that combines terrific direction,amazing performances from an outstanding cast,a wonderful script and a powerful score. All of those elements make The Godfather a flawless film that is cinema and Francis Ford Coppola at their best.Based on Mario Puzo's novel and set in New York City in the 1940s and 50s,The Godfather tells the story of Vito Corleone(Marlon Brando),a Don and Mob Boss who is the head of The Corleone Family but is aging. But when Vito becomes a victim of Mob warfare,his youngest son Michael Corleone(Al Pacino)steps in to take over the family as the new don and to protect his Father and family at all costs.What else can be said about The Godfather that hasn't been said before? It's an absolute masterpiece of cinema that is an instant classic from the moment you first watch it. There are plenty of iconic and memorable characters,lines and moments throughout the film that have become apart of our pop culture that when you the name The Godfather everyone knows what the film is even if people haven't seen it. The Godfather is a very revolutionary film especially with the Gangster/Mob genre because before The Godfather Gangster and Mob films used to be defined by the great Warner Bros Gangster Crime Dramas that starred movie icons James Cagney,Edward G. Robinson and Humphrey Bogart but The Godfather reinvented the Gangster/Mob genre and has a style that has been imitated but not duplicated. Where would Martin Scorsese's classic Gangster epics Goodfellas and Casino or the classic TV series The Sopranos be without The Godfather? The Godfather is a big,epic film that gives viewers a larger than life depiction of a organized Crime family showing the danger,tragedy and sadness that goes on in the violent world that the Corleone's have to deal with throughout the film. Some have said that The Godfather and it's sequels romanticizes the Gangster and Mafia lifestyle and made the mafia world bright and while that may or may not be true,The Godfather is still surrounded with darkness showing the horrifying and deadly consequences of being in the Gangster world where no one is safe. The film is an epic in the truest sense of the world with the length being 175 minutes(2 hrs and 55 minutes)and with The Godfather being an epic there is multiple characters and story lines but director Francis Coppola keeps the film interesting and keeps you glued to the screen with many powerful,intense scenes that punch the viewer in the gut. The screenplay by Francis Coppola and Mario Puzo is amazing and flawless with many scenes and dialog that is riveting and powerful and none of the dialog and scenes feel forced or fake but feel natural and believable. The screenplay while taking out some of the subplots of the book stays true to Mario Puzo's book with dialog that comes directly from the book. The Godfather's script is movie screen writing at it's very best The Godfather gave birth to two of the greatest and most iconic characters in movie history in Vito Corleone and Michael Corleone. When we see Vito in the first we are easily captivated by him and how he is because despite being a don and major crime figure he can be friendly and helpful with his family and friends earning tons of respect. Vito is also smart and has a moral code when it comes with his family while at the same time using violence against his enemies when needed. With Michael we see how different he becomes throughout the film because at first he wants nothing to do with the family business but when his Father and family are in danger in Michael's mind he has no choice but to run the family but in his own way. Where as Vito is a friendly and helpful don,Michael is cold and vicious but with these two characters there is many levels of depth that make them classic characters you will never forget. Violence plays a big part in The Godfather and the violence in this film shocking with scenes that are brutal and harsh but are true to the universe that The Godfather takes place in. The ending of The Godfather is easily one of the best endings in movie history and greatly sets up the events in Part II. A terrific ending.The cast is flawless. Marlon Brando is excellent,iconic and at his very best in his Oscar winning role as Vito Corleone,with Brando being charismatic,powerful and sympathetic in the role. Masterful performance from Brando. Al Pacino is brilliant as Michael Corleone,with Pacino being intense,cool and captivating in the role and having great scenes with Brando. James Caan is amazing and fiery as Santino 'Sonny' Corleone,Michael's short tempered older brother. Roberl DuVall is terrific as Tom Hagan,the Corleone's adopted family member and lawyer. Diane Keaton is great as Kay Adams,Michael's girlfriend. Richard Castellano(Clemenza)and Abe Vigoda(Tessio)do wonderful jobs as Vito's Caporegimes. John Gazale(Fredo Corleone),Talia Shire(Connie Corleone),Al Lettieri(Sollozzo),Sterling Hayden(Capt. McCluskey),John Marley(Jack Woltz),Richard Conte(Don Barzini),Alex Rocco(Moe Greeneand Gianni Russo(Carlo)give riveting performances as well.The direction by Francis Coppola is brilliant and stylish,with Coppola always moving the camera and using great lighting and a visual look to the movie that makes The Godfather what it is. Masterful direction,Coppola.The score by Nino Rota is amazing,beautiful,haunting and iconic matching the movie and every scene perfectly. Terrific score Rota.In final word,if you love Francis Coppola,Gangster Films,Mob Movies,Crime Dramas or cinema in general,I highly suggest you see The Godfather,an excellent and unforgettable masterpiece that you will watch again,again and again and is film making at it's best. Highly Recommended. 10/10."
"1809","The Godfather",10,"A view from the other side of life.","The mafia was always seen as evil, secretive and not interesting enough to be a story. Then came The Godfather and today countless movies and television shows take place about gangsters and the mafia. But what a great risk it must have been for Francis Ford Coppola to adapt Mario Puzo's best-seller to the big screen. He succeeded in the two areas I believe are the most important in film: acting and writing.The screenplay by Coppola and Puzo is one of the tightest and carefully constructed scripts of any movie. The film takes place completely within the world of the Corleone family, so we are never asked to hate these people nor sympathize with them. Yet we do, due to the countless scenes involving them eating, drinking, talking. There is a 30 minute wedding scene in the beginning that sets the mood and tone, showing how these people have taken advantage of the American dream. Now that we know them, we care for what happens to them despite the fact that they are evil.The acting is so powerful, so effective that it is impossible to think anyone could have filled these roles instead. Al Pacino, who was hated by the producers but loved by Coppola, plays Michael very straight and emotionless. His blank stare says everything and nothing, but all along we see change and it is his change of heart and personality that is the most amazing development in the whole film. James Caan is perfect as the hot-headed Sonny, Robert Duvall perfect as the level-headed Tom Hagen, and of course Marlon Brando overtakes everyone as the aging patriarch, Don Vito Corleone. Brando is usually considered the greatest actor ever, and here he goes full length, portraying a man who has been in America most of his life and is growing weary of the direction in which business seems to be going.The Godfather is one of the best films ever if only for the fact that it is able to suck you in completely to this world. It is long but never plods and always builds with every scene. Indeed, each early scene is somewhat of a set-up for something later. The actors all play it so straight and smooth, everything is completely convincing. And Gordon Willis' dark, moody photography adds to the drama, evoking hidden agendas and secrets. Nino Rota composed one of the most famous of all movie themes, and here it seems to tell us that life is going to get bad and we should have listened to Don Vito. This film put Coppola on the map and made him a director to reckon with. Just like the Corleones."

It also tops some list concerning the greatest and most memorable movie lines and the movie it's characters and performances from its actors have also received lots of acclaim throughout the years. And yes, the movie is truly deserving all of the praise that is receiving from everywhere and everyone.Even though in my opinion part II is an even better movie, this is still the movie that began it all. Without this movie there of course would had never been a second one and this movie beautifully laid down the foundations for the even greater masterpiece that part II was, even though it's missing the presence of the great Marlon Brando in it.The movie is a greatly epic one, not in the least due to it's amazing running time of 175 minutes. But despite it's very long running time it really is not a movie that ever bores, even not at moments when not a lot is happening in the story. There always is something great or intriguing happening.But the movie is also really epic in many more different ways. It's like an operatic drama about a large Italian mafia family, located in New York. The movie features really a lot of characters in it and therefore also some different plot lines and dramatic developments but the movie does an amazing job with its story and the diversity of it. It binds it all beautifully together and even though the movie does take some big leaps in time and gets located at different locations throughout the world, throughout the entire movie, the movie always keeps flowing very well with a real steady pace.The family and basically all of the character have to go through some great ordeals. This means that characters keep developing throughout the entire, which is most notable with the Al Pacino character. His character goes through a great transformation, from being a polite, quite and perhaps also soft guy, to a tough and commanding crime boss, who doesn't back off for violence or any killings.In its essence it's a movie about tight bond of a family and what it means to stay loyal and stick together through tough times. Even though you know that all of these people are big criminals and even killers, the movie at all times keeps giving them a very human face by showing what makes them tick and it also isn't afraid to show the character emotions.It's of course also thanks to the many great characters of the movie that the characters develop so well and work out on basically every level. It features a still quite young Al Pacino in his break through role and the already more experienced and better known actors James Caan and James Caan, among many others, in important supporting roles. But it is of course Marlon Brando who gives the movie its most body. He plays one of the most memorable movie characters of all time and it was also basically this movie that made him immortal as an actor. The movie only won 3 Oscars but it's no big surprise that one of those 3 went to Brando, who himself of course refused to accept it and instead let faked Indian Sacheen Littlefeather pick it up, as a sign of protest against the treatment of native Americans. The other two Oscar's that the movie won were for best motion picture and best writing.It deserved to win way more of course and the movie was also nominated for 7 more (not counting in the withdrawn nomination for best music). But one of the Oscar's the movie really deserved to win was for a category it wasn't even nominated in. I was surprised how great the cinematography of the movie was and it truly deserves some more credit. The movie often picks some long shots, in which it isn't always showing a lot. The movie often chooses to show a minimum of things and only chooses to show what the characters also see, so we get more close to the characters and their feelings and thoughts. Truly some effective cinematography throughout, though Francis Ford Coppola directing also needs to take lots of credit for that.Simply THE crime epic of the 20th century.10/10http://bobafett1138.blogspot.com/"
"1811","The Godfather",10,"with its long, but taut running time, perfect casting, and all under the control of Francis Ford Coppola, ""The Godfather"" easily scores as one of the best films ever made","When it comes to naming the greatest and most influential motion pictures of all time, Francis Ford Coppola's 1972 masterpiece ""The Godfather"" is a title that is practically guaranteed to be among the many listed. Famed director Stanley Kubrick called ""The Godfather"" a candidate for the best movie ever made and ""without a doubt, the best cast."" Although not very familiar with Kubrick's films and his tastes, I will say that on the second regard, he is absolutely correct.Based on a very good, hard-to-put-down novel by Italian American novelist Mario Puzo, the film revolves around a fictional 1940s Sicilian crime family based in New York. The family is run by a wispy-voiced, puffy-cheeked man named Vito Corleone (Marlon Brando) who has, for the most part, moved away from the days of violence in favor of peace and prosperity without blood and above all things, lectures on the topics of friendship and loyalty. When an attempt is made on Vito's life, his two sons (James Caan, Al Pacino) and his adoptive son (Robert Duvall) take control of his dynasty and fight to keep him alive and what unfolds is a repeat of days gone by and the world of the Mafia is exposed to a spellbound, absorbed audience.""The Godfather"" is nearly three hours in length and part of this is due to the fact that it follows Mario Puzo's novel almost exactly detail-by-detail, scene-by-scene: a very rare thing in Hollywood, which always seems more than happy to alter and reshape the mold of the authors' visions for the big screen. Coppola's film will without a doubt satisfy the purists, and even to those who have not had the privilege of reading Puzo's fantastic book, this is still a more than enjoyable way to spend three hours. Even at such a length, ""The Godfather"" never fails to keep our eyes focused on the screen.Number one, we have great characters in what is possibly the greatest cast ever assembled for a single movie. Marlon Brando was great; that was a given. But what really impressed the audiences of 1972, and what still impresses people, are the performances of the supporting cast. Names such as Al Pacino, Robert Duvall, and James Caan, who are at icon status today, were nobodies at the time. Al Pacino, in particular, gives a noteworthy performance that garnered him an Academy Award nomination and made the producers who initially wanted to ban him from the role feel like the biggest idiots on the face of the planet. Pacino is undoubtedly the most ironic character in the film. When we first see him, he's not even so much as a sliver of a Mafia-type image. He's passive, he's quiet, shy, with a clean record, and a war hero. Then, when he has to assume a Family role to defend his father, he slowly turns into the image of his predecessor and by the time the film ends, Pacino is the exact opposite of how we first saw him. Of course I can't leave out Diane Keaton as Pacino's love interest, who watches him change before her eyes, James Caan as the fiery-tempered brother, Robert Duvall as the Family consiligere, and one of my favorites, Al Lettieri as the villainous, steely-eyed Virgil Sollozzo, who fits the exact image of how I pictured the character while reading the novel.Second, there is the fantastic element that the whole realm of the story takes place in the world of the Mafia. There is none of the tired old elements of, shall we say, detectives trying to uncover the Mafia and take them down or civilians who become victims of the organized crime families. With this method, we successfully connect with and understand the motivations of the characters while the outside world, law and otherwise, simply lies in the background. The outside world meant little to the Mafia, and thus it means little to us as well.But of course, ""The Godfather"" does not glorify the Mafia. Yes, we do identify and sometimes feel for the characters in this savage world, but never do we justify for them. And when director Francis Ford Coppola tries to give us horrifying violence, he delivers. As he noted in his commentary on the film, Coppola worked hard with his pyrotechnics crew to make all of the shootings and killings in ""The Godfather"" look real as opposed to making them obvious simulations. He uses blood, but not so much to the point where it becomes over the top, but just enough to make it convincing and disgusting.""The Godfather"" was an enormous hit when it was first released. It garnered there Academy Award wins included Best Picture of the Year and broke box office records that would not be topped until ""Jaws"" (1975) was released three years later. Al Pacino, James Caan, and Robert Duvall were all secured nominations in the Best Supporting Actor category but surprisingly none of them won. It also spawned two successful sequels, one of which I feel is actually superior to the original. And now Francis Ford Coppola has worked with Robert A. Harris to restore his famous trilogy and give it the pristine print that he always wanted audiences to see it in. Among other films such as ""Lawrence of Arabia"" (1962), ""Vertigo"" (1958), and ""Spartacus"" (1960), ""The Godfather"" is certainly a film that deserves a beautiful restoration so that it may linger in our collective minds for generations to come."
"1812","The Godfather",10,"""I believe in America""","'The Godfather (1972)' doesn't need an introduction, nor does it necessarily require a review. Nevertheless, I'm going to go on telling you what you already know: this is one of the great American films of the twentieth century. The 1970s was a landmark decade for Hollywood film-making, and Francis Ford Coppola was particularly productive, releasing the first two 'Godfather' films (1972 - 1974), 'The Conversation (1974)' and, perhaps his magnum opus, 'Apocalypse Now (1979).' This week I was fortunate enough to experience a cinema screening of 'The Godfather,' and this second viewing only inflated my respect for Coppola's achievement. On my initial viewing in 2006, I had been very impressed with the film, but also hopelessly lost for the most part. With literally dozens of speaking roles, and frequent allusions to otherwise unseen characters, the plot had left me stranded, just as 'The Big Sleep (1946)' always manages to do. Suddenly, however, much of it became clear to me; the characters' motivations, deceptions and emotions gently drifted into focus. This was stunning, complex cinema, the sort of bold film-making that puts most modern movies to shame.A notable artistic observation regarding 'The Godfather' is that Coppola's film-making style is strictly traditional. Whereas a new generation of filmmakers like Martin Scorsese and William Friedkin were introducing a gritty new cinema aesthetic, Gordon Willis' cinematography is graceful, understated and handsome, predating his excellent work for Woody Allen {the most notable example being 'Manhattan (1979)'}. A sprawling family saga, 'The Godfather' boasts a staggering ensemble cast of emerging and established actors, as well as many unknowns who nevertheless give letter-perfect performances. The scenes of violence are typically abrupt and effective, but much of the film's running-time is more closely concerned with dialogue and human interaction, particularly among family members. Needless to say, the quality of talent is more than enough to make these scenes, not only watchable, but astonishingly compelling. Every character down to the smallest speaking part <U+0096> and there are a lot of them <U+0096> has such a richly fleshed-out personality, making their actions and development throughout the film both authentic and interesting.Marlon Brando <U+0096> in what, along with 'Last Tango in Paris (1972),' was deemed a grand comeback <U+0096> gives a towering, Oscar-winning portrayal as Don Vito Corleone, the aging head of an Italian organised-crime family. Having endured decades of corruption and inter-family conflict, and seeing his household disintegrate in the futile pursuit of family honour, Vito finally understands in his final moments the folly of his wasted life, and the fateful mistakes that led to this undesirable lifestyle {these precursor years would be explored in greater depth, with Robert DeNiro in the role, in 'The Godfather: Part II (1974)'}. Most central to the story, however, is the transformation of youngest son Michael (Al Pacino), who, in the course of the film, effectively sells his soul to retain that elusive ""family honour."" The climactic sequence, utilising Eisenstein's style of montage to its fullest extent, intercuts the baptism of Michael's nephew with the simultaneous assassination of the Corleone family's enemies. This scene also serves as a baptism of sorts for Michael, symbolising his irreversible initiation into a life of crime, and the final transaction of his soul."

I should thank my father for this, because as kids, we watched what he watched and it formatted me for ever: the music, the pride and honor of the family, their confidence find a resonance in me, even though their heart are deeply corrupted by evil and they pay the price by the death of all dear ones! What's the point of getting rich and powerful if it to live alone ? You can read my review of the ""The Last Don"" for an in-depth analysis because the thematic background is the same<U+0085>Brando is wonderful as an old Don and he looks like my late grandfather. As we haven't time to spend time together, I am sure I take Vito as an idealized root! What caught my eyes in this first movie was that: - the story takes place just after WWII (and not in 60 or 70) - it's Christmas time just as the projection - the dementia greed of Vito who wants a son to be President! - Their way of getting at the top: when they are denied help, they kill & when they are asked for help, they exchange it for a favor! It's far from streets tugs who ransom people!So, as it is maybe the best movie ever made, you should see it and it's an offer you can't refuse!"
"1814","The Godfather",10,"Cinematic Classic","The Godfather (1972, Dir.

But when Don Vito is shot and ends up in hospital, control of the family business is given to his son, Michael (Pacino), who must go into hiding for the protection of himself and his father.Cinematic classic which can't go wrong. Marlon Brando has been perfectly cast in the role which gains every emotion from him. Along with Pacino and the rest of the supporting cast, the Godfather keeps you hooked in for the entire length of its running time.He came all the way from California.

"1815","The Godfather",10,"Really one of the greatest films ever made...","The Godfather tells us the tale of a Mafia family and their struggles to keep up with the changing times, and at the same time to value their own morals about family and friendship.This is an excellent movie, the cast ensemble is perfect and the subtle characterization of Michael Corleone played by Al Pacino is beyond recognition. Marlon Brando kicks up a great acting as the Godfather and at the same time a family man. Talia Shire is, as always, quite overacting, nevertheless that quality proved to be effective in this film.The story is unique in every aspect and convincing to the last scene. The irony presented within every climactic event in the story will put you in the edge of your seats and think ""How the heck did they come up to this idea?"" The way the twists are presented subtly, the absence of unessential brutality (which is present in almost every crime films these days), the hidden message of the story, the tragedy, the drama, the flawless direction, and most of all the realistic storyline that makes us infinitely more aware of the life experienced by a family whose business is crime-oriented. A very disturbing yet wonderful experience to watch this film.This is really one of the greatest ever made by the movie industry. You'll miss more than half of your life not watching it. :)"
"1816","The Godfather",10,"A beautiful film","I have not watched this film since the 70's. But my 18 year old son kept on pestering me to watch it with him because it was the IMDb No1. The IMDb rating is our guide for watching any film and that infuriates my wife ""Why can't you two just enjoy a film without checking if it's good or not on that website you go on?"" I put off watching it with him for ages because it's about 3 hours long and I'm prone to falling asleep. But I watched the Godfather again tonight with my wife and son. We were silent from start to finish with the power and emotion of this film. I just love the way this the film portrays the mafia as an ordinary family that we begin to like. They have staunch religious beliefs in attending weddings, baptisms and funerals plus morals like we won't do narcotics. Yet they can murder somebody and it's just ""business"". The Godfather has no car chase, no gory violence and no idol threats like ""I'm going to blow you away motherf*cker"" It just makes you an offer that you can't refuse."
"1817","The Godfather",10,"Why The Godfather Rocks !!!","I saw the movie some years back mainly due to the hype..

I was hooked on to the book like a Harry Potter fan & couldn't put it down..THEN..I watched the movie ... Then I knew why there was so much hype around the movie even after 30 years...The movie just brought back the characters to life...I loved it & thus the rating 9.6/10 However the movie is not as good as the book.... but I think it's as close a movie will ever get to the original.. Which by the way is a masterpiece..The casting for the movie is flawless..You really feel that they belong in the book..All in all The Godfather won the Academy Awards for Best Picture, Best Actor in a Leading Role and Best Writing (adapted screenplay) (Francis Coppola, Mario Puzo)...

"1818","The Godfather",10,"""I'm gonna make him an offer he can't refuse""","Don Vito Corleone is the mightiest Mafia boss of New York. He has contacts to the most esteemed politicians and achieves everything he gets into his head. This changes when a drug dealer asks him to join the drug traffic. Vito declines this offer, because he (ironically) considers this ""line of business"" to be a crime. Thereon the drug dealers' men assault Vito and he nearly loses his life. His sons Sonny and Michael thereupon start a campaign of vengeance against the drug dealer and the other dons of New York.With high expectations I began to watch the film, due to the fact that it is the highest rated movie of the IMDb and regarded as one of the best films all-time.In the first half hour there are comparatively few spectacular events, but ""The Godfather"" manages it to tie the viewer, conveying the atmosphere very well. So the movie never becomes boring. The interaction of the Mafiosi, their language and methods are amazingly enthralling. Also the setting (amongst others the film takes place in Sicily) and the film music are outstanding.The main characters are presented very well: The mighty Godfather, who has moralities and takes care of his family despite his racketeering, and on the other hand the ""good boy"" of the family, who is impelled to dirty his hands and become an unscrupulous, ice cold gangster by the assault on his father.Francis Ford Coppola's film becomes a true masterpiece by the performance of the two leading actors, Marlon Brando (Vito Corleone) and Al Pacino (Michael Corleone). Their facial expressions and gestures are just unparalleled and don't lay you to rest.The film won prizes in series (Oscars, Golden Globes) <U+0096> that's absolutely merited: Everyone should watch this film at least one time; it is a very prestigious film, above all amongst men it is popular, and it has a very high cultic-factor."

Otherwise I loved everything about the Godfather.8 out of 10. (Pushing a 9)"
"1820","The Godfather",10,"an obvious word: masterpiece","The Godfather is Franis Ford Coppolla's best work (next to Apocalypse Now) and is one of the best films I have ever seen. It shows a way of life not shown before this film was released and most likely it shocked them as much as it shocked me. The Acting (among many other things) highlight this film-noir/gangster/epic including Marlon Brando in his most recognizable performance ever as the man himself, Don Corleone, but also subtle work from breakthrough star Al Pacino and others like James Caan, Robert Duvall, and great bit parts for wonderful character actors like John Marley and Sterling Hayden.Corleone gets wounded and, by default through various 'circumstances' in the family (not least of which his ailing health) hands his ""business"" over to his ambivalent but cunning son, Michael (in a well done performance by Al Pacino). The film goes on long, but after watching it a few times, you hardly notice it at all. Every time ones watches this film it gets better because of noticing something small, something wildly creative, one didn't notice the last time and thanks to that it gets richer every time. With a beautiful score, terrific cinematography, and sublime directing and writing by Coppolla (with Puzo) this film belongs not only a place in film history, but in world history as well."

I won't sit here defending this colossal masterpiece, it needs no such thing. The Godfather is the definitive inside to the operations, bonds and thoughts of the Mafia.

The story is a little too simplistic, and it doesn't try to bite off more than it can chew. In that sense, the film's climax probably won't seem too revolutionary when viewed in 2020 where 'sinning' is more of an innuendo than something religious.There are some predictable turns, there are some funny moments, there's a little sexual exploration (something the film could have dwelled more on, given its theme), and there's a neat central performance from Natalia Dyer. For a 25-year-old playing a high-school teenager, I really enjoyed her adorable facial expressions for the most part.

For the majority of the movie, Natalia Dyer plays the complete opposite of her best known character Nancy on Stranger Things. Dyer delivers a heartfelt portrayal of a confused Catholic teen with that is largely delivered through her body language and facial expressions at a religious retreat that is not quite what it proclaims to be.

And that's it. That's it.The film has a message. And it's a good one. But it throws it in your face and hopes you're comfortable with it. Things that are captured in the film do happen. That's totally true. But not like that. The script is based on throwing scene after scene at you where the church is being hypocritical and, as I say, it's a good thing. It's a good message, and it's something that happens. But you don't have to show it that way because the viewer quickly becomes disoriented and doesn't feel it's something real.All of these scenes are NOT good for anything. Just get past the window scene and NOTHING. Pass the computer scene and the bracelet, and NOTHING happens. Minutes later the great speech of our protagonist is about to come, where she will finally be able to gather courage and not shut up about what she has seen... NO. The scene is ruined by a joke and everything comes to nothing.Damn, I don't know what happens in this movie, but I feel that it has a good intention but a very bad script.

This is very much not a comedy. There may be a funny moment or two, but I came into the film expecting something similar to Saved!
And then spent the whole film not laughing & being upset at every lost opportunity for a great funny moment. I can only guess that the writer/editor did not actually intend this to be a comedy at all.As a sort of coming-of-age drama, this may be a decent flick, but when I was expecting a comedy, I just spent the whole movie feeling very unsatisfied. Even as a drama, the pacing is very slow/off - at one point I had to check how far into it I was. 2/3 through and it still felt like just barely the introduction.Decent acting, but unless you feel this story speaks to you personally, skip it."

I'm not sure why they felt the need to set this in the past, but still in the era of the internet and the mobile telephone.

"1841","Yes, God, Yes",7,"A charming coming-of-age film with a wonderful message","A really solid coming-of-age drama that portrays the transition from innocent youth to world-weary adult in stark fashion, Yes, God, Yes blends sobering drama with charming humour and charisma in a short but punchy tale of personal growth and discovery.Combining perspectives on institutional hypocrisy and personal maturing, this is a film with a lot to say, and for the most part, it does a great job. Far from a preachy or even aggressive attack on those it discredits, it's a movie that's genuinely charming, heartfelt and tempered in its approach.Though it might sound like a strange topic for an 'inspiring' film to focus on, our young lead's discovery of the pleasures of masturbation are used as a metaphor for her coming-of-age, and discovery that the world she has been instructed by all her life is not in fact all-knowing.Taking this discovery as a cue for a quiet yet powerful rebellion against her strict Catholic community, she begins to open up to the wider world, as well as to the reality of how hypocritical those who seek to teach her rigid morality act.In that, the film isn't so much of an attack on Catholicism or Catholics themselves, but rather uses the extremes of the religion to showcase how damaging and hypocritical certain practices and ideologies can be on young people.Natalia Dyer gives a wonderful performance that sees her proving convincing both as a sheltered and innocent teenager as well as a quietly rebellious young adult, and it's through her that you really understand the hurtful effects of the hypocrisies of her elders, particularly given how free she becomes once she removes the shackles of her upbringing and begins to fight back.Dyer is funny and charming all the way through, and brings a soft, sweet presence to what could at times have been a very heavy watch. In that, Yes, God, Yes isn't quite as intensely dramatic as The Miseducation Of Cameron Post, which also looks at the consequences of extremist education, but it is just as charismatic and enjoyable as it is hard-hitting.Featuring a pleasant dash of '00s nostalgia too, Yes, God, Yes is a thoroughly enjoyable watch, with buckets of drama and thought-provoking themes taking centre stage over the course of a punchy 78 minutes. The lead performance from Natalia Dyer is wonderful too, and her blend of charisma and dramatic chops gives the film's sobering message an uplifting and even inspiring edge."
"1842","Yes, God, Yes",4,"Done dozen times before ... and each was better than this","The only thing new and different here is Dyer - who needs better material and a new agent."
"1843","The Outpost",10,"Finally a movie that's accurate.","I did two combat deployments to Afghanistan and one to Iraq. I can tell you without a doubt this movie is the most accurate representation of FOB/COP life, soldier lingo, and to an extent the combat.Most reviews I've read complain of sub-par dialogue and not a clear story as to what was going on prior to the attack, but I bet that most of the reviews were from people who have never been to war. In war Dialogue between soldiers is not interesting, it's dark, unfiltered, and usually disgusting. We degrade each other, fight each other, we say things so offensive and disgusting that most people would think we have issues. In war you also don't always have a clear cut mission that you can make into some grand Hollywood story. When you deploy you are supposed to find bad guys and help locals, that's it. Those hoping war has some interesting story will be disappointed. You sit around bored, exhausted, missing home, working out, eating garbage food, piss in tubes/bottles (first movie I've seen that showed the bottles), burn your own crap, watch movies, go on patrol and maybe get shot at. Every so often you get a big mission where the combat gets intense. Then it's rinse and repeat, that's how it is and I'm sure prior to the attack, that's how life on Keating was. This movie depicts life in the military so accurately that I was like ""my gosh finally someone did it, they got it right it"". So to anyone reading this, this is as real as you'll find it until something else is made. All those who talk smack about it are idiot keyboard warriors.The combat itself is good, explosions look real even the CGI ones were ok, none of that dumb fireball explosion crap, the dust and smoke generated from shooting and explosions to the point the soldiers in the movie were coughing from it was legit. Now I wasn't in this battle but I've been in my fair share of fights I can tell you that tracer rounds aren't as fruitful as you see here. Most of the time you get shot at an have no idea where it came from except maybe a general direction. Muzzle flashes also are hard to see unless it's at night and you could see them all over in this movie. Usually you just see dust or smoke from where they shot, not flashes. But Hollywood has to do this for the effect as it does makes firefights look cool and without seeing tracer bullets whiz by it takes away from the intensity.
Also the soldiers were able to yell and talk to each other from long distances. Yea that doesn't happen, war is ungodly loud, you have to be screaming in a dudes ear to hear you.
When the air support showed up finally, how it was being controlled didn't make sense, but that's just me being nit picky as not many people know what the hell is going on with that.
The tactics were decent, you could tell there was some military advising for sure but some things didn't make sense. Not sure if that's how it happened or just Hollywood though.Overall if you want to watch the most realistic depiction of how the war in Afghanistan is, this is it. To all the naysayers saying this is garbage, hate the way the soldiers talk to each other, or wish there was a more clear story/mission, you obviously have never been there.RIP to all the fallen in this battle"
"1844","The Outpost",8,"An extremely visceral re-telling of a forgotten battle in Aghanistan","PREMISE - The Outpost depicts the battle of Outpost Keating, known as the Battle of Kamdesh, which took place on October 3rd 2009, close to the border with Pakistan in Afghanistan. The Outpost itself was located on the bend of a river in a valley, completely overlooked by high mountains on all sides. It was simply put, a nigntmare to defend and a prime target to over run. So it would be that 300 Taliban fighters would attempt to do just that over two fateful days that October.
In addition to the harsh terrain the location had other issues. Helicopter re-supply was extremely challenging and dangerous and could only be conducted at night (A previous re-supply attempted killed 12 people, not depicted in the movie) meaning only night landings when there was no moon were possible. Due the nature of the base being located effectively in the bottom of a funnel, in-direct fire support from artillary was impossible and the nearest close air-support was thirty minutes away. Into this nightmare scenario 53 American Soldiers were expected to defend the worst position possible, so the stage was set for a modern day Zulu and one of the bloodiest close quarter conflicts of the war in Afghanistan.THE CAST - Casting here is impressive and suspiciously full of the children and grandchildren of famous actors and directors. (Jagger, Gibson, Eastwood, Attenborough) Knowing full well that it is difficult to often tell men apart in uniform during depictions of conflict on screen, we have an interesting range of faces, the most easy to spot of which is SCOTT EASTWOOD, proving to be every bit his Father's son as Staff Sgt Clint Romesha, he and CALEB LANDRY JONES both give stand out performances but the rest of the cast are solid too, special mentions to: CORY HARDRICT, TAYLOR JOHN SMITH. and the ever dependable JACK KESY. Senior Officers are played by MILO GIBSON (Whose making a good name for himself despite the challenge of having to fill size 22 shoes) and ORLANDO BLOOM, who appears to have come full circle from playing PFC Blackburn in Blackhawk Down to playing Captain Keating here, whom the camp was ultimately named after. A number of younger British actors do incredibly well and even Producer JOHNATHAN YUNGER gets in on the action!PRODUCTION - The film was predominantly shot in Bulgaria, as you would expect for a film being produced by Millenium Pictures, but the set up for the camp is convincing and adequately conveys the issues facing the defenders, although the depiction of the terrain is slightly different. The first half of the film tells the story of the various officers who were stationed at the camp before leaving the final third of the film to depict the battle. It is here where ex-soldier turned director ROD LURIE and DOP LORENZO SENATORE do a superb job of giving us a balls to the wall depiction of the final assault and place you firmly in the middle of it, making me regret I could not have experienced the sequence on the big screen. Several long takes (all the rage these days) give a very realistic depiction of following one character in the battle, then another. They also employ a clever techique of depicting the deaths of the real personnel involved, seen primarily form the third person, which felt like a sensible and sensitive approach to the issue in question. One of the most dependable sargeants is wounded early on during the firefight which has an impact on the battle morale of the soldiers whom find themselves fighting for their lives minute by minute. Enough screen time is given to depicting the local political problems facing the American officers, who did their best under extremely challenging circumstances to placate locals.OVERALL - This film is one of the best depictions of close quarter fighting since Blackhawk Down and is extremely well handled. Some of the earlier dialogue between the soldiers lets the film down a little bit. Yes, we know soldiers do talk like this from time to time but some of lines are cringeworthy to say the least and I am sure this dialogue could have easily been improved upon, but minor gripes aside the film is a pretty gripping depiction of a stupid military blunder which cost the lives of several young men, completely unnecessarily. It does seem a shame however, that the release of this film, may have torpedoed a second film on the subject (RED PLATOON) based on the book written by Medal of Honour winner Clinton Romesha (Played by Scott Eastwood) - Eastwood was not able to speak to Romesha when researching the role he depicted due to this conflict which feels a real shame. So it is possible, we might see a second film depicting the battle. Bring it on."
"1845","The Outpost",8,"Slow build-up, but bluddy GOOD BATTLE!!","Very much in the mold of Zulu (1964). Love the realism of being in a real war, with ammunition and bombs going off left, right and center, and soldiers forced on extreme survival skills to battle incredible odds. Some fort - surrounded on all sides by mountains. Outpost is 100% certified as a feminist-free GUY popcorn-movie. Was going to give it a 7, but, in the light of that, think I'll give it an 8."
"1846","The Outpost",8,"Great war movie, don't get demotivated by the naysayers","This is a great movie. Indeed there are, but there are a couple of great things about it:this was a movie based on true eventsthe action scenes are exciting and provide an engaging visual fellingthere is no sugar coating, the actions depicted on the movie real and truthfulIt follows a similar line to 13 Hours: The Secret Soldiers of Benghazi, which I liked a lot too. The storytelling around the lives of each soldier are built differently, but the goal here is not to explore the lives of each of them, but to understand the challenges of fighting a war in a place clearly indefensible. There are no protections against the mountains and everyone knows it, even the viewer as you get the first glimpse of the environment the soldiers were put in.I recommend this movie and I think you will like it if you also like movie based on true events."
"1847","The Outpost",9,"One of the most Authentic war films I have seen","Very accurately captures how soldiers interact with one another. The trailer worried me with a few ""Hollywood"" sounding one-liners but the dialogue, action sequences and genuine experience make it very authentic. I really enjoy how the film highlights the various leadership styles and approaches from those in command. This is a great film that I hope gets more attention 9/10."
"1848","The Outpost",NA,"Surprisingly intense","I thought this would be a B movie, but it is actually really good. It is truly intense, and brings you to the outpost where you feel threatened and desperate. I really enjoyed it."
"1849","The Outpost",8,"A story of true valor","This movie (despite its occasional poor reviews) is fantastic. On a film basis, the movie does a great job introducing you to characters you'd want to learn the true story of. I read the book by Clinton Romesha (depicted by Scott Eastwood) last year entitled ""Red Platoon"" and always had an interest in learning more about the events that unfolded that day. This movie, in my opinion, did the book justice. As far as filmography is concerned, it was great. Realistic action, gunfire, explosions, etc. that youd expect to see in a war movie. The added aspect of realism was the trauma that you can see in the actors portrayal of their characters eyes that can only be a glimpse into what they experienced. Watch the movie, read the book, or vice-versa. Just remember the names."
"1850","The Outpost",9,"Wow, this was intense!","This was very well made. Some soldiers that were on the battle participated as actors, giving it even more realism. All actors did an amazing job. They made me stick my eyes to the screen and not blink until the movie was over. The sound engineering was insanely good, as well as the post-production editing. I will not spoil the battle to anyone reading, but I can say that my heart was pumping like I was there.
Great job!I don't understand how this movie has less than 7 stars and also why garbage insignificant ""woke"" movies have the same rating as this one.
Wake up."
"1851","The Outpost",9,"A gripping war movie in the spirit of ""Fury"" where nothing goes right","War movies tend to get it really bad, or get it really right. This one gets it right.More of a docu-drama, than a narrative film, and non-stop ""WTF"" in your face the entire time. You instantly feel for the soldiers who were based in one of the most ill-conceived camps known. The ominous sense of dread and foreboding haunts the first few minutes of the film.There are plenty of ""gotcha"" moments where you think a certain soldier is going to be with you the entire film, only to discover they are not. It's jarring and keeps you on your toes the entire time.The handheld cameras are shaky, but not overly so, and bring you right into the terror that was that fierce battle.Every actor delivers a satisfactory performance, but it is Caleb Landry Jones who delivers an Oscar-worthy performance as Ty Carter. An incredible portrayal which required careful nuance, it's one of the best pieces of casting direction I've seen in a long time.A truly incredible film that will tear you apart, ""The Outpost"" quickly rises to the my top 25 all-time war films ever made."
"1852","The Outpost",8,"not as bad as many people stated","I waited a while before I watched this due the negative reviews on the internet but after seen it I just don't understand thise people.Okay, maybe it's slow in the beginning and there's a lot of scene's you think well, why and how and please explain but once things go wrong at the outpost this is a hell of a movie.Scott Eastwood. in the dark, his eyes and voice are really lik eclint. Said that, back to this flick based on true events. The cruelty of war is shown, friendship and death are so close. Effects are just on the edge of goredom.If you can sit throughout the first 45 minutes then this is really a good movie.
Gore 1/5
Nudity 0/5
Effects 3/5
Story 5/5
Comedy 0/5"
"1853","The Outpost",9,"Finally!","I didn't even know this movie was being made, but I first heard about it when it was touted as a ""pro-America military movie."" I wasn't exactly sure what that meant, but it sounded better than the alternative.I served in Operation Enduring Freedom 7 and 8, in a little Forward Operating Base called FOB Tillman, named after Army Ranger Pat Tillman who died in that area (Paktika Province of Afghanistan, a few kilometers from the Paki border). We were one small Infantry company (A Company, 2/87) in a remote area, which was populated by neutral locals and Taliban forces. The American media called it a ""hot zone,"" and it was. The similarities between the setting in The Outpost and the reality of my unit's experiences are startling. Obviously, I'm a biased reviewer.That being said: I thought this movie was incredible! There were a couple of things I questioned the accuracy of, like soldiers firing full-auto M4s and the somewhat casual behavior of soldiers in an obvious death trap; but overall this movie gets just about everything right. Down to the small details like the water bottle used as counterweights to keep the exterior doors closed, and the local Afghan elder with the red dye in his beard. Those are the kinds of details that SO many Hollywood interpretations overlook. Also, the story this movie relates is an incredible tale of heroism, sacrifice and brotherhood, which really are common in the US military. Watching this film was a cathartic experience for me, as well as an enjoyable movie-going one."
"1854","The Outpost",8,"Excellent war movie up there with the best","Never rated Scott Eastwood thought he was a subpar actor but man was I wrong he is amazing in this movie he shines and was without a shadow of a doubt my favourite character, as for the rest of the cast they all put in an amazing performance and the movie in a whole is just excellent, I love a good war movie and this is just that, trust me just watch it"
"1855","The Outpost",8,"Criminally underrated war masterpiece","This is one of the best war films, of all time. It is extremely intense and almost seems as relentless in the portrayal of war, as the Taliban must have been in their daily skirmishes with the American forces.This tells the story of the most decorated company of the Afghan war, their outpost, which happened to be a tactical blunder surrounded on all sides by the Hindu Kush mountains and their fight to the finish which led to the highest battle honours.There are interesting insights on leadership and the effect that it can have on the subordinates as well as the opponents. Then, there are pointers about the instincts ruling the heart and the mind, in the heat of the battle.It is first rate and it is a real shame that it hasn't received the recognition that it rightfully deserves. among my top 3 films that I have seen this year, pre and post lockdown.
Its rating on Rotten Tomatoes (of 91%) is closer to the quality of the experience.Can't be recommended highly enough. Is in the unmissable category."
"1856","The Outpost",9,"Excellent war film; way underrated","There are a few war-film cliches, but that doesn't make the those scenes unrealistic. And the rest is (to this non-soldier) very real! I don't see how this could have been done better. The actors go all-out, the direction is taut, the action almost non-stop, the effects convincing. Well worth a watch if the subject doesn't simply depress you too much."
"1857","The Outpost",10,"As a Vet. I can say...","Hris movie hit hard to any Vet out there that has been in the thick of things, have lost friends, and has know that they may not come home from the tour. If you thought the opening of Saving privates Ryan was impressive, this is that but for 2 hours long. Highly recommend the movie."
"1858","The Outpost",10,"Great Depiction","This one was hard to watch as a combat vet. I read the book and knew what was going to happen and it still hit hard. The first part of the film was necessary to show life in Army. Yes the dialogue is not PC and civilians may think the behavior is unprofessional. Those boys were very good at their jobs don't worry. Military humor down range is far from PC and Soldiers do a good job in finding humor in almost anything. The final battle is incredible and watching these Soldiers react and make plans under incredible pressure and chaos is amazing. The acting is great and Scott Eastwood was impressive as Romesha."
"1859","The Outpost",8,"The criticism that the movie doesn't develop the 'minor' squad members is patently ridiculous.","I've been watching war movies since the fifties and this is the most rousing-harrowing-insane-based on a real-alamo event war movie I've seen.
Which up till now was the last third of ""Come and See"".
For me, this is essentially the Afghan version of ""ZULU"".
The criticism that the movie doesn't develop the 'minor' squad members is patently ridiculous. The movie is ABOUT them. If anything, this shows why you maybe shouldn't: it hurts when the stuff hits the fan and boy does it hit hard.
A deserved heavy weight of poignance pervades the credits.
Excellent work by Caleb Landry Jones.
Scott Eastwood's DNA causes him to appear to be doing a weak imitation of Clint."
"1860","The Outpost",10,"How did they survive?","One heck if a movie. The fights were real. Quite scary to even think what happened there. We are all lucky to sit here and comment. Brilliant figbtback by the American forces against the taliban. My respect to the soldiers. My rating 10/10"
"1861","The Outpost",9,"Good war movie","I seldom write reviews here but this movie deseves some credit.It was a long time since I saw such good war movie. Good story and visuals. Watch it you will not be dissapointed."
"1862","The Outpost",7,"if your squemish, then make a pass...","Because this is made for the unison , and not the bipartisan of the audience. its a film about usa's war on taliban in afghanistan, it has a very cliched build up with loads of rough and tough language and bullying among compadres en masse. that really is going on for ssome 45 minutes.but when the heat gets hot, i guess youll experience some highraised shoulders and stiffness in the neck, because the ''under attack'' action parts a really dignyfying and deadly to say the least, thanks to handheld free motion camerawork ,so here youre in for some good moviemaking.but there are much mediocreness in the quiet and spiritual moments of the story, and that makes the grumpy old man give just a 7.but if you like the topic and genre, its among the finest made over the subject, and some of the acting are pretty good."
"1863","The Outpost",10,"A small slice of war","This film shows that each soldier is fighting for the person beside them. Shows the madness of working with people that don't want you there, and the incredible relief when the battle is over. Some people may see this as a fairy tale of toxic masculinity. Those people do not know the immense joy of being shot at and missed."
"1864","The Outpost",7,"Good movie, highlights the stupidity of wars","The movie portrays the suffering of young men sent to a part of world they don't understand just because someone on top was too dumb to know better ."
"1865","The Outpost",7,"A surprisingly great war film.","""The Outpost"" is surprisingly a well executed, well acted and intense film about the war in Afghanistan. I was hooked from beginning to end.
.
In this war drama based on a true story, a small team of U.S. soldiers battle against hundreds of Taliban fighters in Afghanistan.
.
Director Rod Lurie takes the viewers inside the outpost rarely ever showing the enemy but always showing the bond between brothers. Scott Eastwood and Caleb Landry Jones are terrific in their roles and the action sequences are pulse-pounding. I started this review off with the word ""surprising""; and being a B-movie I didn't expect much from ""The Outpost"". Turns out I was wrong and you should see this film.
.
Follow @snobmedia for all reviews!"
"1866","The Outpost",7,"Lots of filler, little substance.","I felt like I was playing Call of Duty for 5 hours. A mishmash of battles and irrelevant dialogue, for a basic mission. Sadly, I wasn't participating in this conflict. The realism was excellent, although heavily drawn out by a screenplay that needed to be much tighter. The casting was excellent and I felt although not all performances where great, they were convincingly real and emotional. It's not your typical Hollywood war film, but instead one of true grit war films that honors the real life soldiers that were KIA or able to return home. Your eyes will be glued to the screen, but you'll be left unsatisfied with the overall storytelling."
"1867","The Outpost",8,"So Real !","Well, I really felt so touched and the movie is so great with bravery.
However, the events were so realistic."
"1868","The Outpost",9,"Give the whole cast oscars","Fantastic movie and insight in the terror and fear of war. Incredible acting all around, i really felt the actors were there. They really made this movie, Oscar's all around! Effects and score were on point. Why this movie hasn't got a higher rating is a crime."
"1869","The Outpost",9,"Near perfect.","The relationships. The combat. The dialogue. The tactics. Every little detail is near perfect. Those that are complaining about it not being a typical Hollywood popcorn blockbuster because ""they are all wearing the same uniform Sonora tough to tell who is getting killed and shooting at an empty hillside"" has no clue how the war in Afghanistan was. And that's okay. The violent side of the afghan war has never been better depicted."
"1870","The Outpost",8,"Need more movies like this","It's great to watch a movie without an liberal agenda. This is an American film about Americans. God bless those soldiers. Clint Eastwood's son is really interesting to watch. He looks just like his old man. Well worth the time."
"1871","The Outpost",10,"Possibly the best war movie I've ever seen","Don't get it twisted. This movie will likely go relatively unknown, not unlike the Battle of Kamdesh. I'd first read Staff Sergeant Clint Romesha's book, Red Platoon, of which The Outpost is based upon, in 2016. The book tells the story of the men of Red Platoon stationed at Combat Outpost (COP) Keating, a COP the DoD themselves stated had zero strategic value and was nearly indefensible. Ever since I read the book I've wondered why this story wasn't more widely known and why the book hadn't been made into a movie. I can't be more thrilled that it finally has as this story needs to be as well known as Operation Redwing (Lone Survivor), Day of the Rangers (Black Hawk Down), and Operation Vigilant Resolve and Phantom Fury (The first and second battles of Fallujah respectively).The visual depiction of Staff Sergeant Romesha's book is incredibly true to the text. In the book, Staff Sergeant Romesha doesn't write himself out to be a hero, but instead gives the facts of what happened during the battle and focuses more on the actions of the soldiers he served with. The Outpost mirrors that depiction, showing you that there is no singular main character. The movie is a tribute to the men who fought in the Battle of Kamdesh.If you are looking for a highly polished war story like American Sniper or Lone Survivor, this is not your movie. Having served in the military, I can tell you that the dialogue between service members is very much akin to what is shown in the movie. It is crass. It is disgusting. It is not wholesome. It is irreverent. The movie does an outstanding job of portraying the military experience of ""hurry up and wait"". The first two thirds of the movie are heavy amounts of dialogue, scenes showing soldiers working out, or humping packs up mountains with the occasional firefight that may last 60 seconds.The last scene is a visceral depiction of combat and I feel it does an amazing job portraying the odds that were stacked against the men at COP Keating. You easily empathize with the desperation the men likely fought as they did everything they could to help their brothers in arms and to not lose control of COP Keating. The movie relies heavily on this empathy and very little on gory depictions of violence to grip the viewers emotions and attention. That isn't to say the movie is without bloody depictions of wounds or kills, but it is very tame Compared to other R rated war movies.In something, The Outpost is an outstanding movie that greatly does justice to the story of the Combat deployed service member. I can't recommend this movie highly enough to anyone wanting to try to understand what the military experience is like when bullets aren't flying or to anyone wanting to get an accurate understanding of what it looks like to have everything go wrong during war.Side note, my only gripe is that in the book, Staff Sergeant Romesha tells a story of the JTAC (joint terminal attack controller) directing air assets onto targets. At one point, the JTAC had to take a shit, so was squatted over an empty ammo can as he was calling in bombs. Would have found it hilarious if that had made it into the movie."
"1872","The Outpost",10,"Terrific","I loved every aspect of this movie: the acting, the realism of human interaction, human emotions, the realism of the battle. The characters were so vivid - each was unique, extremely convincing, human. The buildup was necessary in order to properly develop the characters, so that when they finally go into battle and die it impacts you deeply. The fight itself was one of the best, if not the best I've seen.This is a masterpiece.
May those who sacrificed their lives in the battle be forever remembered."
"1873","The Outpost",7,"EXTREMELY FACTUAL","By mistake, I went into this movie with a preconceived notion. That just shows not to judge something before you've seen it. This movie is based on the true story of Camp Keating in the Afghanistan mountains bordering Pakistan. Very realistic scenes, acting was good on an overall basis of the entire cast. It shows how the Pentagon was pressured from above to place an outpost in an area that is indefensible. Which ever top brass decided to place a outpost in the valley surrounded by the Hindu Kush mountains should be stripped of his rank and sent home. If you Enjoy war movies, this is just for you. <U+0001F60E>"
"1874","The Outpost",6,"Fell short","Having read both The Outpost and Red Platoon I was really excited to hear that this story was being considered for theatrical release. I wanted to enjoy it so much but unfortunately I found it falling short of my expectations. The timeline felt very disjointed compared to its written page counterparts. I believe viewers who aren't familiar with what happened or haven't read the books will have trouble establishing a emotional connection with the characters. The Outpost severely lacks character development; as such you aren't able to get to know them intimately so you don't develop a bond with them throughout the course of the film. I gave it three stars because of the authenticity and devotion to the story. I felt the cinematography, special fx & costumes were all extremely well done."
"1875","The Outpost",3,"Better than many war movies","As war movies go, there seems to be little middle ground - they either are well made or low budget disasters .This film does sit in the middle in a way .
It is not a good movie by any standards, but perfectly watchable if your expectations aren't too high .
It is not Black Hawk Down, American Sniper, Hurt Locker, or anywhere near that level of film making .Where The Outpost falls short is the skill and craftsmanship of its creators .
There is a somewhat coherent storyline, but it is filled with stereotypical scenes and dialogue .
The acting is unremarkable for the most part, which is good ; because the few times the cast members are trying to really act, it gets corny and annoying , showing their lack of competence .The movie really falls apart during the second half, when the action happens .
Battle scenes are very hard to do well, and here we have editing, filming, scripting and directing - you name it - that doesn't manage to put together a picture the viewer can follow and be involved in .
It's just a messy pile of repetitive, disjointed shots, repeatedly running the story into dead ends , without the connecting arch good film makers create to turn even chaos into a coherent story .But considering how many really bad war movies there are , I thing this one still deserves a 4/10 , if barely ."
"1876","The Outpost",10,"FIRST TRULY GREAT WAR FILM OF THE 21st CENTURY","The Big Parade, All Quiet on the Western Front, The Story of G.I. Joe, A Walk in the Sun, Pork Chop Hill, Paths of Glory, Saving Private Ryan, From Here to Eternity, Flags of Our Fathers - make no mistake about it, The Outpost will be included alongside each of them whenever the great 'modern' (post-1900) war films are listed and discussed. Like the others, the new Rod Lurie movie balances the anti-war sensibility that any sane person shares with all of humanity with a rousing/worthy tribute to those individual people and 'bands of brothers' (Shakespeare, Henry V) who, as Tennyson said, do not have the option of 'wondering why' they are catapulted into in hell on earth, only that they must 'do or die.' An Alamo like depiction of an actual battle during our never ending war in Afghanistan, Lurie's film (based on a non-fiction book by Jake Tapper of CNN) does not so much document the fighting as it thrusts you into the epicenter of this human storm, the highest compliment any movie on any subject can ever be awarded. Though completed (and originally scheduled for release) in 1919 (long-delayed), we can only hope that The Outpost will be considered for Academy Award nominations for the 2021 Oscars. If it is, watch it sweep the Academy Awards - including a long overdue one for the under-appreciated director!

"1877","The Outpost",5,"Could have been good.","The movie is bad but not that bad.It had a lot of potential but it felt like the dialogue was written by pre-schoolers and the acting was borderline bad. It felt like watching generation kill with bad actors and unnatural like soldier dialogue."
"1878","The Outpost",1,"Not Realistic, Not Factual, Amateur","Any real soldier who fought in AFG or Iraq knows enemies don't run around and yelling or coming to attack like that, or American soldiers talking all corny to each other and to friendly's like a bunch of goofy excited Americans.
Afghans don't look or talk like that. IT WAS ONCE CALLED ARYANA for a reason.
Also copied ending scene from Saving Private Ryan.
IF YOU WANT TO SEE A REAL FILM ABOUT AFGHANISTAN, watch one that is made by a real director, and the best perspectives are from EUROPE.
This director is a joke. The film is a joke. Amateur film.
You get 1 star because it's Eastwood's son."
"1879","The Outpost",10,"Take your mind off the planet movie","Deer Hunter used to be my all time fav number 1 movie. Now it's number 2. This was such a great movie for understanding war and what those soldiers went through. I understand PTSD better now. I have a new appreciation for Memorial Day. Watch the interviews at the end of the soldiers who made it back. I am changed forever."
"1880","The Outpost",4,"Messy","Honestly, how did they get Orlando Bloom and Scott Eastwood signed onto this? The movie is a complete mess! There's no real direction, the writing is poor, acting is really sub par and it's just full of clichés. I didn't feel an attachment to any of the characters and didn't really feel any suspense or anticipation as to how it was going to play out. Just badly written and directed in my opinion."
"1881","The Outpost",8,"Decent, Could've Been Better","This movie hits the high-points in the story of the Battle of Kamdesh. There are some real Army scenarios and stories in the movie but it lacks character development. The book is really long, the movie had to cut a lot of the story to make it ""fit"" within the proposed movie timeline. While the scenery for the movie looks great, and the action scenes are super-intense, more backstory and more development of the characters would've made the story's impact more effective. Yes, I've read the book, so my expectations were high. The movie is definitely worth watching, but the story worth more exploration to give the Soldiers who died proper honor and credit."
"1882","The Outpost",7,"One of the better movies of 2020","I am a fairly well read man and truth be told I did not have the slightest inkling about this particular incident upon which the movie is based. You would assume that the strongest military in the world would be smarter than setting up a Base at the bottom of a valley surrounded by mountains on all sides.This is a story that deserved to be told and kudos to the director for doing exactly that.What irks me is when they try to mislead the audience by promoting a movie using a big name actor(If you can call Orlando Bloom a big name actor) who has a cameo in the movie. Orlando Bloom is in a cameo in the movie but the way the movie is promoted it would seem that he is the main character. As they say, build it and they will come. If you make a good movie the audience will come.Another thing that seriously irked me about the movie is the video game sort of directing. I am old school and that really gets on my nerves. Why repair something that is not broken. What was wrong with the way Saving Private Ryan was shot. Always makes me wonder if they benefitted in any way by doing something to appease a certain audience. How many video game addicts out there said....we dont generally watch movies but because the director made a movie that is shot like a video game we made an exception and watched it. I bet nobody did.Other than that its a really good movie. Definitely one of the best movies to have released since the Theater lockdown."
"1883","The Outpost",8,"An awesome war movie..!!","Thrilling, Emotional, Realistic and some great acting."
"1884","The Outpost",8,"Awesome <U+0001F44D><U+0001F44D>","Two thumbs up! Intense action and great acting. I've watched a lot of Afghanistan war films and this is up there with one of the best. Hats off to Caleb and the rest of the crew. Definitely worth a watch. Would of been great to watch this on the big screen. Unfortunately this film will lay in my hidden gem category."
"1885","The Outpost",9,"Nonstop battle","Thanx for the crew for such an amazing movie experience."
"1886","The Outpost",7,"well worth the watch","A bit slow at the start ... but wow what a fire fight ......"
"1887","The Outpost",8,"Totally amazing and historically accurate.","I've always had a knack for biopic movies. There's a feeling of relatability. And this was one movie one could relate with coupled with the fact it dealt with historical accounts of soldiers in the Afgan war.
The transitions were totally spot on. Granted the dialogue could have been better, but it was a great effort."
"1888","The Outpost",5,"All over the place","If you like the general theme you will like this movie. Though if you like continuity and getting to know the characters then you might not. To me it was just a bunch of decent scenes in Afghanistan in random order."
"1889","The Outpost",10,"Great movie","Great movie everything and all actors were on point, sad story but needs to be told"
"1890","The Outpost",5,"Overlong, so and so cliché, War drama","""The Outpost"" is based on a non-fiction book of the same name by Jake Tapper, which details the Battle of Kamdesh, one of the bloodiest battles for US forces in the Afghan region. But, with the B outfit 'Screen Media Films' handling distribution, ""The Outpost"" was doomed to a VOD release even before COVID-19 closed movie theaters indefinitely. Everything here feels familiar, while director rarely digs below the surface of the individuals fighting in it. You will like the movie, only if you are an American with strong military connections, because film fails to capitalize on any broader theme, while winds up feeling stuck and restless. Yes, things change, people argue and are killed, but here there is no broader message - it didn't even documented at all how human (US Generals) errors led to the loss of life. Without that kind of overarching strategy, movie falls to pieces, much like the combat outpost it portrays.Rating: 5- (If you want really to enjoy modern Acton/War thrilling movie ""Lone Survivor"" is a much, much better option)"
"1891","The Outpost",1,"Absolutely over rated movie","The only reason I am writing this comment is because I tend to pay attention to the ratings movies get. So, obviously with an 8.7 rating and over a 100 reviews I expected a way over average experience. especially since the movie was apparently based on a true story. There wasn't any need for an understanding of the English language though. I have never ever heard the f word in so many forms and situations. This actually made the movie unwatchable for me as I do not believe this is the way soldiers would speak to each other 100% of the time. And since the dialogue is an important part of any movie it made watching this one impossible."
"1892","The Outpost",3,"Low Budget, horrible acting","REALLY low-budget movie. A bunch of random talking and messing around with very brief scenes of shooting at an enemy that is barely even SHOWN! Orlando Bloom is pretty boring in the 30 minutes he is even in the movie. The rest of the actors are pretty horrible."
"1893","The Outpost",1,"Horrible!","This is a bad movie! Horribly made, total waste of good actors like Orlando Bloom and Scott Eastwood!Do waste your time, watch some other war movies instead!"
"1894","The Outpost",6,"Chances of remembering ""The Outpost"" are as slim as the battalion's plight to defend it","""The Outpost"" is about as average a war film as you can get. It tackles a true story in a well-known war. In this case, it covers an American battalion outpost surrounded by mountainous regions in Afghanistan and the seemingly hopeless predicament they are in after each of their commanding officers reach their end sooner than expected. The cast that we follow within said battalion have personalities and motivations that are not uncommon in most war flicks I have seen in the modern era of filmmaking. And of course, there is going to be a big battle at the climax. It is an unwritten rule in war films seemingly that there must be some sort of set piece for both sides to fight it out against each other.Basically, what I am saying is that if you have seen every war film in the past 20 years, then you have seen ""The Outpost"". To better highlight the standout moments, allow me to list off the highlights this film. The film does give us a sense of ambience and atmosphere early on by showing us the environment in which our battalion is up against. An environmental shot from the ground depicting the height of the surrounding mountain areas around the titular outpost our battalion resides in shows us why these soldiers are worried about any further attacks from the Taliban. Any moment, there could be multiple snipers reigning fire down on their compound.All that communication is done through visuals and text, so we do not need to be explained why this is a hellhole. There are also a few individual snippets of inspired human interactions and situations. There is a hilarious moment where one guy who is caught masturbating to another trooper's photo of their wife and is forced to do push-ups as punishment. You also got a trooper who was about to strip down and shower instantly being forced to shoot at the Taliban in defense of their surprise attack. In case you wonder where the term ""going commando"" might originate from, this is certainly one source. As a piece of filmmaking, ""The Outpost"" is competent enough for what it is.I must confess however in the scenes of gunplay when you have the Americans shooting at the Taliban, you cannot tell what they are shooting at most of the time. If the only visual evidence I have of the Americans killing the Afghans is through a couple individual shots through the gun's crossfire, I am not quite convinced that the threat is really there in those battle scenes. To be fair, it is a very real possibility that this is the intention from the get-go. The cast is serviceable, with the likes of Scott Eastwood and Orlando Bloom being the most famous names within the ensemble. No notable standouts though either. Mainly because the characters themselves are fairly generic and cookie-cutter for my taste.The rate this is going so far, it would be something of a miracle if I were to remember this after a whole week had passed. It is not due to a lack of expertise or craftsmanship mind you. It is more due to the intense competition of war films released within the past two decades. And for what ""The Outpost"" brings to the table, there is not enough mind-blowing inspiration or challenging ideas and perspectives to be found in this title like there was in ""Saving Private Ryan"". This film's chances of being remembered past a one-time rental are about as slim as the battalion's chances of justifying the purpose of the aforementioned outpost within the walls of Afghanistan. In other words, do not hold your breath."
"1895","The Outpost",6,"Beautiful and exciting war drama only with less developed soldier characters.","The Outpost is a new war drama movie directed by Rod Lurie, the director of Nothing But the Truth and The Contender.The film is about the American mission of a small group of soldiers consisting of 53 men, who defend the remote outpost Keating against the Taliban in Afghanistan. In this way they hope to support and defend the local population during social projects. When the US military decides to close outpost Keating, the remaining soldiers are surprised by a major attack by the Taliban. The soldiers must now protect the outpost and the population for the last time against an invasion of hundreds of Taliban fighters.Director Rod Lurie and photography director Lorenzo Senatore have portrayed the film in a good and exciting way. This makes it feel as if you, as a viewer, are also part of the small group of American soldiers, who are often attacked by surprise attacks by the Taliban. The film feels a bit like the war films The Hurt Locker and 1917. This film also shows well what life-threatening missions soldiers can experience and why some of these soldiers have received the Medal of Honor.Although the film is beautifully portrayed, you quickly forget who plays which soldier and what they are called. Only the more famous actors such as Orlando Bloom and Scott Eastwood can be recognized earlier in the film thanks to their fame. Despite this unfamiliarity of the cast, as staff sergeant Ty Carter, Caled Landry Jones still manages to put in good acting in the film and almost carries the film."
"1896","The Outpost",9,"Oscar worthy movie!","Great scenes with amazing camera work. All of the actors are great! This movie really gives you the feeling you are in the middle of the highly realistic fight. Definitely recommend this movie to everyone."
"1897","The Outpost",3,"Great movie for falling asleep","I can't believe there's actually people in this world who enjoyed this movie.
Watch it and see for yourself. This movie is boring AF."
"1898","The Outpost",10,"One of the Best Action Packed War Movies Made!","Very accurate depiction of the Afghanistan war. Action packed and great character development. Will not disappoint!! Easily up there with Fury and Zero Dark Thirty! A must watch!!"
"1899","The Outpost",7,"Nice movie, but lacks essence","The movie is well-made, the acting, directing and script is fine, but the idea of building military outposts in hostile Afghan territory, and in the open and poorly defended valley is just ridiculous. Therefore, taking into account the fact this is a serious military movie based on the true story that wants to pay respects to those brave soldiers who fought and died there doesn't make any sense. The essence of the movie is just lost.Regarding true story part, historically Afghanistan was never conquered nor ruled. There are many years of struggle with Taliban and thousands of foreign soldiers lost. Building such an outpost in the hostile territory is just silly. All those families who lost their members there should question intellect of those who sit in Pentagon."
"1900","The Outpost",9,"FRIGHTENING","I was really expecting a cheap VOD B-Movie, but this is actually a pretty harrowing film. I don't know how 'realistic' this movie actually is, but it definitely had me on edge.There's not much character development, but (to me) it didn't feel lacking. It's really the building sense of dread that gets to you. All of these guys are gonna die.Watching guys trying to pull their wounded to cover while taking fire is something you see in every war movie...but the difference is that in this film, the camera just keeps rolling without a cut, pulling you in to the moment even moreso - and watching this on a big TV makes a difference. The camera follows as guys repeatedly run through a hail of gunfire to resupply their defenses, and you're right there with them. It's as close to a first person experience as you'll get.The Outpost is probably the best in it's category. It's way better than that stupid Mark Wahlberg movie, and probably has an edge up on Black Hawk Down."
"1901","The Outpost",8,"The good the bad and the ugly","It was a tragedy that they were put in such a position by their commanders. It was a story of heroism and the bond that soldiers have in their commitment to fulfill any mission at all costs. The realism, acting, and production were incredibly well done. I finished with tears in my eyes, wishing I could run out on the combat field and help them get out and back home safely. A reminder of the gratitude we owe the men and woman who so proudly serve our country."
"1902","The Outpost",5,"One sided view of the conflict.","It always takes the United States to create a war movie where the only views, the only glorification goes to one side and the other side is reduce to figures in the background.Going from soldier to soldier, what they were doing during the movie you soon realize that what you are seeing is a movie that kind of tells the story in reverse, that is the United States is not actually invading a country but the Taliban are trying to invade them.As always the word ""insurgent"" is used a lot to diminish the enemy, trying to take away the fact they have as much if not many times over more courage for fighting with the very basic gear and most of the time without nightvision and obviously with little to no intel and no air support and almost no heavy shelling support.Yes, they are scumbags, the Talibans are just scums that think women are worthless but... it is up to each and every country to decide on their own what is right and what wrong, not up to us. And yes, they are SOLDIERS not insurgents, they are fighting a foreign invaders and they are not backing down which makes them heroes for their countries and very much in all rights soldiers of a real army."
"1903","The Outpost",6,"Very good...","""The Outpost"" is a Drama - History movie in which we watch a group of U.S. soldiers fighting in a very bad location against Taliban fighters in Afghanistan. There were hundreds of Taliban fighters against only a few U.S. soldiers.I liked this movie because it was based on a true event that happened in Afghanistan and it meant a lot the defending of that specific spot because it was representing much more than a simple location. The direction which was made by Rod Lurie it was very good and I believe that he presented very well the whole concept of the movie before the beginning of the battle something that made us understand very well the location and the main characters. Regarding the interpretations of the cast, I have to say that Caleb Landry Jones' who played as Specialist Ty Carter made one of his best performances so far. Some other interpretations that have to be mentioned were Scott Eastwood's who played as Staff Sergeant Clint Romesha and Orlando Bloom's who played as CPT Benjamin Keating, and they were both simply amazing. I strongly recommend everyone to watch this movie because it is not just another war movie but much more than this and yo will understand that only if you watch it."
"1904","The Outpost",9,"Shows the true boredom and terror of combat","11 year army veteran. This rates in my top 3 films for realism and truth to the combat experience. Uniforms to terminology, they nailed it. Thank you for making this film and putting in the research."
"1905","The Outpost",8,"Another Ambitious, Deeply Personal Piece by Rod Lurie","The Outpost of the title was a U.S. military site designed to enlist residents in social expansion, but was located at the base of high mountains just miles from the border. U.S. and local soldiers and advisers would confront a never-ending loom of attack by rebels, who ultimately decided to make a statement.The key to this story and the way it is told is found in how completely unpredictably and abruptly the exchange of fire must be in warfare, especially in this precarious scenario. This is a defining feature of this movie, in its structure, in its suspense and in its character dynamics. The characters in Rod Lurie's The Outpost are young who may generally share the same age bracket but who are nonetheless at varying staging of life, displaced and frustrated guys who will be chewing the fat one second and covering their comrades in the next, against totally unseen enemies.I can only hope that movie-fan enthusiasm had a role to play in the casting of Clint Eastwood's son, Mel Gibson's son and Mick Jagger's son. They vary in their level of presence, but the film never conventionally signals when someone more ""important"" than someone else is on-screen. Everyone stacks up with each other, and they're all naturalistically revealed. Scott Eastwood, for one, has countless moments during which he must do something mortally risky while exposing his crippling fears, born out of empathy and experience.I'm aware that many professional reviews agree that Caleb Landry Jones steals it. There is no denying that.
What viewers need to know is that performance in a movie this maturely crafted, this carefully pragmatic about its potentially sensationalized subject matter, is not about centering any one character. Rod knows particularly well how loyal and synergetic soldiers are in platoons, squadrons and outposts.Jones is an inspired thread the film holds from the start to its final, crushing cut to black. Lurie understands how we all feel about the possibility of being involved in warfare, and how far out of one's element we would look to the rest of our squadron. The gift Jones gives us is the deeply felt human response to being in the very thick of the situation. He is alienated by the squad, because he is not like them. He wouldn't seem especially weird were it not for the fact that he is surrounded by ""proper"" pedigrees of American warrior.But somehow, in a brutal, tragic war film, there are no bad guys. No single deed is without dimension. Lurie has always been specific and definite in his choices. Here it is in how carefully everything plays out before an anxious camera which seems to be a silent addition to the cast.We are left with a story that is so compelling because no matter how immersed we become in it, how inescapable the thick of it feels, it is a needle in the haystack of stories like it, and other stories at other tiers of what has happened since we put troops in Afghanistan. One of the most important reasons why it is not an action-packed film, despite how sudden, brutal and prolonged the battle sequences are, is because it takes the time to show us regime change in a microcosm, how leadership matters, and affects what happens to those depending on it. It's a lesson we can all afford to take time to understand, for what should be terribly obvious reasons."
"1906","The Outpost",5,"It's ok but...","I guess you could say it's realistic but how is it possible to place the outpost on a location like that? Also, organization and preparation in the camp seemed to be surprizingly poor, compare to what you would expect from US forces. Probably, the real troops acted more professionally in a extremely difficult situation than the characters in the movie who seem to rely more on luck than training."
"1907","The Outpost",7,"Decent BoTS militarior","(BoTS: based on true story) This was a decent dramatization of an actual US-Afghan battle for Camp Keating placed vulnerably in a valley surrounded by hostile forces. It's engaging on many fronts since you get to know about actual military battle culture, comraderie, heroism, foolishness, discipline and the lack thereof, etc - there's just so much to be aware of in watching such a film. Don't be surprised when you and those you watch with are full of ""why this?"" and ""why that?"" Some of which is answered with the epilogue. Make no mistake, it's stressful to watch this, especially the final Taliban assault on the post, but it's good to be aware of such events occurring out there, overseas on our behalf."
"1908","The Outpost",6,"Good movie, but not completely accurate","Good movie and gives an insight to what our troops endure. Not accurate though, it combines a 3-4 year timeline to tell the story. Keating was already dead and 2 other Army groups had occupied the base before 3-61. They weren't there when he was. I understand wanting to try and tell the whole story of the place, but Keating's story could've been told or shown separate. It tells the story, but not chronologically. It leaves out the stories of Bostick and Yllescas that set up what happens there also. Read The Outpost and Red Platoon and you'll get the full story and true timeline"
"1909","The Outpost",8,"A must watch movie","One of the best war action movie. I personally felt as if I was on the scene and could feel it happening in front of me. Definitely an 8 out of 10
For me it is in the likes of Black Hawk Down"
"1910","The Outpost",9,"A magnificent war film based on a true story.","* There are documentary scenes starting at the mid-end credit *The director Rod Lurie and crew brought magnificently to life a war film based on a true story about soldiers battling to survive against Taliban fighters in an outpost. I have watched many war films and this one made it to my top three, it felt so real as it can be. From the moment it started I instantly felt the greatness I was about to watch. The tension never stopped building up due to an unstoppable threat lurking all around them, what a terrifying feeling not knowing when they are going to be shot at and it captures the reality of it. The way they focus on the soldiers had a sense of truth by exploring what they do when they off duty giving them personality and how they miss home. Some are attached to what they left behind while others are focused on their mission to survive for what they left behind. The introduction of them was necessary for one not to only have a real war perspective but to get emotional when death comes. It shows how they look out for each other no matter even if they don't like one another, from the moment the mission starts all of that fades away and each of them tries their hardest to protect one another. It also explores how the chain of command keeps one in check of making a better decision due to rank, sadly it is something that happens everywhere, no matter what is right, following orders by rank is an obligation in which by this case could lead to victory or to disaster. The best line this movie had was: ""don't rush for failure"", something to be reminded of every day.The composer Larry Groupé brought one of the best suspenseful music. I have mentioned how I knew from the start that I was going to love this film and it was truly thanks to the music. So perfect for this kind of story, especially since it focuses so much on the tension, this music amplified the intensity with a haunting theme.The cast was perfection, everyone performed incredibly especially Orlando Bloom. I will honestly say that I was never truly a fan, yes he is a good actor but his name in a movie never had me looked twice at it until now. This performance was his best I have ever seen and he deserves an Oscar! The way he portrayed his character made me believe every word, I would have followed his commands without question."
"1911","The Outpost",7,"Really good movie","Its been a while since I watched a war movie that gave me goose bumps when the end credits rolled but this one certainly did. Hacksaw ridge was the last film to do that. This film stars Clint Eastwood's son and the more well known actor Orlando Bloom. Basic plot as a group of American soldiers are stationed in the most stupidly positioned Outpost that leaves them as sitting ducks to the Taliban as the Outpost is completely surrounded by huge hills on nearly all sides. The first half of the film does well at drawing you into the characters and the action is enough to keep you interested as the plot unfolds. The second half is all out war watching the soldiers defending their Base against 100s of Taliban who have them surrounded. Remember to watch the end credits!"
"1912","The Outpost",4,"Scott, act like your father in this scene.","He will never be Clint, especially when he just re-enacts scenes his father did. The movie is good and tells a story of the men in combat, but the acting is far from anything worthy of their counterparts. Bargain bin pick-up if nothing else is available."
"1913","The Outpost",10,"Great Film","Get your popcorn and something to support your jaw, coz it drops alot in this seat of your pants gripping war film.Feel lucky you live the comfortable life you do, because someone else does this stuff so you don't need to."
"1914","The Outpost",9,"Authentic and Immersive Movie about Counterinsurgency Warfare in Afghanistan","The Outpost is a meticulously crafted telling of a story about fighting a counterinsurgency at Camp Keating, Afghanistan. The movie adaptation from Rod Lurie of sections of the book 'The Outpost' by Jake Tapper achieves two incredible feats. First, it honors the sacrifice and service of the Soldiers who served at Camp Keating and fought in the Battle of Kamdesh, by being gritty and authentic. Second, it translates and preserves the atmosphere, emotion, sacrifice and heroic events that occurred on that tiny patch of remote land for anyone who watches the film. The Outpost is a true work of art that gives the world a window into the authentic American Soldier and demonstrates the power of being willing to lay down your life for another."
"1915","The Outpost",4,"Did not enjoy this one....agree with the low ratings","I enjoy watching a good war film if it is done properly. I have seen many war movies over the years and this one ranks low. I thought the script was poorly written and I didn't feel connected to the characters. The story was confusing, a mess to say the least. The foul language was constant throughout the movie and in every conversation by every soldier...really? As a female, I don't mind a few foul words every now and then in a war movie but this was too much, in so much I had to turn down the volume because I found it very distracting. I was very disappointed and was sorry that I rented this one. The only thing I found interesting was the ending credits of the interviews of the real soldiers and the photo line up."
"1916","The Outpost",4,"low budget feel.","Filmed in Bulgaria for $18,000,000, this movie has a definite low budget feel. There is little action on-screen other than cheap smoke effects. Cinematographer Lorenzo Senatore has been the head cameraman for literally about two dozen terrible SyFy movies, almost all shot in Bulgaria on a microbudget and this one isn't a big step up quality-wise. Eric Johnson's (the writer of The Fighter) screenplay is pretty solid but it still feels flat, the dialogue comes off as trite mainly due to, well, not great acting. There is a lot of run-of-the-mill, realistic army banter that needs a good actor's magic to come to life and it's dull without it. Caleb Landry Jones is great but Orlando Bloom adopts a bizarre fake southern accent he seems to have learned from 80s movies and Scott Eastwood comes off sounding too much like his dad. All in all not a terrible movie, but closer to Windtalkers than Saving Private Ryan. It has a good story but suffers from low production value."
"1917","The Outpost",5,"Nothing Really","Poor acting and low cost visual effects make the movie to just watchable one. You feel like fast forwarding the gun fights because they really miss the stunt"
"1918","The Outpost",8,"Good movie, feel the heat within a desperate battle!","This one was really intense. If you like war movies and battles with valorous men, this one is for you. Great effects and camera work, actors really deliver."
"1919","The Outpost",8,"two thumbs up from this combat veteran","A realistic movie about the hell that is combat. Clint Eastwood's son gives an amazing performance here, close your eyes and listen to Clint .. awesome. To all the people that think combat is like a video game and wants to defund military, watch this!"
"1920","The Outpost",10,"Captivating","This movie teachers you a lot about military discipline and management style. Absolutely heroic fight war. Salute!! You will not be disappointed, go on and watch it and enjoy it"
"1921","The Outpost",9,"Riveting","The film is beautifully acted and we'll shot. The battle sequences are realistic and intense. It is one of best war films I've seen in a long while."
"1922","The Outpost",7,"Come for the second half, stay for the first","The Outpost was directed by Rod Lurie, written by Eric Johnson which adapted the book by Jake Tapper and Paul Tamasy, and stars Scott Eastwood, Caleb Landry Jones, Jacob Scipio, Taylor John Smith, Alfie Stewart, Jack Kesy, Scott Alda Coffey, Milo Gibson, Kwame Patterson, Sharif Dorani, Bobby Lockwood, and Orlando Bloom. It follows the soldiers of Camp Keating (ne Kamdesh) as they deal with their position, anger, and Taliban.Plotting is straightforward and kept at a slower pace for the first hour, keeping the audience in the mindset and the boots of the soldiers, following their daily activities: scouting, intelligence, camaraderie, tension, and leadership. The focus is always on their thoughts, they start out with Lt. Keating (Bloom) who is a strong and down-to-Earth leader who tries to make peace with everyone as best he can. When out on an assignment, something happens which causes him to be replaced by Yllescas (Gibson) who loses some of the relatability that made the soldiers appreciate Keating. After Yllescas comes Broward (Patterson) who almost none of the soldiers like due to his nervousness and unwillingness to side or associate with his men. It's this constant demoralization and increasing attacks by the Taliban that keeps the first half arresting. The second half is hectic, kinetic, horrifying action. It does not stop and it does not feel fake, the pressure is felt on all of the characters when the Taliban forces start their assault and it only ever lets up at the end.Characterization was very good, particularly Romesha, Carter, Bundermann, and Kirk (Eastwood, Jones, Smith, and Kesy). They're all given adequate backstory and ample personality in order to stand out among the others. Romesha is quiet, to the point, and an excellent leader. Carter is probably the most interesting of the bunch with his prior professions being brought up, how he ended up in camp Keating, and why next to no one likes him. Bundermann is sort of a hybrid of the stereotypical American soldier and officer; he loves to insult his colleagues, get dirty, and have fun but is also entirely capable of stepping up when necessary. All of the performances are good, with Eastwood and especially Jones standing out as fantastic. The rest of the cast is solid, despite the audience having to play a game of remember-the-last-name since there are so many.For a war film, there is a lack of a message, which is surprising considering the subject matter. It works very well which is bamboozling to say the least. The Outpost has no intention of trying to sway the audience's view towards the conflict one way or the other which allows for greater clarity of the events. It focuses on the soldiers for the whole feature and it never once feels preachy; only intending to tell the story and put the audience in the shoes (or combat boots, rather.) of the soldiers to try and give perspective to outsiders. These men just wanted to be done with that outpost and it shows with the writing and the performances.Budgetary restraints do not lessen the impact of The Outpost, but they are clear at points. The explosions, costume design, layout of the camp, and sound design are top notch for any war film and it is clear that a lot of time and thought went into each building and each technical detail of the movie. One aspect that shines the brightest in this movie is the sound design: it's terrific and terrifying all at the same time. Gunshots feel lethal and close when they hit, explosions are loud and bass-y. And you know what? Bulgaria makes a convincing substitute for Afghanistan. The only thing that makes the budget clear is the overt clarity of the images in that the movie looks as though it was untouched in post, which could've done with some better grading, and the CGI which is pretty subpar. Thankfully the CG is rare and the grading doesn't take much away from the movie. The pacing is a bit on the slow side for the first half; which can drag at points and may have benefitted from a light bit of trimming. All together though, The Outpost is a very well made movie.As a whole: The Outpost isn't the best war movie, with pacing issues in the beginning and innumerable characters to follow, but it is certainly a solid one. The story is interesting, action is brutal, most of the characters are well-defined and easy to sympathize with, and has strong technical aspects. I recommend The Outpost as a well done, and well told story.72/100"
"1923","The Outpost",8,"Great movie!","Beautiful cinematography.
Camerawork is superb so is directing and acting.
Started slow and built up to some of the best action."
"1924","The Outpost",6,"Read. The. Book. First!","After reading the book (Also on Audible) I was excited for this movie. Unfortunately the script jumps around way too much. The audience never gets a chance to connect to the actual story or soldiers. This movie could of been sooo much better. My advise is to read the book or listen to it in audible, then watch this movie. Otherwise it's just far too confusing and average war movie at best."
"1925","The Outpost",6,"Blackhawk Down wanabee","Some decent action scenes but lacks something. Acting is not great but perhaps that has something to do the lifeless script and fairly anonymous characters. Orlando gets no more than a cameo and the only other person who sticks in the mind is Scott Eastwood. Action is pretty well done with a definite hint of Zulu in terms of the story."
"1926","The Outpost",6,"Low budget, poor quality","Too bad, since the Romesha's book is actually good. Not as good as Sean Parnell's ""Outlaw Platoon"" but still good.And if you read the book, like me, it is unbearable to see how badly the director and the military advisor did their work.Could be a nice 50 minutes episode of a National Geographic series about Afghanistan but a movie .... geeez. 6 stars is even too much."
"1927","The Outpost",3,"Why exaggerate the truth when the truth is hard enough.?","As far as recent war movies go, this is up there in great cinematography, acting and authenticity. Although there are scenes when the enemies seem to be bullet proof or the US soldiers are bad shots, The big let down is the exaggeration and embellishing of the truth.
This movie is based on an actual event... I emphasize the word ""based"" as it ventures far from the actual event.
I could not for a moment imagine one of the actual veterans of that event watching the movie and say ""nailed it"". No way. Clearly obvious or at least obviously lacking are veterans themselves not in the credits as advisers.There are combat scenes that do not at all match the reality of that battle, but certainly make for a good war movie.why why why do US film makers keep making movies about the war in Afghanistan keep portraying Afghan (Taliban) as poor shots, badly trained and appearing dumb? That is/was never the case in reality.My opinion is that this is an entertaining movie of the war in Afghanistan but in regards to accuracy, it could be perhaps be compared to a Yogi Bear cartoon as a documentary about Grizzly Bears. Maybe that is a harsh description, but the film makers certainly have ventured far from the truth.I give it only 3 stars for saying it is an accurate depiction when it is not."
"1928","The Outpost",10,"Insane & So Good","Hard to imagine going through this! This movie in my opinion was very well put together and I was at the edge of my seat from the start. Highly recommend watching and I truly appreciate all those who have/are putting their lives on the line for our freedom."
"1929","The Outpost",10,"Our bravest dying to protect our country","While some are losing their lives to protect our country and the american people,
some choose the internet and fight behind their computer keyboard to destroy our lives and our country.
This an amazing movie about what america is all about, relentless courage and determination in face of the enemy, BRAVO"
"1930","The Outpost",6,"Nice, well done movie","The outpost starts slowly. It makes you thing OH God, this is another heroic patriotic movie with lots of cursing, but gets better and at the end becomes really intresting."
"1931","The Outpost",3,"The Outpost vs. 9th Company","The movie is not bad, you can watch. On the other hand, I'm sorry for the director of The Outpost, the filmmakers, but the Afghan war film called 9th Company can't be overwritten. Hollywood needs to train a little more."
"1932","The Outpost",6,"A decent looking set surrounded by green screen","There's way too much green screen in this movie, it's jarring"
"1933","The Outpost",10,"A wave of a film that will keep crashing","In my house, it was silent when this film ended. That doesn't happen often with streaming movies. The true achievement of this film is the heart and soul and heroism that's interjected between the white-knuckle action. Rarely do films strike such a fine balance. So many people are talking about this on social media, I'd expect the wave of The Outpost enthusiasm to grow and grow. Well deserved!"
"1934","The Outpost",7,"Average standard movie with no excitement","Some of the stories are seen no logical and director had failed to grasp the attention. Its too exaggerated to show that they are angels and the locals are bad devils."
"1935","The Outpost",10,"Wow","I went in with relatively low expectations but this was great. If they had added some Lone Survivor music would have been better perhaps. Cinematography was like Black Hawk Down and acting was top notch. Loved Eastwood's character but even the last scene was a tear jerker. There were a lot of characters, but you still get to hear about their general personal stories. I hear a lot about one shot filmography but this worked awesome how it was used. Big recommend and also loved seeing the younger sons bring out their fathers' acting characteristics like Gibson's as well."
"1936","The Outpost",10,"Movie of the Year (Covid 19 Outbreak)","One of the best movie. I cried at last. It's not like playing PUBg or COD.
Man..! It's real a thing..!Salute Marines..! Semper Fi..!"
"1937","The Outpost",10,"War movies, yes","War movies are thrilling, at least for us men. Haven't seen such an intense battle for a while. Good job."
"1938","The Outpost",8,"Much better than expected","Watching the trailer I thought this looked better than your average military action flick, but trailers are nothing if not often deceiving, so I was cautiously optimistic.
Also, many low-to-mid budget military action films tend to have unrealistic characters and dialogue, so I was worried about that as well.
Happy to say that this movie really surprises you, in the best possible way.
I went into it somewhat familiar with the real life events, but if you aren't you'll probably won't know who's going to die and who'll survive.
What I particularly liked is the slow cook pacing, which sprinkles just enough action and tension up until the big battle to keep you engaged. The characters pretty much ALL felt real and flawed, and the dialogue felt incredibly natural, mixed with real military jargon that helped legitimize it more. The trailer present it as though this whole movie is one big action scene, when it reality the first half is the lead up to the terrible scenario that unfolds. I loved how they show the outpost morale being affected with each new CO, and they truly managed to capture the essence of occupying an isolated outputs where you're constantly having to deal with periods of boredom interrupted by intense near death scenarios. Not to mention, having to put up with centralized command and all the often inept bureaucracy of the higher ups. A poor execution of this idea would lead to a slow paced movie, but this is not the case. Not every scene is action-packed, but there is tension throughout most, and the flow is consistent and doesn't drag at all. They did a great job conveying the comradely and dissent between the soldiers (yes, those two things can co-exist). All in all, it felt A LOT more realistic than what I was expecting, and I was very much engaged. From what I understand they had real people from the actual outpost help them during filming and some even played extras. Worth the watch and then some! A very well-crafted glimpse of the outpost soldier's life, the frustration, feeling of helplessness, and outright terror and suddenness of combat. Battle scenes looked good for the most part. I can see the director was ambitious and wanted to show as much as he could from an up-and-personal POV. Didn't always work for me. You can nitpick on some stuff but I enjoyed the first half enough that the second half felt engaging even if I didn't love all the shots. Actors all did a great job throughout. Enjoyed this ride more than I thought I would."
"1939","The Outpost",4,"Worst ! ! !","This is probably the worst war movie I ever watched..."
"1940","The Outpost",4,"Disappointing","A lot of awkward acting and clichés. The only one bringing anything real to this is Caleb Landry Jones. Otherwise a waste of time, which is a shame because it is definetively a true war story worth telling."
"1941","The Outpost",10,"Brilliant war movie based on a real battle","Starts off a little slow but once the attack starts it's pretty intense watch the end credits as the real soldiers tell their story"
"1942","The Outpost",7,"puts us in it","Greetings again from the darkness. Director Rod Lurie's latest is not only based on a remarkable true story, it uses the real American soldier's names (and some real soldiers) and depicts the valiant efforts of those who were part of the Battle of Kamdesh in Afghanistan on October 3, 2009. Mr. Lurie (THE CONTENDER, 2000) is a West Point graduate and Army veteran, and the film is based on the book by CNN correspondent Jake Tapper, with a screenplay from Eric Johnson and Paul Tamasy.We first meet the new arrivals on their helicopter transport under the cover of darkness. They have been assigned to this combat outpost known as ""Camp Custer."" The nickname comes from the assumption that everyone there is going to die. Why is that? Well for some reason, this military outpost is positioned so as to be surrounded by the foothills of a mountain range - creating a natural shooting gallery of which the soldiers are sitting ducks. It's one of the most vulnerable military outposts ever created, and with it comes so many Taliban attacks that the soldiers can't even take seriously their local scout's constant warnings, ""The Taliban are coming!""There are 53 soldiers assigned to the camp, and the aura of impending doom hovers non-stop. To compensate, joking around and playing sports are utilized to pass the time between attacks. The men even debate whether calling home is a good thing or not. One of the bunk beds has ""It doesn't get better"" carved into the frame - that's a taste of the kind of inspiration floating around. ""Thank you for your service"" is pure parody amongst these soldiers, and it's easy to understand, given the tension they must feel - we are nervous merely watching from the safety of an armchair.The performances are solid and you'll recognize a few. Orlando Bloom is Lieutenant Keating, Scott Eastwood is Sergeant Cline Romesha, and Caleb Landry Jones is a standout as Carter, the ex-Marine outcast who is more complex than initial impressions lead us to believe. On an unusual note, the list of ""relateds"" is quite impressive: Eastwood is of course the son of Clint, Milo Gibson is the son of Mel, James Jagger is the son of Mick, Will Attenborough is the grandson of Sir Richard Attenborough, and Scott Alda Coffey is the grandson of Alan Alda.Director Lurie divides the film into chapters associated with officers, but the segment that most every viewer will find riveting is the near-40 minute attack on the outpost by hundreds of Taliban gunmen. It's relentless battle action at a level rarely seen in movies, and we feel like we are in the middle of it. This onslaught feels like hopelessness, followed by desperation, followed by survival mode. Never does it feel like an outright victory, but more a relief for those who survive. Cinematographer Lorenzo Senatore makes this a visceral experience - one we won't forget.Very little politics come into play here. Instead this is about the men in the line of fire - their courage - and their desperate attempts to live and hold the outpost. All of which is followed by a haunting breakdown that stuns. This battle resulted in 8 dead and 27 injured American soldiers, followed by many medals, including two Medal of Honors. The closing credits honor those killed in action, and we see photos of the actual soldiers next to the actor who played them."
"1943","Kajillionaire",10,"Wacky and heart rending","This film is so wacky that you don't fully appreciate the deep dive into human relationships until the end of the film. The acting, especially from Evan Rachel Wood is unexpectedly brilliant. And the writing from Miranda July is her best yet. I laughed until my heart broke."
"1944","Kajillionaire",9,"Plenty of Laughs With a Lot of Heart","What a wonderful place Miranda July's brain is. I think we are so lucky she is able to share pieces of it with us. I am a fan of July's other work as well, and her latest movie Kajillionaire is probably my favorite of her films so far. Some of the characters' names alone are hilarious. I was able to catch a screening of it at Sundance.Kajillionaire tells the story of a girl and her parents who need to hustle and con people just to get by. Her parents are very odd and jaded by their past lives and the people and government who took part in them. She has grown up in this life of getting by just based on what she is able to steal or find to sell for money. She has learned to mistrust others, and she has never seen her parents showing anyone preference or affection--even her. She is curious about being held, but that makes her feel weak and ashamed. To me, Kajillionaire is one of those movies that made me feel alive. Learning how to love and be loved in return is just beautiful. I found myself laughing out loud one minute, and the next minute I felt quiet or sad. You will be grateful of every good thing you have in your life; not everyone is as fortunate to have a place to live that doesn't leak or even simply someone to hug them."
"1945","Kajillionaire",9,"Magnificent movie. Just when you think you've settled into it's bizarre humanity, it turns into a hearbreaking exploration","Unusual, revealing, funny in an enlightening way. A must see for young women especially."
"1946","Joker",10,"As a viewer that actually went to TIFF and witnessed this film and didn't want to believe the hype, it is an absolute MASTERPIECE and Phoenix is a certified legend.","I was a person that saw all the hype and claims of masterpiece as overreacting and overblown excitement for another Joker based film. I thought this looked solid at best and even a bit too pretentious in the trailer, but in here to say I was incredibly wrong. This is a massive achievement of cinema that's extremely rare in a day and age of cgi nonsense and reboots. While this is somewhat of a reboot of sorts, the standalone origin tale is impeccable from start to finish and echoes resemblance to the best joker origin comics from the past. Joaquin bleeds, sweats, and cries his every drop into this magnificently dedicated performance. Heath Ledger would be proud. This is undoubtedly the greatest acting performance since Heath's joker. The directing and writing is slickly brilliant and the bleak settings and tones are palpable throughout. When this film was over the place was blown away and every audience member was awestruck that they witnessed a film that could still transport them into a character's world and very existence. Believe the hype. This is going to be revered as a transcending masterpiece of cinema."
"1947","Joker",10,"Outstanding movie with a haunting performance and best character development ever seen","Every once in a while a movie comes, that truly makes an impact. Joaquin's performance and scenography in all it's brilliance. Grotesque, haunting and cringy. Hard to watch at times,... but so mesmerizing, you won't blink an eye watching it. Tragic, but with seriously funny moments. Emotional rollercoaster - sometimes, with multiple emotions popping-up at the same time.this is far from a typical action-riddled predictable super-hero movie - it's a proper psychological thriller/drama, with the single best character development I have ever seen."
"1948","Joker",10,"Only certain people can relate","This is a movie that only those who have felt alone and isolated can truly relate to it. You understand the motive and you feel sorry for the character. A lot of people will see this movie and think that it encourages violence. But truly, this movie should encourage each and every one of us to become a better person, treat everyone with respect and make each other feel like they belong in this world, instead of making them feel isolated."
"1949","Joker",10,"Perfect in every aspect.","Truly a masterpiece, The Best Hollywood film of 2019, one of the Best films of the decade... And truly the Best film to bring a comic book so chillingly and realistically to real ife.
Remarkable Direction, Cinematography, Music and the Acting.
Some people are surprised to find it DISTURBING and VIOLENT, but it's a necessity and message.
It's about society and reflects those underappreciated/unrecognized/bullied people, proving they can do something too.
The way it shows class difference, corruption and how rich and talented rule others around them is not exaggerated and that's what makes it different.
It's BELIEVABLE.
There could be multiple JOKERs living in our society that could shake those around them in much bitter way than the film shows making people uncomforting people.
Consider this a wake up call, a message, but first a film. A PERFECT film."
"1950","Joker",10,"MASTERPIECE <U+0001F60D>","Joaquin Phoenix gives a tour de force performance, fearless and stunning in its emotional depth and physicality. It's impossible to talk about this without referencing Heath Ledger's Oscar-winning performance from The Dark Knight, widely considered the definitive live-action portrayal of the Joker, so let's talk about it. The fact is, everyone is going to be stunned by what Phoenix accomplishes, because it's what many thought impossible - a portrayal that matches and potentially exceeds that of The Dark Knight's Clown Prince of Crime"
"1951","Joker",10,"The Hype is real","Most of the time movies are anticipated like this they end up falling short, way short. Joker is the first time I was more than happy with the hype. Please ignore the complaints of ""pernicious violence"" as they are embarrassing to say the least. We haven't seen a comic movie this real before. If we ever ""deserved"" a better class of criminal - Phillips and Phoenix have delivered. This is dark, Joker IS dark and you will fall in love with the villain as you should. The bad guys are always more romantic anyway."
"1952","Joker",10,"JUST AMAZING. How does this movie exist.","Let me start off by saying if Joaquin Phoneix doesn't get his Oscar for this movie. Then the Oscars should be cancelled. Phoneix is amazing as you might've heard from every review ever! But Todd Phillips. Is at his best here. The story lines he takes and visuals are just breathtaking. The score!! Omg the Score! Every time that score came on, I felt very uncomfortable, like something horrible was about to happen. It was GREAT. The Inspirations from Taxi Driver and King of Comedy are there, and add so much for the movie. And I got to be honest. There are scenes that are very violent. And its disturbing. But I honestly expected it to be WAYYYY more violent from all the controversy going on. Overall this movie was GREAT. Come Oscar season, it needs to be nominated for Best Picture, ScreenPlay, Cinematography, Actor, Score and Director"
"1953","Joker",10,"Went for a second time to watch","I get why some people hate this . It's because of the political message and how some people think that you need get empathy for Arthur's madness. But come on that is not the point and it will never be. Enjoy this masterpiece because Joaquin Phoenix and Todd Phillips overdid themselves with this movie . The acting,music and cinematography are just amazing ! Please enjoy the movie without overthinking it."
"1954","Joker",10,"A psychological study, rather than a superhero flick","I have seen Joker yesterday at Venice an early ill-fated screening. We had some trouble with audio that lead to a near-hour delay, but it definitely was worth it.Joker deserved to be presented at Venice Film Festival, an event that regards cinema as a form of art, because this film is far from a blockbuster or a mere entertainer movie, as most films in the genre are.It focuses on the psyche of the main character, as it slowly crumbles under the pressure of society. And thus, Joaquin Phoenix does a wonderful performance, earning almost surely a nomination at the oscars at least.
It's a take on the Joker that differs from Ledger's, but I'd say that both are equally as good. The main difference might be that Ledger's joker is a rational that acts insane, while Phoenix's is insane to the root.Despite being a movie about a superhero villain, Joker is much superior to most of the movies of the genre (I'd exclude the Dark Knight Trilogy only, but Joker is easily as good as Nolan's movies, or at least very close). It is a small-scaled film, with a distinct style and cinematography (that cannot but be appreciated) and a set of very cinephile references that however do not feel too forced or overly opressive. (most notable are the similarities to Scorsese's 'Taxi Driver' and his 'The King of Comedy', but also Chaplin's 'Modern Times' is somewhat referenced).I am eager to see more non-comedic efforts by Todd Phillips. This movie was so far probably the best of 2019 (at worst contested so far only by Dolor Y Gloria or Once Upon a Time in Hollywood), and that should be very convincing."
"1955","Joker",10,"Joaquin 'OSCAR', Joker = best Dark suspense thriller ... Darker than dark Knight.","It's sad that Joaquin missed Oscar for 'The gladiator' as he was very compelling Villain. But I am quite confident he will win it for the 'Joker'. Damn what a movie !!! Keeps u on the toes all the time. Unpredictable storyline and really a deep interesting plot. Did I forget to mention acting ? Damn Do niro and Joaquin teach u what really is 5 star acting.
To enjoy this movie, get a wine in your hand, close the curtains, turn of ur cellphones and put do not disturb sign on ur door. Best Dark thriller suspense movie you will get to experience."
"1956","Joker",10,"Finally, a REAL movie","This movie causes the audience to consider many topics on morality, particularly the poor choices made by the Joker. The Joker is more relatable in this movie than antagonists usually are. I think this gives a more realistic view of ""bad"" people, who are not usually 100% bad in all ways as society often judges. It is important to know when to sympathize with the Joker (towards the beginning of the movie), and when he needs to be identified as a threat (when he begins making certain bad choices). This movie is only suitable for adults who are willing to pick it apart and think critically about it. It isn't for light amusement. That substance is what makes it so good.If you aren't able to ponder underlying themes on your own, and you have to be handed all your thoughts to you, then this isn't the best movie for you."
"1957","Joker",9,"Not a spoon feeding of CGI fueled faux drama.","The movie affects you in a way that makes it physically painful to experience, but in a good way."
"1958","Joker",10,"Good lord","The acting, cinematography, sound design, and the script itself is phenomenal. This movie is a triumph. Joaquin Pheonix deserves an Oscar win for this tbh."
"1959","Joker",10,"Joker > Endgame","Need I say more? Everything about this Movie is Masterful in every single way! Joker isn't just an awesome comic book movie, it's an awesome movie, period. It offers no easy answers to the unsettling questions it raises about a cruel society in decline. Joaquin Phoenix's fully committed performance and Todd Phillips' masterful albeit loose reinvention of the DC source material make Joker a film that should leave comic book fans and non-fans alike disturbed and moved in all the right ways."
"1960","Joker",10,"Oscar for Phoenix","I will stop watching movies if Joaquin Phoenix is not awarded Oscar for his tremendous acting."
"1961","Joker",10,"Critics are useless!","I quit relying on critic reviews years ago... I noticed for this movie that the critics ratings were low but viewer ratings were high. That being said, what is the point of a critic when for this movie, they are oh so wrong.
I went and saw this tonite with my mom. I went in skeptical and w some what low expectations. I knew not to expect your typical super hero movie.
What we got was a masterpiece. I went in expecting sheer boredom and I was instead on the edge of my seat the whole time. Not action edge of your seat, it was a fear of what he may do or say next edge of your seat. To see this character evolve into what we all know as the #1 villain of Batman was beyond genius and Joaquin Phoenix is a true master at perfecting the art of consuming himself into this character. I may be all over the place with this but I don't care. This movie, the story, the acting, directing, effects, everyone brought their A game and JP definitely deserves a nod and win for this role. And no, there is no comparison here to Jack Nicholson or Heath Ledger. Each actor took on this character and different levels, different story points and different points in time, so any comparison would just not be feasible or fair to any of the actors as they embraced him and made him come to life in their own genius way!"
"1962","Joker",6,"Extremely overrated","I went into this film expecting an all-time classic based on the reviews I had read & what I ended up watching was just a decent film overall. Phoenix is outstanding...so he definitely did his part. But I feel like if you've seen the trailers you've seen the movie because the best way I can describe this film is it feels like a 2 hour version of the trailer. At 2 hours it's a relatively common runtime, but it felt a lot longer...which isn't good. I'd say this is much more of a rental than a theater movie. Kinda just....eh."
"1963","Joker",7,"Between a 7 and an 8","I thought this film was good but I just don't get the hype personally. The acting was amazing and the film was good overall but I think 'masterpiece' and 'film of the year' are a bit overused throughout the reviews. In no way did I dislike this film, I thought it was really good, just overhyped. I feel as though a lot of the 10/10 reviews are purely based on the fact that it already has amazing reviews and so people want to carry the praise further and that it is about the joker. If this film was released and was about some random guy in the same situation, I don't think the reviews would be as high but maybe that's the point."
"1964","Joker",7,"OK film","Do not really understand all the tens here. Sure, a good movie, good acting, nice shooting. But the plot is not so intriguing. At times it is really long and somewhat boring. I needed to double-check the genre to see if this is a drama or what. Crime, drama, thriller it said. I would put it maybe 90% in the drama and rest in thriller.I miss more dialogue, more depth, more substance. The plot is really not more then a somewhat crazy person becoming a bit crazier. Sure there is an undertone in that it is society and the system and the mean character of people that is bringing him down and creating the evil beast which later wants to destroy everything. Absolutely, but I think it is not intriguing story and plot and dialogue enough to give this a ten.Worthy of watching, yes. But not amazing"
"1965","Joker",9,"Don't (forget to) smile.","Joker is directed by Todd Philips and stars Joaquin Phoenix as Arthur Fleck, a man disregarded and thrown out of society.We live in an era in which formulaic comic book movies are more and more common. Joker not only proves that you can make a comic book movie without a villain but also proves that comic book movies can be used as psychological studies reflecting on how our society views and treats mental health issues of certain individuals.If I had to describe Joaquin Phoenix as the Joker in one word it would be mesmerising. His take on the iconic comic book character is filled with emotional depth to the point where it's almost painful to watch and flawlessly realistic making it one of the best performances of the decade.The cinematography is also something to note. It is full of gorgeous shots with a beautiful colour palette making it's shot composition and structure heavily differ from most comic book films.The score is very minimalistic but every time it comes on it feels unsettling and haunting which adds to the suspense of the story.My biggest and only issue with Joker is that it's too inspired by Scorsese's King of Comedy and Taxi Driver making the majority of the film predictable. However, making it predictable didn't take away much from its quality and only made it more unsettling because we can see the degradation of Joker's mind before it happens making this film more depressing.I wouldn't really call Joker a comic book movie. Yes, it's based on a comic book and depicts arguably the most iconic comic book character of all time, but it stands alone among dozens of its predecessors as a psychological drama that reflects on society and its issues rather than a fantasy world.Overall, Joker is a brilliant take on the character, however, it's not for the faint of heart or narrow-minded and prejudiced people.Final Grade - 9/10"
"1966","Joker",7,"Is it great? I don't know.","When I heard everyone saying that this is the film of the year and all the reviews flooding in with 10's, I was quite hyped and excited for this movie. When I walked out of the cinema, I felt hollow and empty.Before I continue writing, let me say this, This is NOT the film of the year nor is it a real masterpiece. The cinematography is excellent and the acting is incredible, that's just it. The side-characters are bland and overly dramatic. The plot heavily relies on plot-twists and the film is so harsh that it actually falls flat on it's face.Are there no good points though? Phoenix is phenomenal and the score is great. The cinematography is also incredible but the plot is not that great at all. It even has plot holes and scenes that left me empty.Film of the year? Nope."
"1967","Joker",10,"BELIEVE THE HYPE","Joaquin Phoenix gives Heath Ledger a run for his money, true story. This is not a popcorn fluff comic book flick. DO NOT TAKE YOUR KIDS TO SEE THIS MOVIE. Shut down all ballots for the Oscar, Joaquin is taking that one home hands down. One of the best origin stories EVER put out. The only downside to this movie, is that it is a stand alone film that will have no sequels or ties to the DC Universe. Todd Philips take on the Joker is one of pure brilliance and Joaquin Phoenix was the Joker we deserved. He didn't steal from Jack or Heath but yet you got a taste of both."
"1968","Joker",NA,"Yikes. THIS is people's ""best movie ever""?","The recurring themes of so many of the 10 star reviews here should tell you a lot about this movie and its audience. If you can't get through a movie review without tossing in one or more claims that ""THIS movie is so much better and smarter than YOUR superhero movie"" (or even basing your entire review around this premise), then I hate to break it to you, but kid, you're nowhere near as intelligent and grown up as you think you are. This ""my comic publisher is better than yours"" BS should have been left behind on your grade school playground, it has absolutely no relevance to the quality of this movie, and your opinion of this movie should be considered highly suspect if you're in this group.I gotta say, if this movie was also your idea of the most perfect film ever made, you really need to get out more. Look, I get it. If you live in a safe little box where all you watch are superhero movies and mainstream blockbusters then I understand how exposure to themes like this for the first time would seem new and exciting to you, and I think we can all agree that this is probably the best DC Comics related movie in the last decade or so (though that's not a high bar to meet) and of course Joaquin Phoenix is a very talented actor, but stop and take a step back and look at this thing.Joker does indeed present a theme that is of importance to our society, that of the neglect and demonizing of the mentally ill to a degree that sometimes creates monsters which everyone around them should have seen coming a mile away if they hadn't been too busy looking away to avoid feeling uncomfortable. Unfortunately, reminding us all of the fact that this situation still exists is all this movie really has to say. It dances around important subjects like ""HEY KIDS, CLASS INEQUALITY!"", but then never offers any actual insight into them, usually because it's too busy making forced Batman references or dropping cringey little edgy moments like the ""Don't smile"" sign scene which seem to have been designed solely to have something for Hot Topic to print a new t-shirt of. Between that and every single plot twist being telegraphed so very far in advance because a lot of us have seen all these exact same twists so very many times before, I just wasn't impressed.Perhaps if this had been an actual stand-alone movie of its own instead of being shackled by its completely unnecessary ties to the Batman universe it could have done something more interesting with its themes. Don't get me wrong, I don't have any problem with superhero movies, but it just feels so gratuitous here, as if someone came up with this idea, pitched it to an executive, and was told ""sounds great, but can you make it a Batman movie somehow?"", and I'm sorry, but I'm just not into a movie trying to tell me a half-hearted, yet dead-serious speech about mental illness in modern society while simultaneously constantly reminding me that it's technically a superhero movie because $$$"
"1969","Joker",10,"Masterpiece.","The music. The intense. The realism. The performance. The story. Such a perfect combination of everything. I never felt that a character like joker could be real until I saw this. Phoenix shows us what a joker is in our society and shows us how power can be obtained. Philips on the other hand had the perfect choice of music, camera angles, lighting and every important factor. Overall, I did not expect the story to be this perfect. Too many shocking turns happened and it really does represent today's society. If I was in the first screening, I would have applauded for 80 min not 8."
"1970","Joker",6,"OMG - Am I getting old or are people getting more stupid","I was so hyped up to see this movie, loved the trailer, only movie I have wanted to watch in the cinema for a very long time.I watched it and was bored. the astectics were amazing, music was good, story and execution was meh. the performence of the joker was a good performence but people raving about this are driving me mad. either you have not seen many movies or I have seen too many. this movie was bang average and was actually boring. I was thinking about leaving half way through as I was bored out of my mind.I do not regret watching it but it is being so overhyped that I am so confused right now. I think it had a good premise but could have been so much more, so much more.Signs of a great movie is the repeat viewing of it or it moving you, did not move me whatsoever and I would not watch it again.I thought maybe people are getting paid to write good review but have actually met people who think it is the best movie ever.... OMGGGThis movie is bang average and way overhyped.
phenoix performence is good but as the story and execution is so bad, I feel he never even touched the higher spectrums of performence.I have experienced and seen worse in my life, if this made you feel, you are (i hate this word but have to use it) a snowflake.

"1971","Joker",3,"Miserable and Unpleasant Slog of a Movie about Nothing","BREAKING NEWS: Killer clowns are back! But this time they're not pranksters mimicking Pennywise to scare the sh*t out of people for viral memes; they're ""incels"" threatening to gun down everyone who chooses to take their date to this dour, depressing, demented movie.If this Joker were the one featured in Nolan's marvelously entertaining Dark Knight, I doubt any of your skinny lonely drugged-up psychos would be rushing to hail this guy as his hero and inspiration.Ledger's Joker is brilliant, manipulaitve, and consumed with an infectious, and sometimes charming, confidence. Phoenix's Joker is dumb, depressing, and insecure. Ledger makes things happen. Things happen to Phoenix. The Joker controls events in Dark Knight. Events spiral out of control in Joker.There is no fun in this movie, no great action set pieces, no hint of hope or optimism. It's a two hour slog of watching a miserable man drive himself insane until he starts murdering people. Then seemingly everyone goes insane because ""they've had enough!""Change the name of this movie to Arthur, eliminate the very few references to the Batman universe, and I doubt you'd think this was an origin story to the Joker we all know and love. Maybe this Joker is the closest to what the Joker would resemble in the real world...which is perhaps why this movie is so awful. Who wants that movie?There are plenty of good character-driven films of mentally disturbed individuals who spiral out of control. There are plenty of good dark gritty super hero movies. This is neither of them."

"1973","Joker",2,"Beware of anyone who hails this as ""a masterpiece"".","Simply put, this movie is no masterpiece and if you think it is, you need to see WAY more movies. And by way more movies, I mean movies that aren't superhero movies. The funny thing about all the people who call this movie ""a masterpiece"" is that they can't qualify that claim in any way. Try it for yourself - ask the next person you talk to about Joker why it's a masterpiece. If you're lucky, you might get a response that goes as deep as them saying something vague about the writing and directing being amazing. Ask them to explain that. I guarantee you they won't be able to. This movie is one note, from beginning to end. Joker is crazy at the start, and crazy at the end. There is zero nuance, subtlety or character development. He simply goes from being crazy to crazier. It is cynical, lazy and a dull retread of the REAL masterpieces (like Taxi Driver and King of Comedy) from which it shamelessly steals (poorly, I might add). Beware of anyone who calls this a masterpiece, they have zero understanding of cinema."
"1974","Joker",10,"Brilliant. And best joker I've ever seen","Phoenix convinces me that he has always meant to be the joker. The movie went beyond my expectations, so many emotions went through me these couple hours. I think because its rated R, Phoenix was able to unlock jokers full psychotic potential as the character he is meant to be. This was an AMAZING story, and it calls for more. And I mean a build up, a second movie, maybe one with batman? My hopes are too high at this point, but nevertheless, brilliant goddamn movie and THE BEST joker ever played hands down."
"1975","Joker",10,"Movie of the Decade","The pool does not need the money. They need the dignity and respect, coz that is what it takes to be a human. If you don't have that, money will only be a reminder of them being a ""good boy"". Like some politicians, they feel so frustrated when people from the lower class does not accept their funding champions. In this movie, through joker's life, I begin to get it."
"1976","Joker",10,"CLOWN PRINCE OF CRIME has arrived","10/10 Amazing story, Brilliant taking, magnificent cinematography.
Someone had to step out of the safe game played by Superhero movies and Joker movie does just that (also The Boys). Movie is gritty, real, insanely dark and sometime quite disturbing to people who don't want accept what's shown in the movie is a terrible reality we face everyday if refused a proper care.
Normally people start to compare the movie with one of the greatest like The Dark Knight and in acting wise to that of Heath ledger's Potrayal of joker.
I wouldn't say this movie is better that that or otherwise , but it will stand tall amongst the greatest like The Godfather, Taxi Driver, Citizen Kane, The Dark Knight.
Coming to the inevitable comparison of who's the better Joker? Heath or Joaquin. The answer is Both did a phenomenal job and the Joker character itself is fortunate to have being played by two greatest actors.
Definitely a top contender for Oscars. I personally think it would take away
1.Best Actor 2.Cinematography 3.Original score and if Once Upon a time in Hollywood loses in Make-up and hairstyling category it would definitely be to The Joker."
"1977","Joker",1,"I feel like everyone is brain washed","I thought this movie was complete and utter garbage. I don't understand why people liked this movie so much. The character doesn't even stay true to the comics and the director flat out said it didn't, and then they made it seem like it was part of Gothams fall and he was just a little boy that had a laughing problem... Hated it"
"1978","Joker",1,"I don't get it","Yes Joaquin's performance is good and the cinematography is pretty but otherwise I do not get all the hype about this movie.Not for a long time have I felt like I would be better off leaving the cinema than staying and getting my money's worth.For something that was supposed to be gritty and real it had a lot of convenient scenes to help push the plot along.Very disappointed."
"1979","Joker",10,"The Rise of the Joker!","Joaquin' portrayal of a sociopathic, mentally unstable man's transformation to the iconic Joker was non other than a grippingly accurate, realistic and touching rendition. A dark and disturbing character piece led by an Oscar worthy performance by Joaquin Phoenix. You really do feel bad for this guy, which makes it all the more heartbreaking when he inevitably becomes the clown prince of crime we all know and love, although we've never seen him like this. We see him suffer throughout the movie to the point we're almost rooting for himk to become a mass murdering psyco clown, because that at least will make feel better; then it happens and we just wish this could have all just been avoided, because es so messed up. We feel for him and care about him. By the time he's the joker, we wish we could've helped him. There's a lot of great nods to the greater Batman universe, yet the movie is a self contained character piece. That can only be the mark of a great movie. All the acting is great, the plot (while similar to Taxi Driver) is brilliant and the quality of the movie shows you don't need CGI super powers to be a great villain in a Superhero movie. Is a joke not everyone gets. This movie is ""the rise of the Joker!"" 10/10"
"1980","Joker",3,"I made an account just to rate my disappoint for this film.","I was expecting a masterpiece and oscar worthy film from all the hype.
I actually didn't enjoy watching this movie.
there was no message, it was slow and the joker turned out just to be the son of a schizophrenic and went crazy over a slight amount of bullying. I don't see how anyone could relate to this character and the laughing is lame acting way overdone.
I'm just stunned that this has a 9/10 rating right now, how the hell?"
"1981","Joker",10,"Stunning","One of the best movies in these few years and 100% Oscar worthy
Joaquin Phoenix delivers one of the best performances I've ever scene"
"1982","Joker",NA,"A Represintation of a Real Life Joker.","This movie answers this question...what will the Joker be if he was a real life character ? A great deep and moving story, a life journey of a man who's suffering from some psychological issues and how neglect, bullying and rudeness by other human being can push a man to complete madness.Although it's not accurate to any comic book adaptation or any TV series or movie before it, yet it's a fresh and unique take on the character of the clown prince of crime from a realistic approach and I believe with Joaquin Phoenix amazing performance as the Joker in which he managed to bring a real life look-alike early version of the Joker which although is not comic book accurate but I feel it's a very decent foundation for Joker 2 which should be more true to heart of the original version of our lovable villain.The movie is over all a great piece of filmmaking in all of its aspects. From the plot which was very interesting, believable and many can relate to it, through the acting which was impressively splendid to the directing which was outstanding. My main take on the movie is the lack of any positive lead character, I know we live in a tough world which full of negativity but there are some positive examples here and there and to shed some light on one or two characters in this movie would've been a nice positive thought.The Joker movie can be misunderstood by many thinking it'll inspire crime and violence but I believe on the contrary that many who go through hard life will feel sympathy for the Joker character, others will even relate to his misery and may justify his actions. I believe the movie is meant to be a wake up call for many! A lot of people daily suffer from bullying, racism, hate crimes or neglect and sometimes they go through worse, we should take a deeper look at our actions and know that - aside from money and authority - we are all equally humans, we should treat one another the same way we expect to be treated."
"1983","Joker",10,"Saw it tonight and had to make an account so I can tell everyone how good it is","Seriously, unbelievable. Dare I say better than Heath Ledger? If Joaquin Phoenix doesn't win the Oscar for best actor and 'Joker' doesn't win at the VERY least, best screenplay, it will be one of the biggest Oscar snubs of our time"
"1984","Joker",10,"Anyone who rates this movie poorly clearly doesn't appreciate cinema","While the trailers for this movie have may seemed like there was potential for an action packed movie, this movie, clearly before it came to theaters was intended to be a progressive character study. You shouldn't go into this movie expecting intense action or the joker we know of the past. This is a movie about how Arthur Fleck becomes the Joker.I have seen so many bad reviews about how boring or slow the movie is, but I believe it was utter perfection. The first part of the movie we begin to understand Arthur as a person. All of his interactions with everyone in his life, be it good or bad. The whole point of a character study is evolution. And this is far and away one of the greatest evolutions of a character I have ever seen in a movie.Joaquin Phoenix's performance is by far the best acting I have seen in a movie possibly in the last few decades. We see a challenged person be challenged by society and it completely breaks him down over time. And Joaquin isn't acting, he is evolving all throughout the movie. If anyone thinks he doesn't put on an Oscar winning performance, they're out of their effing mind. Yes, the movie is slow to start, but it has to be. We couldn't just jump into the joker and all the chaos. We need to know where it came from to begin with.The whole compilation of the movie is amazing. The complete Oscar deserving performance of Joaquin, the choreography, the cinematography, the score. Everything is in perfect harmony. While there may have been a lot of controversy surrounding this movie, the team put together a perfect movie and I pity those who can't appreciate the tears and sweat and emotion that went into making this movie.I have always been so one sided in my movie preferences between Marvel and DC. I feel like Marvel is sooo much better overall and most movies DC puts out are trash. But Joker is far and away my favorite comic movie. Even though it takes a completely different spin on comic movies. You have to appreciate the evolution to appreciate this movie. It's not an action movie, but it's really rips and tears at all the emotions in one movie while adding a wild suspenseful kick. No other comic book movie has done that before."
"1985","Joker",1,"So overrated/overhyped","Don't waste 2 hours of your life this movie is the baddest i've seen in a long time. Crappy writing and no good storyline...it was boring.

"1986","Joker",1,"Who's the real joker?","I don't understand the high ratings. I went to the cinema with high expectations, only to discover that the movie was slow as anything and was almost finished before the first killing happened. It was a dreadful time having to wait for something to happen.
But yes, once the movie was finished and I finally walked out, I got the cosmic joke; I was the joker, trusting the reviews and leaving disappointed in disbelief I actually paid for watching it."
"1987","Joker",10,"Astonishing Masterpiece","What an incredible ride this was. I was almost motionless throughout, watching in awe the performance of a lifetime - the transition from troubled man to monster, the hounding score which directly drove the goosebumps, the cinematography which made you feel like you were flying through Gotham looking for Arthur yourself and the masterful De Niro who gave his nod to Jerry Lewis. Ignore DC. Ignore Batman. This is a work of art in its own right."
"1988","Joker",1,"2 hours full of bad , bad mood.","Joaquín Phoenix's unconvincing laughing, and looking like a beaten dog had brutaly ennoyed me after 5 minutes.

More of this stupid excess of brutality in the name of... what?
Yes. It is the same director as in the hangover 3.
I don't want to be a partir of this.
Brutal and boring."
"1989","Joker",1,"Joke's on You","This film is about mental illness. Specifically, a mental illness called creative diarrhoea. In the film, a band of Hollywood's most insipid producers, writers, directors and other such riffraff suffering from this ailment got together for a group therapy session, in which the therapist, a Hollywood mogul, had them 'let it all out', gathered the refuse and flogged it off for a few hundred million dollars.Seriously though, there is sooo much wrong with this movie. I won't even start with how I knew that a Joker sob story had no hope of (artistic) success, nor with why I went I went to see it anyway. I'll start by pointing out other reviewers' observation that this is not even the Joker. He's not suave, he's not witty, there are no lethal gimmicks, no morbid jokes, no anarchism, and he isn't a criminal mastermind. He's just a loser that goes off on a school shooter streak.Secondly, this is not, as I said earlier, a film about mental illness. It is a mockery of it, cashing in on the increasing awareness about mental health. There is not one concept about psychosis or other mental health problems judiciously explored in the movie (an illness which causes the sufferer to laugh in inappropriate situations? Seriously?!). All you're getting here is a downtrodden loner being subjected to beatings and injustices designed to spark indignation in the viewer, then going off on a murder spree.With regards to the much-praised acting, it's a mystery to me how anyone could have come to a judgement of Phoenix's theatrical achievement based off such an asinine script, because I can't. Not that you should devote an iota of attention to any of these positive reviews, because I'm fairly confident that there is some large-scale review rigging going on.The plot is one dimensional and juvenile, the dialogue as engaging as a monotone nursery rhyme and the character development shallow. There were goofs left right and centre, like revolvers with zero recoil and 8 bullets. Why did Arthur keep dancing? Why did we need to see Arthur fondling himself? Why is he so emaciated? Why so much smoking? I watched so many close-ups of cigarettes burn out it makes me wonder if the film was sponsored by the tobacco industry.The two positives in the movie for me were firstly, the final talk show scene, littered though it was with imperfections like the rest of the movie, which did have me sitting a little less slouched in my seat. Also, there were some interesting theories presented tying the Joker with the Batman.With the bar set so high by The Dark Knight, no director seeking artistic acclaim will go near the Joker for many years to come, maybe ever, but on the other hand, the Joker character has been rendered a boon for Hollywood opportunists, and this is the second time we've seen the character butchered in a low effort high budget money maker. This one will be forgotten quick, but I don't know how long it will be before the Joker himself recovers."
"1990","Joker",1,"just a joke,the movie.","I'm keeping it short, the movie sucks.Yes, I know there's a need to build character and crap, and I think it's important for any good movie.Same goes with this, I get it Joker was a troubled man, I get his frustration, but I don't need 2 hours of the movie telling me the same crap over and over again.Give the guy an Oscar for performance but throw this movie into the trash right after."

A beautiful presentation of storyline , direction , screenplay was all at its peak of greatness ... Heath ledger smiling down to earth :)"
"1993","Joker",7,"Kind of a letdown....","The reviews here are making this film out to be far better than it actually is. Don't get me wrong, technically, it is extremely well done and Phoenix's performance is really quite extraordinary (he is definitely looking at an Oscar nomination), but despite excellent writing, acting and direction........the film is kinda boring.It had its moments, and, sure, it has some very disturbing elements but....If I had a watch, I would have looked at it many times as what this film lacks is...excitement.The final act is most excellent, but it felt like it took forever to get to it."

Do yourself a favor and watch it!And remember to be good to one another. You dont know what someone else is going through."
"1995","Joker",9,"Joker's laughter is no joking matter","Writer-director Todd Phillips's new movie ""Joker"" appeals to me on multiple levels, primarily by offering an engaging story, strongly rooted in believable reality, related to audiences mainly by opposing protagonist's prevalent dark depressive moods while using often optimistic soundtrack and sound editing, shallow nonetheless rich visuals, angles and framing, theatricality augmented through expressive costumes, props and sets, but most impressively via great principal performances and acting choices made by Joaquin Phoenix in the lead as a title character (under proper fictional name Arthur Fleck), whose sudden uncontrollable and seemingly inappropriate laughter (justified as a medical condition) easily counterpoints the (painful need for) outcry from Gotham (read: any) City masses, hurt and deprived by injustices of their quotidian existence, as well as by Robert De Niro in a quintessential supporting role of a TV-comedy show host Murray Franklin (both worthy of the end-of-the-year acting award considerations), and by setting believable pre-course for the future adventures of the most realistic DC Comics character, the Batman (not a superhero at all, with his extraordinary capabilities rather resulting from his physical fitness and skills combined with high technology employed), who appears here only as a young boy, and whose later adult activities could be understood as largely driven by what has happened to his parents in the final scene of this movie, an event directly inspired by actions of Joker, henceforth his future main nemeses."

More to the boring side.It lacks plot twist and focus too much on character development. How many times someone needs to get punched in the face before they go crazy?He suffers, gets fired, has a mental illness, nobody loves him, he's sad and he cries and he laughs and he laughs again.

"1999","Joker",10,"Best DC movie since The Dark Knight Rises","DC can STILL give us a compelling movie. Wasn't quite hyped about it, I mean, an origin story of a villain made by the director of Hangover movies; what could I even expect? Then, the reviews started to drop. Still wasn't sure if I would like it. And after I saw it, it was way better than I thought it would be. I won't call it a masterpiece, but it definitely is on my top 3 DC films of all times!Good : There's hardly anything bad about Joker. Joaquin Phoenix does a great job of bringing the character into life. Rather than a typical superhero/supervillain origin story, we get to see a psychological drama + horror, and thank God, we got that. I love the genre, I love films like Infinity War, Days of Future Past, Endgame and Raimi's Spider-Man. But occasionally, it's really good to take a break from such films. It's, kind of, in the category of films like Unbreakable. Basically, the movie is (no spoilers ahead) Arthur, being tormented by the society and being a mentally unstable loner, loses his mind after the constant torment and after that, all hell breaks loose. That's all the movie shows. It would be quite difficult to give a really good story for a plot like this, since there are many movies with this kind of plot (awfully crappy ones included). I completely liked this movie, means the screenplay and direction worked for me. You can feel for Arthur, whenever the movie asks you to. You want to root for Arthur, but you know that it will mean some incredibly terrible things will happen. We see him slowly transition into Joker, and when he completely turns into the Joker it is worth a round of applause. We feel good as well as terrified with the actions of the Joker whenever he snaps and crazy stuff happens. Without getting into spoilers, I would say - in short - that it has many quotable lines and each of them make sense. Whatever Joker (a psychopath) says is more realistic than what a sane person says. And obviously has some sick, terrifying and gruesome Joker moments that a proper Joker movie should have. If it's not clear by the trailers, there's no Batman here. But (again, no spoilers) it does have some Batman references to support the movie. It could've created a mess and might have felt like a shoehorned plotline, but it plays out as a proper support for the main story and the transition of Arthur into Joker.Mixed : It is a good thing that the movie has a 70s psycho horror vibe to it. But, it could've been more original. Like many others have pointed out, it's similar to Taxi Driver by Scorsese. While it wasn't a copy and paste of Taxi Driver, but some parts make it obvious that the movie was inspired by Taxi Driver. Not necessarily a bad thing, the movie has the elements as a homage-ish way, but looking at how well made it was, it could've been slightly more original. And, it may feel a bit slow for some people, though it's worth your time.My take on the controversy : It can happen that some morons might watch this film and cause violence. It can happen with any violent movie. But, even though it justified the Joker's actions, it doesn't show them to be right. Speaking of violence, it's just psychologically compelling horror. It's less violent than Deadpool, but feels more violent as it's a serious movie. So, glorification and siding with a psychopath is a complete and total nonsense.Conclusion : It's a must watch. You don't need to follow any of the DC movies to understand it. But do not expect it to be a typical superhero action film with CGI battles and a spectacle. Wrong expectations might ruin the experience. Else, I found it to be better than The Dark Knight Rises. And TDKR is one of my favorites in the genre. If a Nolan movie is replaced by another movie in my list, you may consider it to be great. One last thing, people causing violence because of Joker would be equivalent to The Good, The Bad and The Ugly inspiring three people to have a gun duel for some gold.Rating:Score : 10/10Grade : A+"

There is no action, no substance, no humor. Everything is so cringe and overacted.
I suppose if you like those independent movies at TIFF or Cannes this is something for you. If you actually wanna be entertained and see The Joker from the DC, this is not it.
Best description is millennial joker. Society is mean to him, nobody gives him anything so he cries and complains about it to get attention. When none is given, he starts killing."

Very dark, grimy and disturbing, exactly how an origin film about the joker should be. I have no doubt it will win multiple oscars. Do yourself a favor and go see it!!!"
"2005","Joker",3,"Overrated and badly directed film with a misleading title","Joker is basically the lite edition or postmodern version of Fight Club or the Scorsese films it lifts from. It's interesting to see how easily words like masterpiece and groundbreaking are being used for this, and that is the one joke that this movie successfully pulls off. It's just a whole lot of self-seriousness and posturing and is essentially hollow. It pretends to say a lot but ends up saying very little or nothing at all, not about the character nor about the society he's part of.It is also 'Joker' only in name and has very little to do with the super-villain. I'm all for a different interpretation and even an origin story for the joker but this movie fails to recognise or capture his spirit. Even 'Proto-Joker' doesn't quite do it justice, and I can think of a dozen more suitable titles e.g. Arthur, The Untalented Mr. Fleck, Smoker, Poser etc. Infact he's more akin to a less dangerous but also mentally unstable villain like Ratcatcher or Calendar Man though just with a clown theme, and is not even close to embodying the joker's extreme form of nihilism. It's not that it has to be a comic-book accurate portrayal, that would be irrelevant if it was genuinely a good movie. But far from being a masterpiece , it doesn't quite manage even that. It fails not just as an inaccurate portrayal of the Joker's spirit or essence, but also as a film about a person going over the edge.The weakest aspect of the movie for me is the poor to average direction. The movie lacks any of the subtlety and nuance that I was hoping for and what unfolds is not as much character development as it is things happening to Arthur. A good example of the poor writing and direction is the very Trump-like and one-dimensional Thomas Wayne character. This first became obvious during a scene in which some people happened to know the entire lyrics to a clown song. In a movie that otherwise tries very hard to be realistic that felt very unnecessary and took me out of the experience and it felt very contrived and predictable after that. It takes too many obvious liberties and plot conveniences to move the story forward in an unnatural and unrefined way, and ultimately felt like they tried to disguise the poor writing and direction with a dark and gritty atmosphere instead of those elements complementing each other.The only reason to watch this movie is Phoenix's performance, which while not groundbreaking is good enough to earn an awards nomination or two. I wouldn't put it in the same league as Heath Ledger's portrayal but they were two very different roles and characters. Ledger made his joker seem effortless while one can really see the strain and work Phoenix puts in. To put it simply, Ledger made it seem natural and didn't look like he was acting while with Phoenix you really know that he is, even to the extent that it may seem like overacting at times. Perhaps owing to the more physical nature of this version of whoever this character is supposed to be, that's not necessarily a criticism.Overall an average film at best that pretends to be a lot more. I don't see this one ageing well or being remembered decades later the way Fight Club or the Scorsese movies it's ""inspired"" by, or CBM's like Dark Knight or Logan or even Tim Burton's Batman, are remembered today."
"2006","Joker",3,"I don't get what everyone else seems to be seeing.","I do agree that Joaquin's performance was great, very well done and not an easy part to pull off. That however, was the only good part of the film. Movie was dark as I expected, but so much SLOW dialog it was putting me to sleep. Parts of the movie were VERY predictable, though a couple (literally two) of surprises that were good but didn't out weigh a very slow moving poorly laid out story. I say skip this one and wait for it to hit the other subscription services, I'd ask for my money back but I did stay till the end."
"2007","Joker",10,"Amazing movie","Best acting and story. This is an Oscar winning movie"
"2008","Joker",10,"Masterpiece","Yesterday was that day, when I understand, that I have touched history. This movie will drag you in your deepest thoughts, in your darkest secrets and suffering. This masterpiece will grind you, like a meat grinder and you will watch it in silence and with open mouth. Like the whole cinema will.
I don't like comics movie, marvel is very pompous, absurd and insipid. In my opinion. It's not an art, it's just an attraction. As DC movies was too. But now DC made history, the made art and made drama.
To be more understandable. When you watch for example Avengers or League of Justice you are eating McDonald's hamburger. But when you watch Joker you are eating 1000$ stake in the most luxurious restaurant in the world."
"2009","Joker",10,"Spectacular, awesome, fantastic","The reality, far from fiction!! That what's made the movie,,, the oscar winner actor made a new joker rivalry with heath ledger joker, better joker in some people opinion.. piece of art"
"2010","Joker",10,"Film of the year (if not of the decade)","I heard all the hype about this film and as a skeptic at heart I came into this film with the most critical mindset possible.I just finished watching it and I am absolutely speechless. I don't think a film such as this has ever been made in Hollywood before. The slow and steady fall of the Joker into complete insanity is just so realistic that you feel a strange empathy towards him and almost come to justify his actions even when he commits the most heinous crimes. This is what makes this film so incredible, it takes the ""villain/good guy"" type of film making and just flips it right on its head.The cinematography captures this perfectly, you never feel rushed into a scene and yet it keeps you glued to your seat (thanks also to the music and score which contour this film perfectly).Joaquin Phoenix gives the performance of the century and only thanks to his brilliance is this film even possible. I feel sorry for the actors who gave Oscar-worthy performances this year, as Mr. Phoenix's acting in this film is just from another planet and deserves all the accolades it can get."
"2011","Joker",10,"The best thing DC has done since Dark Knight","Joker is without a doubt my new favorite DC film. It's dark and gritty but with enough psychological twists that it keeps you guessing from beginning to end. Nothing can be taken at face value and the film forces you to think from beginning to end. Don't listen to the critics, this one is worth watching multiple times in theaters."
"2012","Joker",1,"Great acting - Terrible film","I was so looking forward to this film given all the hype about brilliant acting etc but yet again what a let down!The film had no real storyline in the past or the present and although the acting was brilliant I had real trouble understanding the plot, if at all there was one.ONE STAR IS FOR THE ACTORS"
"2013","Joker",1,"Overrated boring cheap pretentious movie that makes dumb people feel smarter","People are so hyped about it because it's so pretentious, that it makes them feel like ""enlightened"" ones. I haven't heard a good review of this movie from smart or intelligent people. Only those whose main movie list consists of actions and comedies call this a piece of art.A wife of a friend even called those who hadn't liked the movie ""lemmings"" but she's the one from the countryside who dreams of expensive brands and it actually made me laugh my ass out. Now you have an idea who this movie was made for.The plot is the main weakness. The Phoenix overplays and it feels uncomfortable to watch. The camera work feels very cheap and the overall boredom of the movie makes you start noticing all the imperfections. I would give it 5-6 out of 10 but there are too many pretentious dummies who gave 10 points so I'll even out the difference."
"2014","Joker",6,"Good Film but nothing to do with the Joker","The performance of Joaquin is excellent but the story simply don't have anything to do with the Joker, it's more about a mentaly ill man struggling with his chaotic enviroment until it's overwhelmed and snaps. I would be a much better film if the title was ""Arthur"" or ""The Clown"" but the fact that it's forced to be related to the batman universe it's why i feld it didn't work."
"2015","Joker",1,"I really don't understand.","Joaquin Phoenix is good. The directing is pretty good. The writing is absolutely awful. This movie is trying so hard to be relevant and to have a 'message' that it just throws a jumbled mess of quasi-commentary at you hoping something will stick. It is completely unclear what exactly writer/director Todd Phillips is actually trying to say, if anything. Is Joker a hero of the resistance or is he an incel? Does he go crazy because he's mentally ill or because people are mean to him? Both rich people and poor people are horrible to Joker so what exactly is the class commentary? It's also confusing how Robert De Niro when this movie is clearly ripping off Taxi Driver in many ways, also with a little Mr. Robot thrown in. There's also a subplot with a neighbor that is so incredibly stupid and pointless, which actually has no bearing on the story whatsoever. The movie is also just listless and boring throughout much of it. A movie can be slow-paced without it being boring if interesting things are happening that are driving the plot towards it's conclusion. The only thing driving the story in this movie is knowing that he's going to become joker at some points, not anything that actually happens in the movie. The movie also spends like 5 minutes making fun of a little person for no clear reason. Also for people saying that this movie does a good job saying why you should be nicer to people especially if they're lonely or have mental health issues: firstly you shouldn't need a movie like this to be nice to people, secondly you can make a movie like that where the lonely/mentally ill person doesn't become a murderer since mentally ill people are more likely to be victims than perpetrators of crime, and thirdly if you want a movie showing why you need to empathize with criminals why not movies about all the people of color who have been victims of mass incarceration and were locked up on nonviolent charges instead of a movie about a white male becoming a mass murderer. This movie is terrible."
"2016","Joker",8,"Uncomfortably Satisfying","To say it was satisfying would be somewhat misleading. Joaquin Phoenix makes you feel uncomfortable almost the entire time. I couldn't help thinking about Christian Bale in The Machinist and Robert De Niro in Taxi Driver. With those comparisons, clearly I have some high praise on the acting.The film itself slowly builds momentum, but when it builds...it's really builds. Those looking for traditional comic book action may feel it moves a bit slow, but it's pace allows for the transformation to not feel superficial. When you walk out of the theater you won't know exactly how to feel, but you'll surely want to know how everyone else feels about it."
"2017","Joker",3,"Generous 3.","""Joker"" is nor a ""masterpiece"" nor is it ""flawless"" as this board boasts. It's mirely a decent origin, albeit heavy-handed as sin, with choppy flow, poor directing decisions at moments, and part brilliant part wildly overacting on Phoenix's part. The heavy handed nature of mental illness is not written well... It highlghts many different illnesses with none of which feeling whole or handled with much, if any, sense of understanding. Sprinkle in are a few light-hearted moments to remind you that ""hey, he's still funny at times""... But with the strained mental illness angle it's difficult to laugh at these moments without a bit on introspection of what it is and who it is you're laughing at. The real ""danger"" this movie poses is that it's another Hollywood blunder with mental health and its handling... Which does way more harm than good.There is no great existential pandering, ss some are saying... ""it's deep"", ""my feels"", ""It's not a superhero movie it's a character study"", regardless of what anyone wants to categorize it as.. I'll consider it a generous 3."
"2018","Joker",10,"Clear the Shelf for the Oscars","I am not a Batman fan nor am I particularly fond of Joaquin Phoenix, but this movie was truly exceptional. It started slow but built to a viscerally satisfying crescendo. I never thought I would be rooting for the Joker, but found that I did so throughout the movie. The Joker's pain was so palpable. I am filling out my Oscar pool card right now.PS This movie is dark and violent and decidedly not a super hero movie. Leave the kids at home."
"2019","Joker",10,"Hats off to Joaquin phoenix","What a legendary character and what a legendary performance by the actor. I was not able to move on from the Heath ledger performance but this movie is totally worth it. This movie deserves an oscar. It showcased the never before seen origin of The Joker himself and you will love it."
"2020","Joker",1,"Overrated and overhyped","Story was just really unconvincing. Nobody really cares that much about some random dude who is as ineloquent and uninspired as the joker is. The hype portraying the movie as painful and cruel is just cringe. To see this rated better than ""One flew over cuckoos nest"" that shows way better cruelty saddens me."
"2021","Joker",3,"Dark, serious, tense... and bad!","Somehow the darkest and most serious movies get the highest ratings. People say that this movie is so thrilling and that Joaquin Phoenix deserves an Oscar but at the end of the day, it wasn't entertainment. There were so many evil moments and dark scenes but what's so good about that?This movie was almost like instructions on how to be a psycho. They flipped the usual idea and boundaries of good and evil for the audience to feel sorry for the bad guy. People seem to think this is a good thing. It's bad!The point of a movie is to entertain audiences and this movie just made me feel depressed and miserable. I'll have to watch a movie where the hero is clear and the villain is clear so I can actually be entertained. The fundemental and successful formula for a film."
"2022","Joker",10,"Masterpiece *Movie Of the Year* Best Actor - Joaquin Phoenix*","Wow I honestly gotta tell you, it's one of the best movies I've seen in years. All from the cinematography, thumping and sadden soundtrack, all the way to the OMG performance by Joaquin Phoenix, it's dark, it's evolving, twisting and wow just you can feel deep down to your bones his emotions portraying the Joker.Just alone watching hearing The Jokers laugh is so twisty and evil and you could hear his sadness coming out from his mouth. You could hear the hours of practice just on the laugh alone and his method acting is perfectly on point along with his subtle gestures and dance that is done perfectly as the Joker should be. This movie has all the psychological twisting that made you believed and immersed into the movie, I was totally shocked and overwhelmed by everything even after I left the cinema. Just mind-blowned.When I was watching in just now in the cinema, more than half the cinema cheered and applauded on certain scenes. And almost the entire patron stayed until the last credit. If u looked closely even Joker costume were evolving and changing from time to time based on his journey and experienced and just looked at the final and true form just looked absolutely stunning. Just the excitement and the dialogues told by The Joker is just so heart-crushing and it just made me felt so bad for the Joker, and it's the first time where I sided with the evil character or maybe he is the hero of this movie, who knows ?Honestly, u have to watch it, it's one of the best performance u be watching in a Long time, movies like this deserves to be watched on the Big Screen, go find the best cinema in town and enjoy the wild ride of emotions and fear and anger, just satisfying!!"
"2023","Joker",3,"Overhyped","I sat through this slowwwwww movie and would gladly have left half way into it. Its a boring movie until the last 5 minutes... overhyped as usual....the violence must have been cut out of the version i seen as i think i have seen more gore in a disney movie"
"2024","Joker",10,"Cinematic Masterpiece","Acting, Cinematography, Music, Screenplay, Costumes, Gotham etc everything is 10/10.Oscar worthy performanceby by Joaquin Phoenix.Amazing directing by Todd Phillips & amazing cinematography by Lawrence Sher."
"2025","Joker",10,"A Huge Leap In The Right Direction For DC Films","This is a dark, twisted, sad and sympathetic take of possibly the most enduring comic book villain of all time. DC would be wise to keep taking risks like this and blurring the genre lines because this is where they have a change to excel in an area the MCU won't cross into for fear of not being family friendly. If you cannot match Marvel in an interconnected universe then the answer lies squarely in making quality solo, if not one-off films like this. Phoenix is one of the top actors of his generation and I think it is possible to judge this take on Joker without even comparing to Ledger's. Both are genius and both very different. I have to go off topic and say the one person I'd love to have seen play a live action version was Mark Hamill at the right point in time but we'll have to just give him the best maniacal Joker laugh award and be content with that."
"2026","Joker",10,"By far the best DC movie to date, Joaquin Phoenix was perfect.","Wow, what a movie! I have to admit, When I first heard Joaquin Phoenix was going to be the joker, I was surprised. I wasn't sure how he was going to pull it off. I was hoping it wasn't going to be another cheesy rendition full of fluff and unrealistic explanations of how the Joker came to be. One where my (adult) son wouldn't have to keep nudging me to wake me up. I was pleasantly surprised on well Todd Phillips' version played and Joaquin's acting was superb. You could feel the anguish his character was going through right up to the point he lost his mind. Just an excellent, well acted movie that you almost forget is derived from a DC comic."
"2027","Joker",7,"Joaquin Phoenix delivers but the story doesn't","While I enjoyed the film, it felt pretty short. When ""The End"" appeared on the screen I couldn't help but think - ""That's it?""Joaquin Phoenix was fantastic with his new take on the Joker, and it's mesmerizing to see his facial expressions keep changing. And his Joker laugh is unique - sinister and full of Joker's madness.However despite some minor plot twists, most of interesting bits in the film have already been shown in the trailers. Don't expect much action like in The Dark Knight trilogy. Despite the much hyped gun violence, there are less guns in this movie than in any other Batman flick.This is not a bad film, but it's not a great one either. Watch it only for Joaquin's performance."
"2028","Joker",10,"Masterpiece!","JOKER is a gift to the audiences. I felt as a privileged person to sit in a movie theater and watching it. Joaquin Phoenix and Todd Phillips gave to the world of cinema a rear pearl. I don't know what people are complaining about: this is really something else."
"2029","Joker",10,"Spare me the ""best comic book movie ever"" nonsense.","It premiered last night in Sydney and I was lucky enough to watch this masterpiece first hand.
The movie is flawless but because of its approach on mental illness and the execution of Joaquin Phoenix. The 80's settings brings a darker filter to it, creating a scenario where you see no hope for a person as the main character to survive.
The movie does not praise violence and it's far from being about making the Joker a ""hero"" or him starting a movement, it's all about a man trying to find himself. Violence is what happens in between and labelling the movie as such is a misinterpretation of the picture.
Also, if the movie had no reference whatsoever of the Batman universe it would work the same, it is a movie that sustains itself from beginning to end delivering frame by frame what it was meant to."
"2030","Joker",10,"One of THE BEST PERFORMANCE ever!","Wow, it takes a while to find the right words to describe this movie. It's different! It feels like a character study, almost like a documentary but at the same time as if you'd be watching a horror drama movie as intense as it is and realistic.
It touches on mental health issues which sadly this country is struggling with but won't admit to it. This film has the best character development I could possibly think of! Now I will say this:
JOKER is the last movie you'd ever want to show to kids! Not even teenagers should see this! It might be a tough one for them to see as it is brutal, bloody and might even be simply too much to handle. I saw some walk out of the theater and if you're a very sensitive person you might do the same! However, it is by far the best film and performance of the year and there's no doubt Joaquin Phoenix should win all awards for this including the Oscar! And in my opinion while it is a different take on the JOKER, this is the best portrayal of the JOKER.
Go see this with an open mind, and if possibly without expectations. This will definitely spark many conversations and most likely arguments as well."
"2031","Joker",9,"DARK AND DEPRESSING.","Dark, depressing and unsettling film with a haunting score. Incredible acting, directing and screenplay. Joaquin killed it. 5 out of 5 stars! Mental health is so important guys!!!"
"2032","Joker",1,"Better if didn't saw","Disturbing. Just got out of the movie. My humor was much better before seeing it. At first feel pity for the guy suffering, but he lacks charm and then well he is just a killer. Heath Ledger was far better."
"2033","Joker",10,"Leave your American Politics at the door and enjoy this film","No one cares about your country's inability to separate Reel and Real influences. Film is a medium not just for political ideals or comments.Watch it"
"2034","Joker",10,"¡absolutely incredible!","I can't believe that such a totally perfect and spectacular movie I just saw, I am completely stunned. This movie needs to be in the Oscars. Nominated to:This film must be nominated for the following awards:
Best movie
best Actor
Best screenplay
Best address
Best Adapted Screenplay
Best soundtrack
Best sound mixing"
"2035","Joker",1,"Derivative and Uninspired","There is doing an homage and then there is borrowing wholesale from other material. This film is little more than a remake of ""Taxi Driver"" with elements (most notably the end) borrowed from ""Network"".
In the case of ""Taxi Driver"" there are whole lines of dialogue, characters and scenes that are lifted from it and placed in this movie. Except the execution isn't as polished, the acting not of the same caliber and the story not as original.Watch ""Taxi Driver"" and ""Network"", this film was made 40 years earlier and was made better."
"2036","Joker",6,"Joking?","Phoenix was over the top spooky and I guess very good in this role, but as a movie there wasnt much there. His mom played by Frances Conroy was good. I admire her talent, DeNiro doesnt move me much the past few years (decades?) and his teeth look like Martin Scorsese used some CGI magic left over from the Irishman to whiten them. I think the high rating for the film here are based on Phoenix's performance and not the film. A performance which I fear we will one day view as overrated."
"2037","Joker",2,"Overacting Galore","I was underwhelmed - to say it friendly - but not surprised by the fact. Because Hollywood has lost its magic looong time ago. IMHO no. bo. dy gives a damn about Darth Vader's Childhood or Joker's relationship with his mother. All we want for centuries is a proper boogeyman. If you overpaid LaLaLand-Schmocks won't jump from the stupid Prequel-explains-it-all-train - please give us at least solid filmmaking. Joker is a mess. No story, no finesse, no build-up, no surprises, no ideas. But a load of layman-psychology that should make even 12y olds roll their eyes; a cacophony of more or less unrelated scenes; cheesy taxi-driver-moments without any impact; massive overacting by Phoenix and no subtle sinister Joker moments except for the two second Elevator-Scene we all know (and love) from the trailer. rating 9.0? A joke. Heath Ledger, I miss you."
"2038","Joker",3,"fell asleep","It's just that boring. really can't understand what the hype is all about??!"
"2039","Joker",1,"Overrated and boring","One of the worst movies I have ever seen. Ok, maybe not but they hype surrounding the movie killed it for me. It's not a masterpiece but an ok film. Why the one star? Way too many 10's! For once I actually agree with the actual critics who graded this film."
"2040","Joker",10,"10/10","The Joker won. Absolutely tremendous, what acting skills are we talking about ? It is amazing!"
"2041","Joker",10,"Lives up to the hype","A breath of fresh airThink heath ledgers joker in taxi driver with a game of thrones like soundtrack"
"2042","Joker",10,"Defenantly second actor to get an oscar from the joker, a dark masterpiece","This Is without a doubt the best protryal of the joker, the way he slowly gets turned by society and becomes skinnier and crazier,defenanrly one of the if not the best movie of 2019"
"2043","Joker",3,"Not real Joker","This movie is poorly done as to how it tells the story. It is a dark movie showing the problem of mental illness"
"2044","Joker",3,"Went into this blind, and i didnt enjoy it at all really. disappointing.","I didnt really know much about this movie. I hadnt seen any trailers for it or anything but i decided to give it a go while i was stoned with my mate Steve. we actually got tickets for a different movie but couldnt find our screen so we ended up in the screen showing The Joker. It wasnt til about 45 minutes in that I realised this movie is no good. I couldnt understand a lot of what certain actors were saying it was really mumbled and low quality. The story is so confusing its hard to keep track of who's who. There's a lot of scenes where literally nothing happens except for people talking or walking down corridors. I whispered to my mate Steve about an hour in to see if he thought it was as bad as i did, but he had fallen asleep.The good thing about the movie is the acting. the geezer who plays the joker is very good at it. Also there is a few very funny scenes near the end but other than that this movie is overly long, too complex, not enough action, and poor directing."
"2045","Joker",10,"Best Joker ever","That is best joker can i see
And joaquin phoenix will win the oscar"
"2046","Parasite",10,"One of the best films of this decade","I am remarkably stingy with my 10/10 ratings. I'll be the first person to acknowledge this. Of the roughly 2600 titles I've rated on here, only 34 have a 10.
Parasite is one of them. If this isn't a masterpiece, then I don't know what is.I'm going to keep it vague on the plot-front, because I didn't know anything about it going in, and was really excited to see it progress and unfold in satisfying, unexpected ways.What I will say is that this film, more than just about any other I've seen, put me through so many different emotional states during its 132-minute runtime, and did so without ever feeling muddled or tonally inconsistent. Parts of this movie were hilarious. Parts were heartbreaking. Other parts were insanely suspenseful (I'm honestly not sure if I've felt this close to the edge of my seat since the final season of Breaking Bad, way back in 2013).And it does all this while being perfectly paced, beautifully directed, and amazingly acted from every single member of its cast. All the characters are understandable and sympathetic to some degree; the amount of conflict, drama and tension derived from a narrative with no clear heroes and villains is staggering. You come to care for just about all of them.I'm stumped to come up with any flaws for this movie. And sure, I've seen many movies that are hard to fault, but it's rare that a movie appeals to me on a gut level and excites me to this degree while also being so close to technically perfect. It's extremely entertaining, thoroughly moving in so many different ways, and as icing on the cake there's a ton of social commentary and some heavy themes to chew on once the movie's over (and this one's not going to leave my head for a while, I can tell).Catch this one when you can and believe the hype. Joon-Ho Bong has made many great films (and so far no bad one's), but this even manages to stand head and shoulders above all the others.When it comes time to consider what the best film of the 2010s was, this one will surely be up there."
"2047","Parasite",8,"You name a genre, this movie covers it","I can't remember the last time I saw a movie that contained as many genres as 'Parasite'. The movie starts out almost like an 'Ocean's Eleven' heist film and then expands into a comedy, mystery, thriller, drama, romance, crime and even horror film. It really did have everything and it was strikingly good at all of them too.I love a film that respects its audience. There are so many details in this movie that are crucially important and yet the film trusts its audience to notice them and acknowledge them without ramming them down our throats. There are a lot of layers to this film and I suspect for this reason its rewatch-ability factor will be very high.The film was incredibly entertaining too. I can't think of a boring scene in this movie and yet on the surface for large parts of the film you would say not a lot is happening, at least in terms of action. Fascinating characters and brilliant dialogue are what create this. I had a great time with 'Parasite' and I think most that give it a chance will too."
"2048","Parasite",10,"Meritocracy: it's metaphorical","In a meritocracy, success and fortune are reserved for those who deserve it--those who develop solid plans according to their talents and abilities and who execute those plans through hard work and determination. Anyone can rise to the top, and for some lucky Cinderella, plucked from the cinders and gussied up in gowns, the meritocracy represents the heights of perfect egalitarian society: ""I started with nothing and ended up with everything I ever desired; you, too, can achieve you dreams, if only you try.""The promise of unobstructed sunshine at the top of the mountain becomes justification for bitter competition, backstabbing, deceit, and callousness. You climb the crooked ladder until you make it to the straight one, and then, perhaps, when you at last feel secure, you can afford to be kind and confident and generous. ""It's easy to be nice when you're rich,"" the mother in this film (Jang Hye-jin) at one point observes.But it's a very long and very crooked ladder, and sometimes the rungs give out beneath your grip, and sometimes they've been dangerously greased by those who climbed before you, and sometimes the ladder itself is simply kicked down--either by those above you or, just as often, by those staring up from the ground below. There are a lot of people trying to climb that one ladder.But in a meritocracy, you can't blame the ladder or the other people trying to climb it. Nor can you blame the fact that all the good stuff is kept so many stories up instead of down at the ground where everyone can easily reach it. No, you must blame yourself. You should have tread more carefully. You should have climbed more quickly. You should have used a firmer and more precise grip, anticipated disasters, and known just when to leap. If you fail in a meritocracy, it's all your fault. You should have tried harder. Better luck next time.Kim Ki-woo (Choi Woo-sik), the young man who is the main character of PARASITE, several times refers to ""metaphors,"" and the film itself is, of course, a metaphor. On a surface level, viewers are treated to a very thrilling, engaging, well-paced and well-plotted crime story. At all times, however, bubbling up from beneath the slick surface of this genre film, there are deeply personal, meaningful truths that should resonate with almost any viewer. These insights are rarely foregrounded. They are so subtly interwoven, in fact, that if you're like me, you may be completely surprised when the final shots of the film roll and you realize that you are emotionally devastated by the intimate, humanist story you've just witnessed. Bong Joon-ho's filmmaking is so extraordinary here that he'll make you fully invested in the lives of his characters without you even realizing he's done so.I want to avoid spoilers here, but suffice it to say that PARASITE is a masterpiece--beautifully lensed, enthrallingly edited, superbly acted, and intimately involving.South Korea has a population that is one sixth the size of the United States, and that population is stacked into skyscrapers in an area slightly smaller than the state of Kentucky. Higher education is widespread, so parents with means try to make their children stand above the pack by hiring them tutors and signing them up for extracurriculars and afterschool programs. I lived in Korea once, and the children I taught there were sometimes engaged in learning ten to twelve hours a day, six days a week--public school, English-immersion private school, piano class, soccer team, taekwondo, math camp, chess club, and so on. I routinely worked sixty to seventy hours a week on salary, but at bars I would meet young men my age who were expected to work far more than that, who slept at their desks so that they did not need to pry themselves from work for too long. As the father (Song Kang-ho) in the film at one point says, this is a country where fifty young men with college degrees apply for a mere security guard job. One can't afford not to struggle.The themes of this story are not just localized to Korea, however. They are the story of global capitalism, and the specter of American materialism (and imperialism; note the ""Indians"") looms heavily over the film. Meritocracy makes cannibals of us all. It's nice to dream, and sometimes the dreamers who plan and struggle well enough can indeed climb out of the basement and into the sunshine, and how nice an ending it is when they do. But the film also makes it clear that sometimes all that planning and dreaming may be, maybe, just whims and fancy. More often, it seems, our pipe dreams are content to leave us with nothing more than the whiff of spewed sewage."
"2049","Parasite",10,"A true masterpiece.","This movie is a gosh darn masterpiece. It will make you belly laugh, it will chill you to the bone, and it will make you shed a tear. This movie will stay with you long after the credits are over.If you plan on watching this movie, AVOID SPOILERS AT ALL COSTS."
"2050","Parasite",10,"Great","The most original film of 2019 and it is wickedly funny and darkly disturbing all at the same time. The narrative and the actors were excellent. One of the better endings of a movie in quite a while. Class warfare at its best."
"2051","Parasite",7,"Perhaps I just did not get it","Most of the time when my opinion does not jibe with the majority I am confident in my assessment. With this one I am not so sure for some reason. That being said I think it is ridiculously overrated. I just really did not find it to be anything special. I thought the Japanese movie shoplifters was infinitely better."
"2052","Parasite",5,"Overhyped, not that interesting and long","I'm sorry but I must be living on another planet - I can't understand why this film won an oscar and why some are rating it a 10.
I felt a little bored in parts and I felt uncomfortable. Reading some other reviews after the film, maybe there were some aspects I hadn't analysed and worked out intellectually. But then still I felt it was totally over hyped."
"2053","Parasite",6,"Did I miss something?","I came to this movie with an open mind, despite the hoo ha around it. Stylistically yep, I can see the hoo haa. The same goes for the acting, once again exceptional . The humour was also done really well. It's just that past the halfway mark it becomes a bit 'meh'. Kind of similar in a way to the film 'us', once it did it's core 'reveal'. It's good that western audiences will watch it and hopefully realise there is a film industry outside of the west..but this film just an ok for me"
"2054","Parasite",8,"An original dark comedy about class struggles","This is a well written and well perfomed original film. With a lot of repetitive cinema these day i felt this was something new. I felt connected and engaged with the character throughout the film. There are several well directed tense moments throughout the film. A popular topic of class struggled well portrayed. Its always nice to see foreign language films having worldwide success."
"2055","Parasite",10,"A brilliant piece of art which will slowly grows on you!","Well written and performed also technically shines cinematography & bgm are too good and there's not even a single lag it's perfectly edited. Probably the best experience in recent times. Its pure art resembles the modern society the emotions they had shelved are insanely exceptional a layered masterpiece. If you like dark thrillers then you shouldn't miss Mr. Bong joon-ho's Parasite. Definitely tops the list of best movies in 2019."
"2056","Parasite",6,"Too hyped, not too bad.","Here's how i rate a movie the fast way, i ask myself two questions.
Who am I gonna recommend this movie to ?
Am i gonna remember this movie a year from now ?Beside the somewhat chaotically random events happening in the movie, Parasite wants to be way too many things at the same time, a deep serious movie with a message, a comedy, a drama, and a thriller, the mixture left me feeling confused and not really sure what to feel once it ended.It wasn't too bad, some scenes were super intense and enjoyable for thriller lovers. But I don't see myself recommending it to anyone who wants all these genres crammed in a single movie, nor do I feel anything from the story was amazing enough to stick with me in the future."
"2057","Parasite",5,"Overrated","I find it somewhat odd that some people have interpreted this film as anticapitalist. It shines a very narrow light on poverty but it is all conveyed in a very surreal scenario which makes it quite difficult to emotionally engage with the situations that transpire. However, that's not the only reason.The main characters are not particularly likeable, which I'm sure defenders of the film would describe them as morally grey, given the prevailing cultural obsession with the moral ambiguity.It's this morally ambiguous narrative that intends to blur the line of what is good and bad. Nevertheless, this blurring as well as the general surrealness didn't compel me to emotionally engage with the film's story as much as I would've liked. As a result, I found that it really lacks something. It feels like it has rattled out of someone's head, unedited."
"2058","Parasite",10,"One of the most thought provoking films I've ever seen","Do you want to see a movie that will have your stomach in knots, anxious during many scenes? Do you want to see a movie that will have you conflicted on who you're rooting for? Regardless of your answers, see Parasite.
Parasite ticks along quietly until it is booming in your ears. The symbolism varies. Sometimes it is obvious, Bong Joon-ho might as well have made the subtitles spell it out. But other times it is more subtle, and you might realize a connection or symbolism days or weeks after. Bong Joon-ho is a master at that.
The conversation that it sparks is worth the $13-20 it costs to see the film. Parasite has made me think more than most films I've seen. Give it a watch, see it with friends or family and the dinner table will have a conversation overflowing with opinions and realizations."
"2059","Parasite",9,"Achieves what Jordan Peele set out to do with Us","As a film about a family imposing on another, and keeping dark secrets hidden beneath the surface, Parasite achieves what Jordan Peele set out to do with Us: tell a multi-layered story in a widely entertaining manner, but without sacrificing the believability of its central narrative.That's not to say that Us is an ineffective film by any means, but when it comes to crafting weighty social commentaries under the guise of lighter fare, writer-director Bong Joon-ho is in a class of his own.The film follows a lower-class South Korean family as they slowly integrate themselves in the lives of an upper-class family and their lavish household. As their entanglement is spun out of a web of deceit, the lowly family find themselves skating on thin ice when it comes to keeping up appearances.It's a twisty satire on social-economic disparities in South Korean society that swings broadly in tone, and sometimes threatens to tip over the edge, but never feels less than meticulously calculated in its tonal shifts.However, to reveal anything more about the story would be to take away from the overall experience, as each act is marked by a major plot twist or revelation that keeps the film one step ahead of the viewer at all times. Go in blind if you can and expect an unforgettable ride."
"2060","Parasite",7,"Lacks any realistic human dimension","South Korean director Bong Joon-ho (""Okja"") says that he always tries to overturn viewer expectations and hopes that his latest film succeeds in this way. Palme d'Or winner at the 2019 Cannes Film festival, Bong's Parasite (Gisaengchung) does indeed thwart expectations, but the question is - to what end? Defying any strict genre classification, the film is a conglomeration of comedy, drama, satire, crime, horror, and anything else you can throw into the mix. Bong sees the film as a statement about the ""ranks and classes"" inherent in capitalism that are invisible to the eye, and says that the film ""depicts the inevitable cracks that appear when two classes brush up against each other in today's increasingly polarized society."" Unfortunately, the characterizations are filled with so many stereotypes that the lack of any realistic human dimension leaves Bong's statement without much impact.The film looks at class differences between two families - one well-to-do, and the other n'eer do well. For the Kim family, life is a struggle. They live in a cramped bug-infested basement apartment without many amenities except for a toilet built on kind of a shelf. The father Ki-taek (Song Kang-ho, ""Snowpiercer"") has failed in business and has accumulated many debts. His son and daughter Ki-woo (Choi Woo-sik, ""Train to Busan"") and Ki-jung (Park So-dam, ""Cinderella and Four Knights"" TV series) have repeatedly failed college entrance exams. The mother Chung-sook (Hyae-jin Jang, ""Adulthood"") along with the two children fold boxes for a delivery company, but cannot even get that right. Not to worry, they leave their windows open when the fumigators come around to get some free extermination and steal free Wi-Fi from the next door coffee shop.On the other hand, the nouveau riche Park family has all the advantages. Mr. Park (Lee Sun-kyun, ""Jo Pil-ho: The Dawning Rage"") is the CEO of a high-tech company and the family lives in a spacious, modernistic home protected by sturdy concrete walls. He has an attractive somewhat fragile wife Yeon-kyo (Jo Yeo-jeong, ""The Target""), a teenage daughter Da-hye (Jung Ji-so, ""The Tiger""), and a hyper-active young son Da-song (Jung Hyun-jun). Being wealthy and somewhat elitist in their attitude, for Bong, they are ideally suited to be torn apart by ruthless grifters. With the aid of a friend, Ki-woo is hired to be a private tutor for Da-hye. Of course, he has to forge university documents to convince the trusting Mrs. Park of his competence. With that conquest out of the way, the cunning Ki-woo concocts a scheme to secure jobs in the Park household for his entire family.Convinced that their young son is a budding Picasso, Mrs. Park hires Ki-jung as an art teacher, then falls for invented stories impugning the character of their driver and housekeeper to provide some more employment opportunities for the Kims, this time for the deadbeat dad Ki-taek and his wife Chung-sook. Bong said that ""Sometimes with the characters in my films, I look at them cynically, but most of the time I have a lot of compassion for the characters, even with the villains."" This compassion, however, does not seem to extend to the loyal, hardworking household workers, their work scammed out of existence. Without going into detail, the whole escapade backfires in a twist that is over-the-top unsettling even though utterly implausible.Worthy of a Mack Sennett comedy, a sweet family drama turns into a tumultuous melange of hidden chambers, revenge, bloody violence, a torrential rainstorm, people hiding under beds, and any other mayhem that may come to mind. To be clear, Parasite can be very funny and some of the satire is sharp-edged, yet it is hardly, as one critic described it, ""a masterful dissection of social inequality."" When asked what he wanted viewers to get out of the film, Bong said, ""I just hope that it gives audiences a lot to think about. It is in parts funny, frightening, and sad, and if it makes viewers feel like sharing a drink and talking over all the ideas they had while watching it, I'll wish for nothing more."" Enjoy the drink. In a little while, you may have trouble remembering what the film was about."
"2061","Parasite",5,"People going crazy like it's otherworldly!!!","Just won Oscars cz concept was new, but this itself doesn't make it a better movie than Joker. Over hyped, Mediocre and people reviewing it in mob mentality. Nothing against Korean movies."
"2062","Parasite",5,"Not that deep, severely overrated","There are a few suspenseful scenes and a decent plot, along with comedic dialogue, but that's it. It's not a ""metaphorical masterpiece"" that some critics and users are saying. I feel as though too many people are trying to be expert critics like on that episode of South Park where the entire town writes crazy yelp reviews for all the restaurants."
"2063","Parasite",6,"Ok film, but that's all. Overrated for sure.","The film is ok but that's as far as I go. It's worth a watch but only a score of 6 for me. It's not a masterpiece, it's not film of the decade it's not even film of the year. I don't understand how people can give it 10, 10 is a perfect score. 10 is unachievable in my opinion as nothing is perfect."
"2064","Parasite",9,"Whose the parasite and whose the cow?!","What an amazing film! Clearly an essay on the class divide. Writing lovable but nasty people is tough, but perfectly executed here.They quite clearly cross the line, and when I mean ""they"" I mean bother the working class and the upper class.
You could easily argue that ""parasite"" refers to one family trying to suck another family dry. Or that the upper class is draining the labour of the lower class, and expecting them to be grateful about it too!
There is also something about the American Indian theme, a metaphor for dying cultural traditions which are being replaced by modernity? Nature is dog eat dog? Or is it a homage to an ""idyllic"" past where Native American culture was relatively classless?Either way a must watch if you can handle subtitles!"
"2065","Parasite",7,"good movie but i couldn't understand how it won the best picture","I watched this movie. it's a good movie but i couldn't understand how it won the best picture. i think this movie doesn't deserve that for sure."
"2066","Parasite",8,"A cordial invitation to welcome this Parasite gem in the 21st century full of remakes and reboots.","Following the step of Get Out, it is a powerful film that comprises of metaphors and allegories which need you to think beyond a certain level as they are manifested throughout. No worries, you will understand the film even if you fail to unlock the codes unlike Mother! & Us.Parasite welcomes the audience into multi-genres and tonal shifts that mix and take its turn after every act. Pure comedy, dark comedy to heavy dramas, horror, thriller, mystery, you name it. The director, Bong Joon-Ho wonderfully converts them smoothly without letting the audience feels bizarre of the transformation.With merely 10 characters into play, Parasite brilliantly executes layer after layer of interesting character developments which progresses the plot forward to ultimately produce a comprehensive film.Parasite professionally handles cinematic tricks to synchronize every possible element for the greater good such as excellent use of cinematography techniques with superb artistic values, information-packed dialogues, lavish architecture production designs & vibrant colours.Quite certain scenes feel a little too long and weary. If they can cut short and add new scenes instead, the pacing will be better and more entertaining.Majestic musical set pieces is utilized in the background to help produce a richer tone to the distinct elements.The suspenseful moments would have you at the edge of your seat without noticing until the point you recall your experience inside the hall.Verdict: A strongly crafted masterpiece film on social themes and satire that finds its place in audience's heart.In short, it is one of those episodes of Black Mirror."
"2067","Parasite",10,"A Masterpiece/Work of Art.","As I write this, I want to describe my raw initial state after I finished the film, I'm in a state of complete awe, staring into the wall kind of awe, Parasite is truly a work of art, a sheer masterpiece.
This film oozes with mastery, every little detail tells a story of its own, I was drawn to it like a moth to a flame, it grips hard and it never lets go, it sways between genres gracefully, it offers comedy both dark and light, drama, horror, thrill, and it's all packaged so seamlessly, conveyed to us throughout breathtaking performances across the board, I've watched my share of Korean Cinema to know that's a common thing but Parasite takes it to a whole other level, it materializes thoughts and ideas, things words can not communicate, it is extremely rare to experience such a thing in film, I can only name a small number of movies that actually made me feel this way, just incredible.
Director Bong Joon Ho proves that he is a master within his own cross-genre domain, he takes charge and you actually feel like you're in safe hands watching this, he shapes the scenes perfectly, A true master of his trade, Thank You.
In all honesty, I feel like I went through an experiment where the time went still and I experienced a piece of art such as this, I absloutely, wholeheartedly loved every single second of this film, MINDBLOWING."
"2068","Parasite",6,"My God People, Really?? Get Your heads out of the sand","After reading all the glowing reviews, especially about how this film is one of the best of the decade I had to see it for myself- the plot it self wasn't anything ground breaking, and while the technical aspect of the film were flawless and i enjoyed it for the first hour, the ending was a total let down (lots of plot holes that I won't get into here) I agree with some other reviewers, the Park family weren't your typical rich snobs, the father worked for his money and came home home and was always there for his children and polite to the domestics, the problem was the family was just too darn naive and foolish, but not terrible people by any means, all in all just a mixed bag, Shoplifters was a much more engaging and heart felt piece of foreign cinema, and I highly recommend watching that!!"
"2069","Parasite",5,"The only horror about this film...","Is the fact that people who voted for it to win the Cannes film festival award and those who gave it anything higher than a 7/10 on this platform, actually exist.A family living below the poverty line in a 1st world nation whose kids couldn't pass the national exams or fold a pizza box would suddenly become world class con artistes overnight infiltrating a wealthy family? And when things took a dark turn, we the audience are supposed to feel sorry for them, just because they are poor, nevermind their greed, pride and total lack of character?Please don't insult our intelligence, at least 1 out of 3 accounts here are real and still give honest review."
"2070","Parasite",10,"Thy shall not ridicule fellas with body odor. Definitely deserves the best picture award.","Finally saw this much talked about film. As a fan of Korean thrillers, this film surpassed my expectations.
The film is about a poor family who cleverly n cunningly become employed by a wealthy couple, posing as unrelated, highly qualified individuals.The film begins like a dark satire, it then proceeds into a captivating thriller n ends like a surreal crime.The film is very entertaining inspite of the sad stuff shown about poor fellas but mind u, it is not at all demeaning. It is very gripping n weirdly hilarious."
"2071","Parasite",7,"Observations","Firstly, movie hype of the wildfire sort (ovation, talk of Cannes, etc) grossly overinflates expectations for a film. If you've read 50 reviews calling something 'best film ever' and then watch said film, I can almost guarantee you will not share their opinion afterwards. No, it's not a flawless masterpiece that will be remembered for centuries - but just because others think so is no reason to hate on it either, since it is undoubtedly an accomplished and entertaining piece of filmmaking.Haters may hate for ideological reasons: something is definitely fishy with the skewed helpful/unhelpful ratio on most of these reviews (it's 1:5 to 1:10 for most reviews), which may or may not point to some sort campaign of orchestrated manipulation, or at the very least an outpouring of emotion. Clearly this has people roiled up!Which is funny, because it's not really all that clear what there is to get roiled up about! Lots of reviewers talk about the underlying themes and motifs and whatnot, vaguely alluding to what those are - class struggle, a dash of political allegory - but no one so far has written up any sort of concrete analysis that decodes the film, pointing out the literary, cinematic, political, or psychological allusions in specific scenes. If you read enough of these reviews, you know there's always at least one arch-geek who takes on the challenge and posts something that borders on coherent and insightful. The North Korea references would be a great place to start, perhaps.But yeah, I suspect this aggravated the sensibilities of some anti-anti-capitalist types, who rail against any lefty do-gooder subtext and want their films all storytelling and no agenda. (This is a silly expectation, since most storytelling throughout history is overtly agenda-driven.) Though it's definitely not a 'pro-capitalism' film, it is quite ambiguous about its morality, and there is no one to really root for or hate. This is actually one of its more subtle but grandiose achievements.More to the point are criticisms of the acting, which may or may not be annoying (I don't speak Korean, so I cannot fully judge). Plot is on the improbable side, although the 'fun factor' of watching this unravel counterweighs the contrived nature of the initial setup. The final stretch doesn't quite deliver (if it did, this would be a 9-10), and there's an unnecessary and rather maudlin coda.But overall, strong work, and definitely one of the year's must-see films."
"2072","Parasite",7,"best 2019 movie????","Good movie, interesting story line, but never in a million years could win a oscar for best movie of the year...Political decision for sure! that's the world we live in unfortunately."
"2073","Parasite",6,"Learn to think for yourself.","There are lots of great movies out there. This is just not one of them. Why? Because it's predictable to a degree that I have seldom experienced. All major events can be predicted way ahead of them happening, which makes watching this movie into nothing but a waiting game. It's not deep and it's definitely not clever.If the director should ever reveal that he made this movie as an experiment to explore how hollow of a movie you can get away with and still have the world hyped, I wouldn't be the least bit surprised."
"2074","Parasite",9,"Class struggle. After Karl Marx and Victor Hugo, here is Joon-ho Bong","This cinematographic gem has been recently rewarded by the prestigious Palme d'Or at the Cannes Festival. If I have one and only one advice to give you: go savor this fabulous movie with a strict minimum of information! Indeed, this film might schematically be split in two parts, the second one being quite surprising and unpredictable. The script is excellent and the casting is globally sumptuous, especially the gorgeous Yeo-jeong Jo for whom I may confess I have a crush.As a postscript, an anecdote certainly insignificant but literally astonishing when you're French: in the middle of the film, the proletarian family gives itself up to an orgy, the coffee table being covered with manifold dishes including two French cheeses as industrial as cheap: « Le rustique » and « Bresse bleu ». Unbelievable!"
"2075","Parasite",8,"Why people should watch foreign films!","The movie Parasite is one of the many films that reinforce why people should give up this ridiculous thing of not watching foreign films. People are so scared of subtitles that they are missing out on some of the best films ever made. After 5 minutes of subtitles you get used to it and don't even realise you're reading.Anyway back to this movie. Parasite is a fantastic film that really has no set genre as you will experience a drama, thriller, romance and horror all in one! Unlike most films you actually can sympathise with 99% of the characters even if they are seen as more of a villain. I wont give anything away but I will say that Parasite is a must watch and one of the best movies of 2019!"
"2076","Parasite",9,"It's nature.","This film shows humanity in all its glory. We can try to claim the rich are evil and the poor deserve better but these are delusions we create to make us feel better. People are terrible. They are selfish. They are greedy. They are unkind. It's part of human nature. No matter how much you have, or how little, humanity still exists, and humanity is the problem.All the problems in the world that make us suffer day to day are caused in the end because we are human. Nothing we can do about it.The movie was good. Lol."
"2077","Parasite",8,"Brilliant","Great film-making with unique plot,starts slow but never boring,ending hits you like a hammer,not perfect but still great,well done Bong joon ho and Kang ho song,everything you guys touch turns into gold."
"2078","Parasite",8,"You know is Korean movie when something like this happen.","From my exposure to Korean Drama/Horror I know that something at some point will go horribly wrong and the end there is no happy end for nobody. And yet this was so unexpected when I watch this movie. Great drama, 8/10."
"2079","Parasite",NA,"In any successful black comedy, GREED is GOOD.","My rating: A-plus.
(Just like what others have already stated in this comment section: BEST WATCHED WHEN ONE DOESN'T HAVE MUCH PRIOR KNOWLEDGE OF THIS FILM:)
Starts with an unemployed Ki-woo who was asked to replace his college student friend in being a rich girl's English tutor even though he hasn't got qualifications apart from having been a repeat-taker of university entrance exams...This one ends up becoming a thorough scrutiny of the gluttonous side of human nature which is always a welcome and an essential ingredient in any bitter satire that's in the same vein as one of those Coen Brothers' films. And this one needs to feed off the audience's unabashed derisive laughter for it to deemed a worthy yang to the yin of that J-P Jeunet classic Le fabuleux destin d'Amélie Poulain or even to a lesser extent C Nolan's Inception. Whereas the wistful rom-com and the meta sci-fi have its darker elements in the narrative neatly tucked away in its recesses, the Palme d'Or recipient does the exact opposite. Such dualism that occurs in the cinematic world is much needed which serves to cleanse each other's cinematic excesses. And it took a long time for a film like this Korean one to come by and serve as a worthy film to counterbalance the sentimentalism which can only be considered to be a magnet very much ripe for any Cy-Bugs to devour wantonly in such an orgiastic frenzy.But the film itself can be considered as sharing the same kindredship and is way aligned more to the thematic and aesthetic sensibilities of Yorgos Lanthimos' ones (Dogtooth, The Lobster, or even the Favourite), if not quite to be considered as it's ugly, distant cocaine-junkie cousin, shares the same filmic DNA sure, though fun at parties but can be a bit of a deadweight accomplice. Whereas Boon-J-H's film is more rooted in emotional judgments that each of the characters made that has quite sensible outcomes, Lanthimos' looks like the logic that pervades throughout have just been delivered via a spaceship that endured light-years' distance flight.Kudos to the brilliant actors and the technical crew that delivered polished work, all had their share in driving the narrative the writer/director put forth for it to become a resounding triumph. Made me laugh so hard I feel the need to re-watch it again soon. Not to give much away of the story, I will only mention one that's among my favorite scenes, that of one character's delicious rant mimicking North Korean newscasts delivered with much hysterical gusto. I can't help but fall out of my chair on that one. It is such an impressive, inspired work of an ensemble that might just beg for an American language remake because the immediacy of the issues explored might be considered to be a meaty enough for the Hollywood actors to consider sinking their teeth into, that is if the richness of the allusions that are very particular to the Korean identity and consciousness does not work against that thought."
"2080","Parasite",10,"Best movie","This Korean-language movie was such a contrast with the drivel Hollywood churns out. The story was great, the acting was great, and the director maintained tight control throughout. I must see more of Mr. Bong Joon Ho's work."
"2081","Parasite",4,"Just OK for me","After a first screening in a theatre, I couldn't understand the hype around PARASITE. So I watched it a second time at home and once again wasn't impressed at all.
I suppose it's just not my kind of flick, and as I write this review a few months later, I realize that I don't remember much of it, even after seeing it twice.
I have read all the praising comments with a 10/10 note, but couldn't find any of the qualities described, as if people commented another movie."
"2082","Parasite",6,"Not upto the hype","Movie is over rated. Its an average movie. Don't know why it created this much buzz."
"2083","Parasite",1,"Trying to Be Intellectual But Not Succeeding","This movie is trying to say that capitalism is causing both the rich and poor to become parasites - the poor are scam artists lying for money, and the rich are using the poor to nurture their kids. But it's a mess of a story, not a ""masterpiece."" In the real world, the poor definitely have to fight major barriers to get ahead, but this movie doesn't have any depth - the symbolism is amateurish, the characters are one dimensional and inconsistent, and the dialogue between rich and poor is totally unrealistic. The movie makes it seem like the poor are all scamming, bumbling psychopaths, and the rich are all naive and emotionally clueless. Sorry, it's an ignorant view of the world. It makes me realize how disconnected from reality the entertainment industry and its official reviewers have become. Or maybe Hollywood is trying to gain more money and audience share in overseas markets so they promoted this one."
"2084","Parasite",2,"Can't fathom the love for this movie","Don't get the love people have for this movie. It starts as predictable slapstick comedy, then takes a sudden turn into a bloodsport parable on class warfare, and then then finishes -- can you guess? -- Nihilistic irony! Oh, that is really original, isn't it? All of the characters are unlikable, one-dimensional, amoral, lemmings. Apparently, Korean free enterprise economy makes them this way and their personal aspirations, ambitions, and accomplishments are simply results of circumstance and luck, as the wealthy and the poor are equally dimwitted, amoral, and self-interested."
"2085","Parasite",5,"It told A story, nothing about people. That's all about the movie!","A story there was. Thrilling scenes there were. Some pretty cinematography yes. Solid character build-up, hell no. Logical plot, no. Entertainment, not much. Consistency of characters, missing. Petty resentful ignorance towards the rich, yes. Narrow and shallow depiction of the poor, very much.So not convincing. Every stretch of the movie i thought I started understanding the characters a bit more, but no, next stretch would make me scratch that understanding and try to rebuild again.. In the end, it made me fail to attach with any of the characters.Without enough entertainment, what were the film makers trying to tell the audience? I completely don't get it.Really doesn't match the hype. Wasted two hours of my life."
"2086","Parasite",8,"unpredictable, eerie and with original horror plot","Nowadays, the horror movies seem to be just about blood, gores, and fear-inducing trite. Parasite is breaking the mold in this category as well as in the realm of Hollywood. The synopsis won't be needed as you need to see it for yourself, and for your own good. The fact that Hollywood has already adapted its plot and is currently in the works with the help of its director proves its ingenuity."
"2087","Parasite",5,"Its very Normal movie","Not sure why its hyped so much. Its a normal movie, not so great and definately not oscar worthy. Jojo rabbit is far better. I watched it after all the hype and i was dissapointed."
"2088","Parasite",9,"So many twists and turns I got whiplash","I thought I knew what was happening but it turns out I didnt even know what I didnt know.
Cinematography was so well done. Comedy relief at the exact moments it needed it. My stress levels at a max the entire last quarter I had to physically cover my gaping mouth with my hand."
"2089","Parasite",10,"Parasite: a poignant reflection upon inequality - and funny","This film - Parasite - is so good that I set up an IMDB account to write about it. The film is a reflection upon poverty and wealth, an issue that is visible and salient in South Korea where the film is set. It uses humour, likeable characters, and a mischievous pace to draw in the viewer. Like a frog in the proverbial slowly-heating pot, we unwittingly come to consider what it means to be poor, what it means to be rich, and the volatile interface between the two.I began watching the film barracking for the various characters of the poverty-stricken Kim family as they weave themselves into the life of the wealthy Park family. The Kim family son, Ki-woo, pretends to be an English tutor to the Park family's daughter. In turn, Ki-woo draws in his sister, Ki-jung, who pretends to be an art therapist, to work with the traumatised Park family son. The mischief expands like a spider web, as the Kim family father, Ki-taek, and mother, Chung-sook, take further positions within the Park family as their driver and housekeeper. It's a simple premise taken to a ludicrous extreme, making the film both real and not-real.Beneath the light-hearted tone in which the 'parasitic' enmeshment is established, a dark underbelly of resentment reveals itself as the poorer Kim family inhabits the life of the wealthy Park family. As their unlikely success grows, the Kim family shift from a mindset of sporadic life resignations towards the dangerous realm of possibility. The Kim family may actually find a way out of poverty by inhabiting of the Park family house. The second half of the film shifts gear to explore the violence and ruthless deception that is spawned within this up-close-and-personal straddling of absurd extremes of inequality.Parasite calls on its viewers to understand the dynamics of inequality through this fable-istic account of two families, both having their own type of parasitic relation to each other. The Kim family is parasitic on the money of the Park family; the Park family, in turn, is parasitic on the Kim family to do life's chores. With great agility, the film sidesteps the temptation to valorise the poor or demonise the rich. We like all the characters, but there are no heroes. Instead, Parasite invites us to reflect upon inequality in its inglorious everyday forms. The Park family father doesn't like the smell of the Kim family father, while the Park family son inadvertently almost reveals the Kim family ruse by innocently noting that 'they all smell the same.' Poverty and wealth are not abstract categories; they are smells, experienced differently by rich and poor.In this down-to-earth-ness, the filmmaker, Bong Joon-ho, explicitly calls on viewers to interpret the movie on different levels. From the opening scenes, the Kim family son, Ki-woon, repeats the word 'metaphorical.' He is ostensibly talking about a rock that is supposed to bring wealth, but we viewers are left to open up wider horizons of meanings, such as: societies of great inequality must inevitably devolve into transactional-parasitic relations; wealthy families in the midst of poverty must inevitably defend against the social incursions of poorer people doing what they can to survive, as well as defending against the psychological incursions of bad conscience. In every rich household there is something hidden in the basement, as least psychologically.This film holds its line against the temptation to explicitly condemn the evils of inequality. Instead it relentlessly represents the dynamics of inequality, drawing away from the judgement of individual characters, leaving it to viewers to make sense of it. Being vague enough to not spoil the ending, the film's climax portrays violence bubbling up as an expression of long-suppressed resentment. It does so in light of a jarring juxtaposition between the despairing circumstances of the poorer family hitting rock bottom, and the oblivious self-centredness of the rich family who are circumstantially geared by the everyday realities of inequality to not want to know about anything outside their bubble.If the film has a political point, it shifts the debate about inequality. Instead of talking about the 'deserving poor' or the 'greedy rich', the film describes the impoverished social ecosystem of unequal societies, and the social roles and habits these societies require of their people. Violence in the face of absurd levels of inequality does not come from character flaws. But, rather, it emerges as the breaking point of the logics and habits of inequality taken to their logical extreme.An untended pot of boiling water creates scalding steam, and eventually bubbles over."
"2090","Parasite",5,"Not so great","Movie was recommended by friend, who lauded it how many rewards it had gotten, so we watched this with high expectations. Despite the movie calling itself comedy there were only a few places in between that were relatively funny. And therein lies the problem, the movie was undecided which genre it wants to be, drama, comedy, horror, action? The story depends on plot twists to keep it going, some are predictable some are unexpected, and some are outright stupid. I'm talking about the finale, it just looks out of nowhere and forced so the viewers don't end up with a lackluster ending. It's a bizarre flick, but in no way great. I'd give it a slightly higher rating but there's a need for counter-balance to all the reviews overrating this movie."
"2091","Parasite",8,"One Parasite you shouldn't avoid","SYNOPSIS:
A poor family in South Korea con their way into the home of the wealthy. They soon find themselves in the middle of a dark, unexpected secret.REVIEW:
This film is truly an original masterpiece. From Bong Joon Ho's direction to all of the phenomenal acting. So intricate and precise it left a really special film.
POSITIVES:
As I mentioned, the directing is absolutely superb. Bong Joon Ho really has this immersive directing style that get you to lose yourself within the film. You feel as though your living through what the characters are living through. The acting is Oscar worthy all around. Kang-ho Song, Sun-kyun Lee, Yeo-jeong Jo, Woo-sik Choi, So-dam Park and everyone else had unbelievable chemistry together. The big stand outs to me were definitely Kang-ho and Yeo-jeong. I feel those were the two captains of storytelling for their respective families and it was nothing short of amazing. Whether it was the build up for Kim Ki-taek (Kang-ho Song) to what ultimate happens in the end or the absolute unwarranted trust and obliviousness of Park Yeon-kyo (Yeo-jeong Jo). You really get a feel of the difference in class and how a family struggles through poverty in order to make a life for themselves and how the rich use their money to mask their own ignorance.
NEGATIVES:
Its tough for me to come up with any negatives. This is one of those films where I don't see very much wrong at all, however, it's a film I couldn't see myself rewatching more than twice. Not that it's a bad film or too heavy subject matter, it's just not one of those films I gravitate towards for multiple viewings and that's why I don't have it as a perfect 10/10.
CONCLUSION:
This is one of those films I definitely encourage everyone to see at least once. It's so original and so well told that I know this is a film people will go back to and talk about the significance this film has on cinema. It will be taught in classes and will be a timeless film. Superb all around from cinematography to editing. This is a great film to get those opposed to foreign films on the boat. 8.9/10."
"2092","Parasite",10,"No wonder this gem got almost 10 mins standing ovation at Cannes.","Oh man, what can I say...
How do I describe this jaw-dropping masterpiece in just few sentences?PARASITE (not mistaken with that outstanding anime 'Parasyte') is a socially conscious themed film that masterfully wrapped in comedy and thriller. It's an exciting and surprising ride from start to finish. The tone shifting in the second part of the film is done brilliantly. Eventhough there's so much stuff happening, Bong didn't lose control of his storytelling.Most of the scenes are sure very relatable for many in real life. On top of that, the ensemble cast (featuring my favorite Song Kang Ho) deliver a top notch Oscar-worthy performance.PARASITE is the worthy winner of this year Palme d'Or (and I also hope it will do well at the Oscar - Best Picture worthy? for sure!)It's the best film of the year, one of the best I've seen in this decade and for me it's arguably one of all time classic."
"2093","Parasite",NA,"Long, with inconsistent characters and no moral compass","This had the makings of a fun farce. As I watched the first hour or so, I thought it could be a madcap Hollywood comedy. Implausible, yes, but amusing in an absurd way.But then it started to go in weird places. Some will call it social satire, but to me it was just dark, amoral and incoherent.The protagonists (the family of scammers) are profoundly unsympathetic. They wreck the lives of everyone they come into contact with, and some of their victims are just fellow struggling domestic workers. Yet the film-maker seems to see them as the downtrodden heroes of the film!Their story also makes no sense. When we meet them, they are solvenly, helpless, inept and unemployed. In the opening scenes, they are scolded for doing a simple job badly-assembling pizza boxes. But then suddenly they become master con artists, taking over all aspects of the lives and household of a wealthy family, running everything with efficiency and aplomb. This is just bad writing, not a masterpiece.While their employers were absurdly naive, I didn't hate them as much as the director seemed to want me to. Yes, they are silly, but they are also hardworking and accomplished, they love their kids, and in almost every way, they are morally superior to the people preying upon them. In the director's upside-down world view, their wealth and comfort makes them deserving of whatever happens to them. The fates of the employers and their original employees don't seem consistent with any sort of moral compass.Without spoilers, all I can say is that the climax and ending of the movie are unsupported by what precedes them, not just in a moral sense but also in terms of the characters' previous behavior. If the writer of this film had expressed the message of the film as a simple essay, unadorned with acting and cinematography, it would be dismissed as a childish and unintelligent mess.I would not recommend this so-called masterpiece, though I do think a other director with a lighter touch could remake it into something more coherent."
"2094","Parasite",2,"Overrated","Why this won best picture I will never know. The translation was horrible. Plot filled with holes, and so so acting."
"2095","Parasite",10,"Food for thought delivered with exciting wit","Parasite is the best movie of the year. This Korean movie won the renowned Palme d'Or of the 2019 Cannes Film Festival. It has been selected as the South Korean entry for Best International Feature Film at the ninety-second Academy Awards.This movie combines multiple genres such as comedy, drama, horror, thriller and tragedy. The main theme is the clash between rich and poor in the Republic of Korea. This conflict has been the main topic in other great films such as The Housemaid and The Taste of Money. Parasite however is less cumbersome, melodramatic and moralizing and convinces with wit, depth and creativity instead.International audiences might feel slightly confused by this unusual genre mixture at first contact but this is exactly what makes this movie so unique. The story starts in a dramatic way and portrays a poor family who lives in a small semi-basement apartment and struggles to make ends meet. The movie gets more comedic when the son of said family gets the unexpected opportunity to replace a friend as English tutor for the beautiful daughter of a wealthy family. The film turns into a thriller when the four family members gradually infiltrate and even replace the personnel of the wealthy family with ethically questionable procedures. The movie turns into a horror film when the family realizes that the family mansion hides a creepy secret as things gradually spin out of control. The film ends as an almost surreal tragedy that will leave the audience speechless. Parasite is a movie the leaves a lasting impression, offers much food for thought and should animate philosophical discussions. The movie is so detailed, precise and profound that it deserves to be purchased to be watched time and again.I'm grateful that I had the opportunity to watch this movie in French in a Canadian cinema and so were the numerous other members of the audience in the packed movie theatre. People are craving for a change and are tired of tame, predictable and repetitive Hollywood superhero prequels, remakes and sequels. There should be more creative, dynamic and entertaining international movies like Parasite in movie theatres all around the world. If you desire to make a statement in favour of cinema as an artistic expression rather than shallow entertainment, do yourself a favour and enjoy this incredible movie on the big screen. This movie has the potential to become a cult classic and deserves all the praise it gets."
"2096","Parasite",10,"Best Film of the year <U+0001F44F>","It took me while to be able to sit and review this movie. It has been difficult, almost impossible to put down into words anything about it. I truly lacked the right words and was even afraid not to be true to its core.
Here's a film which leaves no one indifferent. It is certainly metaphorical in every aspect: the water that is both a blessing or a catatrophe depending on which side of the social pyramid one stands; the smell inpregnated in old people's clothes which both disgusts and arouses the rich couple; the large window in their house in comparison to the poor family 's basement window.
The question starts with a simple title:""Parasite"". Who are they? The ones in the basement, at the bottom of the pyramid? The ones in the middle trying to strive, even if they cannot get rid of the smell? The ones on top of that pyramid who pretend to accept others yet lack total RESPECT?
Or aren't WE all parasites somehow and loose perspective so often? Wasn't a camera leading our eyes all the time?
For the first time in my life I had a feeling of real movement while watching a film. Sometimes I was moving left, right, up or down. Sometimes I was watching. Others I was being watched. The window could be either a screen to the outside world, inside the house. I often felt watched in the movie theatre
Was I the parasite?
If this isn't the Best Film of the year, I don't know what it us.<U+0001F44F><U+0001F44F><U+0001F44F>"
"2097","Parasite",10,"This is why the rating scale goes all the way to 10","Glad I managed to watch Parasite just before the Oscars. A most deserving winner, especially in Original Screenplay and Best Picture categories.Only 10/10 I have given to a film, out of nearly 100 reviews.I am not sure what genre Parasite is. I laughed, stood in the edge of my seat and got emotional all throughout a very compelling 2 hours and 20mins run time.Parasite is a brilliant story about a poor family living in Seoul who tries to entrench themselves as workers in the house of the super wealthy Parks.The contrasts between two lifestyles are beautifully portrayed and yet, unlike most movies, the rich ones are not made out to be jackasses or bad apples. They are merely a family. Certainly different, flawed, but not one you will actively root against.The script is one of the most engaging I have ever seen. Builds at a perfect pace with the story and yet is positively full of suspense.The acting is incredibly convincing, especially the poor family's patriarch Kim Ki-taek, who goes through a very wide range of emotions.I have trouble pinpointing what else makes it so great, but the film flew by for me. I loved every bit of it.Bong Joon-Ho created a masterpiece a very worthy recipient of the first Best Picture academy award for a non-English language film.
It will certain open many others for others to follow him.A must watch.PS: the only movie that Parasite remotely reminded me off is Hirokazu Koreeda's Shoplifters (2018)"
"2098","Parasite",10,"Parasite","I have a feeling I won't see a movie this good or affecting for a long time. Funny and scary and thrilling and sad"
"2099","Parasite",10,"Stinging topicality and gut-wrenching violence, it's explosive filmmaking on every level.","""Parasite"" Review
(10/10)Snowpiercer director Bong Joon-ho has made a South Korean social satire that's also a genre-bending Palme d'Or-winning thriller of class struggle.
It's best to go into ""Parasite,"" the Cannes Film Festival grand-prize winner by Korean filmmaker Bong Joon-ho, not knowing too much about what you're about to see; the better to let its sly power sneak up on you. A dark satire of the class divide in contemporary South Korea, it's the story of two families of four. You'll watch knowing you're in the hands of a master filmmaker; only wondering when it's over how certain effects were achieved (a sequence near the end is a wonder), and losing yourself in these characters: particularly the gentle, wide-eyed anxiety of Mrs. Park and the way that Ki-woo's father, a man who cheerfully recites his string of failed businesses, remains determined to somehow find a way to make his family prosperous again.
The title metaphor becomes abundantly clear, is filled with vivid conversations that remind us how the Parks can't imagine (or don't care to imagine) how the other half lives. In one scene, they coolly discuss how poor people smell; like an old radish, says Mr. Park, or a rag that's been boiled. Ki-woo's family, however, seems to understand the rich all too well. What keeps you rapt in Parasite is the visual wit, every shot distills the movie's themes, and the richness of the characters and performances: Song's stricken expression as Kim Sr. is driven to murder by class resentment, Lee Jeong-eun's swift transformation from a calmly efficient housekeeper to a keening madwoman, and Choi's eloquent helplessness as his teenage protagonist watches this new world order gorily combust.
At the heart of Parasite is the most gnawing evolutionary fear of all, the inability to protect one's family. Parents work to save their children but lose them, as children lose their parents and wives their husbands. The bonds are firm but can withstand only so much pressure before they fracture. Who are the real parasites? The poor who attach themselves to the rich or the rich who suck the marrow of the poor?
The movie dissects the universal gap between the haves and the have-nots with shocking wit, stinging topicality and gut-wrenching violence. It's explosive filmmaking on every level."
"2100","Parasite",8,"Very interesting plot!","Great! Awesome! Very interesting plot! I think it is one of the best thriller of 2019! I'm not a fan of Korean films, but this is great movie! I hope it win one or few Oscars!"
"2101","Parasite",3,"A Titanic achievement","Richly appointed, a glitterati champagne Cannes launch to an inebriated fanfare of stratospheric expectation, then unexpectedly in mid-journey an iceberg crash, an unsettling sinking feeling, followed by an agonizingly slow cascade into drowning horror.
Compared to another mediocre superhero movie it might rank favourably, but a far cry from Tati or Hitchcock. Closer to a stylish 70s exploitation film."
"2102","Parasite",10,"Parasite (Gisaengchung)","Stunning screenplay and wonderful acting by the whole team members. Director took the story to the next leave of film. The ending and the start of the story is obviously awesome. Thanks I enjoyed this Movie and loved it . The best Korean Film I have ever watched in this decade."
"2103","Parasite",8,"AVOID ALL SPOILERS AT ALL COSTS!!","So happy i managed to see this movie with NO IDEA what was to come, though the trailers were a strong indication of what was to come. I wish i didn't have to rely on subtitles, knowing there are many subtleties you miss with limited translation.
Ater some time for reflection, this movie reminds me of 'shoplifters,' another excellent movie that reflects on unconventional familial love."
"2104","Parasite",8,"You gotta watch it.","The only reason I'm giving it a 8 it's because I wouldn't watch it again.
Gave me so many emotions, it was a whole rollercoaster. I felt anxious, worried, sad, and even happy at some point.
Made me feel fear at so many scenes, it really plays with your mind.Masterpiece? Yes.
Would I watch it again? Heck no."
"2105","Parasite",NA,"Just read...","Parasite is a unique movie. I don't know if it's a true masterpiece, or one of a kind (indeed), or just a piece of masterful craft. Bong does everything he wants while telling his stories, and he's the only one I know who can do that aside from Tarantino. The plus here is a very sound moral. I will think a lot about Parasite, and maybe watch it again. This is the first time in 100+ reviews that I don't feel I can correctly rate a movie, but surely it is in the 8 to 10 stars range."
"2106","Parasite",8,"Parasite is nail-biting and intense thriller that is going to give you goose bumps","The Oscar fever has started and it is my favourite time of the year where I get to watch the films which is engaging, clap-worthy, entertaining and relatable.
Parasite was already in buzz for sometime which caught my attention and to my surprise turned out to better than expected after seeing it.Parasite tells the story of differences in the mindset between the Upper class and Lower class families which is very much existing in our society.
As the name of the film itself, the movie gives a detailed account of how an unemployed family is influenced by the lifestyle of a wealthy rich family and eventually enters into their house
only to get the shock of their life.Directed by Bong Joon Ho, who made Snowpiercer and Okja, Parasite boast off characters which you can easily relate to. A poverty driven family comprising of
a struggling father, Kim, and mother, tech savvy son and a careless sister - who goes the wrong path to enter the house of a rich family but ultimately face the consequences.
The film slowly and eventually picks up as each member from the poor family starts getting the job in the house of rich, by falsely accusing the old staffs. The main
drama unfolds when the rich guys go for a vacation and the Kim's family take over the house and celebrate their win. However, they meet with an unfortunate incident when one of the
old staff comes back which changes their plan completely. This is where the film kicks-off when the rich guys cut short their trip and plan to come back which leads
to series of uninvited events, leading to more excitement and thrills you never expected.If you go the wrong way, you have to face the consequence and that is what the director Bong Joon Ho showed in his film when Kim's loses one of his family member
and ultimately face the redemption. Hats of to Bong Joon Ho for creating a beautiful drama with relatable characters, humorous situations and a powerful storyline with a strong message.
There are couple of scenes which is executed brilliantly - when two staff families meet at the basement, the flood scene depicting the behavior of Kim's family - Kim picking
up in stuff, son grabbing his favourite stone and daughter lighting her cigeratte even though the house is in mess. The beauty of cinema lies in the story-telling
and this is where Parasite scores.Technically, Parasite has a wonderful background score with lovely cinematography. Editing is superb, though I felt few scenes could have been trimmed. Art direction
is brilliant while dialogues are outstanding. Performances wise - I felt all the actors played their part while but if I had to pick up, my favourite would be
Kang-ho Song, who plays the role of father of the unemployed family.Parasite is nail-biting and intense thriller that is going to give you goose bumps. Brilliant 4/5"
"2107","Parasite",5,"totally overrated","Good but definitely not worth an Oscar for best movie or best director."
"2108","Parasite",9,"BEST PICTURE goes to PARASITE","I watched this movie (before Oscars) and I know this movie will get awards for sure! And I just came to know that this movie got BEST PICTURE on Academy Awards! WELL DESERVED!Parasite created a history in Academy Awards!
A MUST WATCH!"
"2109","Parasite",5,"Sadly I felt it was overrated.","After watching this ""masterpiece"", I felt as if there was missing something, or a major twist was left out.
I was told by plenty of people, that you would be amazed about the twists, and there would be a lot of surprises. Which sadly didn't happen, and I really felt that it was missing that huge ""WHAT!?"" feel, which never came.
Everything was so predictable, and there wasn't as much comedy as expected.
I wouldn't see it again, but I'm good now that I have seen it tho."
"2110","Parasite",9,"Parasite (2019)","Director Bong Joon-ho's global sensation, Parasite, is an allegorical tale of class warfare. Before watching the film, I was familiar with its high praise but knew little of its actual plot. If possible, I'd recommend other viewers similarly go into this one as cold as they can. While Parasite deals with heavy themes (economic mobility, climate change), it does so in ways that are constantly entertaining and surprising. A unique blend of drama, suspense, comedy, and horror, Parasite provides further proof that cinema is a truly universal language."
"2111","Parasite",10,"Absolute Brilliance","It isn't every day that you come across a movie like this, a practically flawless one in my opinion actually. I have nothing but praise for director Bong Joon-Ho and I can now see why this movie has received much hype and praise over the past few months. This is a movie which not only shows a contrast between the rich and the poor but also the human condition and the will to survive. Don't worry, this review won't have any spoilers whatsoever.To begin this praise train I have to first and foremost praise the acting of lead actor Choi Woo-shik whom delivered an incredible performance throughout this movie and brings a sort of charm during the first act of the movie.Another standout would be Kang-Ho Song that remains a recurring cast in the movies directed by Bong Joon-Ho and his consistency in the various movies he has directed absolutely shows why the director has so much trust in his acting capabilities.A transition scene in particular which occurs at the end of the second act is really a beauty in itself and the transitions were absolutely stunning and beautiful which brings me to the cinematography and movie editing of the movie. The pacing was consistently on point where everything, even the change in tone is seamless. Along with the cinematography in which this movie is beautifully shot from the aesthetically pleasing rich kid house down to the semi-basement house in the suburbs.Furthermore, another beauty of this movie will definitely be the score which was composed by Jung Jae-il which manages to convey emotion and tension during the second and third act of the movie which is something truly remarkable. Through music there are also hints to the sudden sort of change in tone I shall say which begins within just about the middle of the second act of the movie.The plot of this movie is something I've yet to see over the many years of watching movies and this is where praised should be absolutely given for this ambitious plot where I could simply say, nothing written and the direction of this movie which keeps you guessing as to what this movie really is about should you dive deeper than the way the movie was promoted within the trailers shown for it. It is nothing short of extraordinary as you are unable to really see the change in tone coming.At the end of the day, this movie questions how the rich could help the poor and in fact portrays mankind's strive for survival which in this case would be a better life in such a way that it isn't in your face. Plus, by the end of the movie, you really realise there is no real protagonist or antagonist, just people. People trying to live a happier life.Thus, making Parasite the perfect movie where I am unable to criticise a single thing in this movie. Director Bong Joon-Ho has definitely earned my trust in his artwork and should to some extent be placed amongst the greats."
"2112","Parasite",10,"Any Explanation Would Be a Spoiler--That's How Good This Is","This movie starts off with a seemingly predictable start, a poor kid pretends to be a college student in order to be an English tutor for a rich girl. But what unravels is an extraordinary story of power, greed, insanity, manipulation, and false appearances. It's a slow rise to disconcerting, uncomfortable, and then all of the sudden, it is disturbing and gory and... insane. There is no way to see what's coming next, I promise you that. This--THIS is a TRUE thriller. Highly recommend. The ending leaves questions unanswered, but many opportunities to philosophize on the condition of humanity."
"2113","Parasite",9,"What a good movie looks like","This movie is clever on so many levels, the acting is impeccable, the story-line unexpected and the directing flawless but I don't want to give too much away, just watch it. In this era of super heroes and sequels, this is a breath of fresh air and a sign that there's still hope for the craft."
"2114","Parasite",10,"Mixed Genre","If you're looking for a comedy, brutal, dark and drama movie,this is the movie for you. The way they switched from one genre to another is so smooth you'll enjoy every bit of minute watching it. The whole story line is great. <U+0001F601>"
"2115","Parasite",5,"one of those films that makes you wonder how the could mess it up","Parasite is itself a parasite of a movie. The start is interesting and the cinematography is excellent throughout the film. It's a lot of fun seeing the street life of this poor family and their living conditions. There are some very unlikely manuplations involving job positions which are all too quickly accomplished and never entirely believable in their successful execution.
What kills this film is the ridiculous second half of the movie and ending.
This is
It makes you wonder if they had a new writer finish the story up. One who just wanted to create an ending and had no concept of how to do it.
Because there was some good acting and great film work, I gave it five stars. But it probably rates less due to bizaare and impossibly stupid parts to the movie."
"2116","Parasite",10,"Movie of the year","The best movie of 2019 has everything: great acting, fabulous screenplay, with funny, tense and plot-twist moments, excelent directing, social critics and acid jokes. A monumental (but easy-to-consume) piece of art that satisfies all audience's tastes. Highly recommended."
"2117","Parasite",9,"Multilayered portrayal of the real Korea","This is a movie about a class struggle in South Korea, like what movie ""Us"" attempts to do but done properly. It is a stark reminder of what true living standards for most South Koreans look like, and its realism is very painful. Few are aware of the fact that up to the 1980s, South Korea was in fact more impoverished than North Korea, and it was only late that the situation reversed with famines of the 90s etc, but many people still live miserable lives, and situation is very similar to that in China, where a few got gloriously rich but the urban masses still live in bug infested cheap dwellings.Some crafty members of this underclass manage to con contemptuous rich man into employing them as his servants. For many Asians smell is a way to express utter contempt, and this is often directed against the white people, who, being able to process milk, smell ""like butter"" and are seen in rac ist light as unclean, but the same rac ist contempt is directed towards the poor. The poor accept these valuations and fight for the crumbles, like roaches in the dark, but in life and death situations, resentment might boil up and the contempt might cost the rich their empty heads.The movie paints a sad picture of modern East Asian societies, with many subtle points, criticizes their culture and emulation of the America, with a few cruel but precise strokes. The sheer talent of the Korean filmmaker, but also the fact that West likes movies from foreign countries that are self bashing, allowing the worst condescension rooted in colonialism that failed miserably in East Asia to thrive, one more reason to cheer this slightly overrated movie."
"2118","Parasite",10,"Brilliant and one of those very few films truly deserving 10 stars...","I absolutely loved this film. I thought it was sad, darkly funny, discomfiting, and absolutely brilliant. It's hard to talk about the script and its astute observations about class and equality without giving too much away, but oh my, so many stairways so leaden with meaning. If you aren't into foreign movies because of the subtitles, I'd still highly recommend seeing this. He is such a master of image and setting that it conveys as much as the dialogue. I've got ""Snowpiercer"" lined up to watch tomorrow for a full-on Bong Joon-ho weekend."
"2119","Parasite",8,"A fantastic film. See it before the inevitable bad American remake.","Looks like a few people failed to grasp the films message. It's a more cerebral watch than their intellect can handle. Ha ha.A dark dramatic black comedy film with a strong social commentary.Hugely enjoyable and well deserving of its many accolades.See it now before Hollywood tries to remake it and ruins its excellence.
A fabulous director."
"2120","Parasite",9,"Pleasantly disturbing","Watched on a flight after the Oscars. Curious.
It starts slow, there are subtitles, but you are quickly adapted to the the films rhythym. I know nothing of this culture but it is a story of humans The loyalty and love we share in our family. Choices are made, levers tripped, situations develop...
Both families are endearing. There are some light and humorous scenes. There are also a few 'oh come on' risks akin to a sitcom, but that's how we get from there to 'holy crap what is happening here' so must take that leap with the director.
The cinematography is beautiful, the pace is good but you need to pay attention. the dialogue is all valuable-
When we get to the last third, it all comes together quickly. Enjoy the ride.
You haven't seen a film like this before"
"2121","Parasite",10,"The best movie of the year!","I find a lot of korean movies slow and unsatisfying but this one wasn't any of these things, neither did it have that annoying american touch, but this movie will suprise you in ways you would never expect!"
"2122","Parasite",10,"Simply mesmerising","This film had me hooked from the beginning. A fast-paced, and well thought out storyline. No details were left unanswered in my eyes. Brilliant and humble acting from all the cast with believable characteristics and flaws. The subtitles throughout are worth it for what is unveiled during the film."
"2123","Parasite",10,"Amazing!","I never write reviews but this film was a masterpiece! Definitely one of my favorite movies now. Go watch it, you won't regret it!"
"2124","Parasite",9,"ACT LIKE YOU OWN THE PLACE.","You'll watch knowing you're in the hands of a master filmmaker"
"2125","Parasite",9,"Exceptional piece on class, culture, and family.","Watching a movie in another language sometimes creates a barrier, but great film making and writing can instead, turn that into a bridge, and such is one of Parasite's strengths. I never felt out of touch with what was going on because I didn't understand that culture or anything along those lines, and that's why I highly recommend this movie to anyone.
Parasite also has many outstanding shots and high level filmmaking in general. Visuals never dissapoint.
The movie is so well paced and gets pretty wild toward the end without being ridiculous. The twists and turns it made were one of the most entertaining Ive seen in a while. There isn't much else to disect. Just go watch it."
"2126","Parasite",10,"One of the best, if not the best movie of the year","I was looking forward to this movie all year, since i didn't like Roma (the international film front-runner and winner of 2018) as much as others did. This might just be the best foreign language film I have ever seen, with Portrait of a Lady on Fire (my personal favourite movie of the year) being one of the runner-ups.This film was a transcendent cinematic experience for me, as Bong Joon Ho, the director of the movie makes it seem like its a walk in the park to go through the different genres in film. Movies are my favorite form of art and Parasite is just that: The Definition of Art. Lets go #Bonghive <U+0001F36F>"
"2127","Parasite",9,"Must Watch","I had no expectations walking into Parasite, but now my love and appreciation for it has breached the stratosphere. This is definitely one of the best movies of 2019, and it's bound to be a classic.It's directed by Bong Joon-ho, he did Snowpiercer (2013) and Okja (2017), and now he's back with Parasite and it is fantastic. From a directing standpoint, this movie is gorgeous. The cinematography is extremely well done. It's just stunning and so metaphorical. There are also sequences in this movie that will shake you and leave you on the edge of your seat.My favourite aspect is the narrative. I love the concept that Parasite is built on and what it explores throughout the movie, with the conflict and contrast between upper and lower cIasses of society. It was just beautiful to watch it play out, with its prevalence within the lives of all the characters, along with how they overcome their difficulties and how they evolve with their circumstances.The characters and performances themselves are also amazing. The entire cast is just perfect in each of their roles and I really hope they get some recognition from the Academy. I don't think many people mentioned the character arcs but I thought that was really well constructed too.The score and sound design by Jeong Jae-il was also perfect in every scenario. It brings scenes from 100 to 1000 and emphasises each tone, emotion and atmosphere.In regards to flaws, I don't think there are any major ones with Parasite. There is one decision made in the third act that I felt could've been better explored to support it. But still it didn't really bother me.Parasite is probably my favourite movie of 2019. It's funny, thrilling, emotional, satirical and hauntingly true. It's delivers everything that makes a movie perfect and shakes you to your core."
"2128","Parasite",9,"Shocking!","My first ever Korean film and the film lives to its expectation after seeing the movie trailer. It was mixed of comedy, suspense and even horror, go see it you'll be suprised!"
"2129","Parasite",10,"Great story great acting great film...end of!","Just watch the damn movie its awesome...hollywood has had its ass kicked...story is so original"
"2130","Parasite",7,"good movie","Beautiful movie congratulations. story beautiful movie"
"2131","Parasite",9,"What's the real grift","This film is always one step ahead of its audience. You are so in tune with the protagonists that by the time they are neck deep into their futile grift, the question of who's right or who's wrong isn't so much as being poised by the master director Bong Joon-ho; it's being slammed over your head with a rock. And when you recover, and the audience claps, the answer still isn't clear.Parasite is deserving of all the massive praise it has received. That I saw this in a packed theater with an adoring, fully rapt crowd truly warmed my heart. It's cinema at its best.As many folks are noting, and I will reiterate: go into this cold! Read as little about it as possible if you can. It will make the experience so much better. This is one I know I will be revisiting often over the years. Enjoy it."
"2132","Parasite",9,"Sadistic comedy and brilliant tragedy all bundled up into the best film of 2019.","There I said it---It's the best film of the year for this reviewer, and it's the best film Bong Jong-ho has made to date.But to be fair, I've yet to see ""The Irishman,"" ""1917,"" and ""A Hidden Life,"" so my opinion could change. Though, I can't see that being likely.The originalness of ""Parasite"" is what sets it apart. ""Parasite,"" twists and turns to darker and darker places while still maintaining a comedic tone. There's ingenious visual cinematography and storytelling when it portrays the division of class between the wealthy and poor.Class inequality is a theme director Bong Joon-ho frequently uses. You observe it in his other films, ""Snowpiercer,"" ""Okja,"" and even in the first film I ever saw of his back in 2006 with Joon-ho's horror film, ""The Host."" Which also starred Kang-ho Song who plays, Kevin's father in ""Parasite."" He's hilariously witty in both films.""Parasite"" set in South Korea, is about a young man from an impoverished family, the Kims, who winds up with a job to tutor a high school girl from an extremely affluent family, the Parks. He changes his name from Kim Ki-woo to Kevin to impersonate an English tutor. He soon realizes this could be a way to get his whole family employment under the Parks, and the family makes it their plan to do-so.The film shined when it cinematically showed the differences between class equality among these two very different families. When we see the wealthy Park family, the house is pristinely clean. A complete contrast to the Kim family apartment, which is a basement apartment littered with trash and infested by stink bugs, in what looks to be one of the poorest sections of the city.If you like dark comedies, then you're sure to enjoy ""Parasite."" I've witnessed people who don't like foreign films because of subtitle-hatred still relish this film.You won't see another movie like ""Parasite,"" perhaps ever. Well done, Bong Joon-ho."
"2133","Parasite",10,"Beautifully Powerful","Thoroughly enjoyed this movie. Great acting, wonderfully written screenplay, artist style and cinematography. Too much to talk about, just WATCH this movie."
"2134","Parasite",9,"Simple yet realistic","This is undoubtedly one of the best movies of the year and I think the best work of Bong Joon Ho yet. It's a very funny and playful movie. You can't pin it down into one specific genre, much like Bong Joon Ho's other work. Some moments are absurdly funny while others are intense.
The premise is about a poor family who lives in a small basement apartment and struggling in their everyday life. One day one of their family members gets a chance to work as an English tutor for the daughter of a wealthy family. The poor family sees this as an opportunity to scam this wealthy family and they find a way to all work for them. Things get more serious after the first half because some stuff happens and the poor family has to deal with it cautiously.
What is amazing about this movie is the story is simple and realistic, but told in such a fresh and unique way that it feels relatable and larger than life. The director shows the irony of life. How two separate classes of people in a society perceive things differently.
While watching the movie, it was so engaging that I felt like it was controlling me with its beautiful cinematography and well structured plot."
"2135","Parasite",10,"UNLIKE EVERYTHING YOU'VE EVER SEEN","Parasite is such a fantastic movie that even its comparison with other amazing works can be dangerous. Korean director Bong Joon-ho has such control over the narrative and the camera that we often feel in a Hitchcock or Tarantino movie or even Italian neorealism. And it all flows smoothly.The film begins as a custom comedy. Kim Ki-woo's family (Choi Woo-sik) lives so far below the poverty line in Korean society, that resides in a basement. They're always trying to capture wifi signals from surface neighbors, or leaving the windows open to benefit from the plagues fumigation made by the city hall on the streets.The boy's life experiences a turnaround when a friend who is taking a trip abroad indicates him as a tutor to a girl he is teaching English. The friend is in love with the girl and trusts Kim, who knows why, to keep her safe.Changing his name to Kevin, the boy begins his classes at the magnificent home of the fancy family, and, as expected, the girl Park Da-hye (Jung Ziso) soon falls in love with him. But your dream is much more ambitious: getting a job for your whole family in the house.First, he convinces the girl's mother Yeon-kyo (Jo Yeo-jeong in great acting) to hire an art psychologist named Jessica, actually her sister Ki-jung (Park So-dam) for the hyperactive younger son. Using tricks, the Kim family's father and mother are soon admitted to the house. And on a Parks trip, they celebrate at their ""new"" residence.After that apparent happy ending, everything changes in the movie. Former housekeeper Moon-gwang (Jeong-eun Lee) returns home and brings with her a great secret hidden until then. The outbreak of this surprise causes scenes worthy of a thriller, which only ends with the unexpected return of the Parks. What follows are comical scenes and amenities, until the terrible birthday of little boy Da-son (Hyun-jun Jung).From there, chaos, destruction, and despair. And an ending. Or would it be two?"
"2136","Parasite",10,"Two discussion questions I enjoy","Rather than review, I like to add two cents to the conversations.One individual comments that she never rides the subway. What is the significance of the below ground/above the surface boundary? Which domain affords the better social perspective?And is anyone in this story not parasitic? Hardly anyone that I can identify."
"2137","Parasite",10,"Fabulous film","Ranks as one of the best films I have ever seen and I've seen many .Very clever , unusual story it's about as original as a film can be , it totally lacked the predictability of most US films.Don't miss it"
"2138","Parasite",10,"On Point!","I'm going to put it simply: There's not a single thing this film does wrong.The comedy is on point. The drama is on point. The moments of tension are on point. The commentary on social class is on point. Acting, writing, filmmaking - on point.Parasite totally deserved the Palme D'Or and I want this to win all the Oscars, all the Golden Globes, and any other awards it gets nominated for because everything in this s**t was incredibly on point.Parasite is nothing short of a MASTERPIECE."
"2139","Parasite",10,"Just a perfectly done movie, in every way.","It's a perfect movie in every way, words can't even decribe this satisfying feeling I got right now after I've seen it. It's an emotional rollercoaster that everybody need to experience. I can't even begin to describe it. Just watch it."
"2140","Parasite",10,"Magnificent thrilling and unexpected story","The plots are refreshing and thrilling and the movie itself has one of the best paces I recently experienced in a movie.It was best described rollercoast slow ascendts and quik descents. I loved it!"
"2141","Parasite",10,"Master's Flavor","High-quality toy tent which does not get wet with rain, and odd contrast of furniture which does not get wet by rain"
"2142","Parasite",9,"Make any plan is an all-time joke.","The film is a contemporary cinamatic adaptation of the Sisyphus myth. You will even find the stone, symbolically appearing at many scenes."
"2143","Parasite",10,"PARASITE: OUTSTANDING.","PROS:EVERY SINGLE THING.The acting is great. The pacing is amazing, it always feels like something is happening and you won't get bored. The message isn't scream out at the audience, you need to read between the lines.
The characters are well developed, there's no hero or villain. You can empathize with every character and understand why they do what they do. There are violence, comedy, action, suspense and romance. Honestly, I wasn't expecting much, and I find myself really.CONS:Not for me, but some people may find the ending really weird and unsatisfying. But read some reviews and probably you would understand what's the message behind the ending."
"2144","Parasite",10,"Another Korean masterpiece","Bong Joon-Ho did it again. A true masterpiece in acting and storytelling. You are hooked until the end of the story. Then you'll spend at least an hour after the credits thinking about it !
Avoid spoilers"
"2145","Parasite",10,"Just when you think you've seen it all, a movie comes along to shatter all your beliefs.","Parasite is a true work of art and a rare and extraordinary masterpiece that should be viewed by all, especially film lovers. If you're planning to watch this movie avoid spoilers at all costs. It will have you conflicted on who you are rooting for. Parasite taps into the tensions caused by the widening gap between the rich and poor around the world. It's a darkly, entertaining and suspenseful look at a poor but incredibly cunning family and the rich Park family, their polar opposites. The film makes you play a guessing game on which of the two families are more rotten. Parasite shows the extent to which we go to in order to live a comfortable life. It's best to go into the movie not knowing too much about what you're about to see, and let it's sly power sneak up on you. Who are the real parasites? The poor who attach themselves to the rich or the rich that suck the marrow of the poor."
"2146","After",2,"Disappointing","Two people meet in college, fall in love very fast and then for the rest of the movie you watch them making out. The ""plot twist"" isn't even a twist. The book(s) are incredibly gripping, I don't understand why they had to tone the plot down this much. The movie should have been 18+, it feels like it's 12-."
"2147","After",1,"Save your money for something worth!","I went to see this film with my hopes high since I have read the books multiple times and I absolutely loved them.
Well, I got really disappointed. If you have read the books, you're going to be really disappointed as well. If you haven't, you will not understand the story, since the action is overall really quick, so you don't really understand the scenes or why they are even there. It is boring because 90% of the film nothing much different happens, most of the times is just music playing and Tessa and Hardin kissing and making out. The dialogues are weak, they barely even talk, and if they do, is just hi and how are you. Basically, the characters met and 5 seconds later are already declaring eternal love. No sense at all. The storyline is poor and doesn't respect the film at all. For me, the film killed the book.
I feel like the characters didn't show much emotion. Hardin I just didn't feel the vibe. He is really superficial and his personality is just neutral.PLEASE GO SAVE YOUR MONEY AND GO WATCH SOMETHING BETTER"
"2148","After",1,"Awful. They owe the author an apology.","Clearly NO ONE involved in this movie read the books! The only thing they got right was the characters names! That's it. It was a completely different story than the book. There was absolutely no chemistry between the characters. I've seen more passion in a Hallmark movie. Seriously, don't waste your money or time."
"2149","After",1,"Cliché, boring, bad plot, predictable.","We died laughing in the cinema, because it was so ridiculousy predictable and stupid. Don't spend your money or time. I am telling you, no!"
"2150","After",3,"Disappointed","So I´ve read the books. I found them very good despite being ""teenage romance"", because of the complexity of the characters (especially Hardin), the roller-coaster storyline and how you get so sucked into it and feel everything the characters feel. You can actually truly feel how Tessa and Hardin are soulmates.The movie though...
I totally get that they had to cram everything together and leave stuff out which most of the time when I have read a book and then watched the movie annoys me but still leaved me satisfied. But with this I was too dissapointed. They left out so much that the whole development of the story and their love just felt extremely unrealistic and strange so that it made all of the romantic scenes laughable and weird. I mostly rolled my eyes and cringed as well as most of the theatre did. As soon as Hardin started speaking, everyone in the room burst out laughing because of how monotone he sounded and how weird his lines were.They left out so much of the character Hardin, his darkness and pain, the anger and the mood swings. On screen, all that tried to portray it was just him being a bit passive aggressive and cry sometimes. Be a bit moody but it was nowhere near what it could have been. This also made everything lose that deep passion that I think is the reason many people are captured by the books. Not many romantic books capture passion in that way and that´s what made it unique to me. When they left all of that out though, this just became a bland and boring cliché film.Usually when I watch rom-coms or whatever, I am at least a tiny bit captivated by them or can at least feel some compassion with the characters but this movie didn´t move me or make me feel anything at all even for a second. Which is sad because when I read the books I cried several times.The other thing that I think draws people in by the books is the sexual content. I heard this movie was gonna be the new ""fifty shades of grey"" but the attempt at this being sexual was the lamest I´ve ever seen. The sexual scenes were so not sexual it was weird that they were even there. And it´s a shame becasue I feel like the seuxality and the passion and darkness of Hardin was the whole core of this story and they left it all out and made it into just any other love story.And don´t get me started on the soundtrack.... it was pathetic.The one thing I liked was the visuals, they found great fitting characters, I loved the settings and I loved the modern but still retro feeling to it. It was pretty much perfect.
But perhaps such a complex story as After can´t be made into a 1,5 hour film without failure. It´s too bad though, it could´ve been great."
"2151","After",4,"IMDb record for most fake reviews + done many times before = pass","Decent directing, great soundtrack, but poor acting in a story done many times before. The long 106 min run time felt longer with the slow dragged out pacing. Then there's the IMDb record for the most 8-10/10 clearly fake reviews I've ever seen - wow. All have only reviewed this film. So obvious and sad. A big pass and very generous 4/10 from me."
"2152","After",1,"an absolute NIGHTMARE","Poor acting. The relationships were shallow and underdeveloped. The film overall was really really bad, to the point that I almost went out of the theater."
"2153","After",1,"Bad movie","This was a bad movie, It's a really empty movie, nothing happened! the character didn't have any chemistry, no dialog, this was a waste of time and money, my life deserves better. i almost stab my eyes with a fork. i prefer to see my eyes bleeding than to see this empty movie."
"2154","After",3,"An ersatz of Rebel without a cause","First things first, I clearly do not belong to the intended audience which is probably narrowed to female and romantic teens, between 11 and 15 years old. Possibly older, with a touch of nostalgia. Tessa, an ingenuous teen, leaves home, mum and high school in order to integrate university, her roommate inviting her to join an idle and carefree group. She meets there Hardin, a rebel without a cause (Nicholas Ray, 1956) but with a keen interest in literature, like herself. The continuation is relatively predictable and indubitably goofy. My own rating: 2/3 out of 10. My rating while trying to belong to the intended audience, with a generous empathy boosted to the extreme: 4/5 out of 10."
"2155","After",7,"An intense college romance with passion","After is the kind of film that could have gone horribly wrong. Well, it had all the ingredients - good girl, bad girls, brooding mysterious college hottie, wannabe college teens sporting nose piercings & tattoos, dysfunctional families & broken marriages..the list will go on. But what trumps all of this the heavyduty emotional texture of the film. The intense romance that develops between Tessa and Hardin in a conventional yet very mystical way. There are not many twists and the narrative is simple. However, it hoodwinks you into feeling that something really uncanny will happen - whether or not it does, is for you to find out. Makeout scenes are aplenty but none OTT. They are aesthetic and complimentary to the storytelling. Director Jenny Gage handles that well with his young, good looking actors keeping their next-door image intact. Audience will relate with their characters and root for both of them. Pace is slow but consistent with moments that will stay with you. Overall, AFTER is the kind of college romance everyone hopes for - it's got love, lust and heartbreak in equal measure!"
"2156","After",1,"Boring af","Well I wasn't expecting too much about this movie but I never thought it was this bad, omg it was so creepy to watch mainly their first time!!! What the hell was that? ""are you ready?"" and open the condom with the teeth and how can you put a freaking condom with one hand???Before you even start with the excuse ""you didn't read the books"" YES I read the books and there was essential parts that it should be in the movie, like Hardin forcing Tessa telling Noah that she was with him during the night, or the REAL MOTIVE of the bet, or Landon's and Tessa's friendship AND the most important thing Tessa's thing with Zed!!!! But no, instead you only focus on Tessa and Hardin kissing all movie, constantly looks for each other, her sighs...The movie itself wasn't worth it to watch because it all happened so fast most of the scenes didn't happened in the books... gosh I'm going to try to forget that this movie ever happened."
"2157","After",1,"Boring, dull and cliche romance film","Don't waste your time watching this predictable unintentional plot with lazy conclusion film ever. It is not worth watching at all, unless you want to entertain yourself with the pretty girl or pretty boy"
"2158","After",10,"90's vibe!!","I may be bias because I read and loved the books but it was a great movie. Just like any indie movie just starting out, it has its flaws. I felt because I read the book I noticed how rushed it was and all the changes but it wasnt that bad. The chemistry is amazing, the actors were great and it brought me back to when I watched you drive me crazy, shes all that and cruel intentions. Definitely gave me that throwback vibe and cult classic."
"2159","After",10,"One word: beautiful","I personally loved this movie. It's beautifully shot and the actors have an amazing chemistry. I read the books back in 2014 and the author herself said that the movie is going to be different since you can't really fit a 400 pages book in 100 minutes. The changes that they made were necessary in my opinion and I prefer the ""softer"" Hardin from the movie. The movie has a great message and shouldn't be getting so much hate just because it's not exactly like the books. 10/10 from me. Hoping for a second one! People should watch it with an open mind."
"2160","After",7,"Josephine is the sweetest girl i have seen in years","Josephine the girl who plays the lead role is the main reason to watch this average romantic drama which without Josephine would be boring as hell if u exclude last half an hour or so but Josephine and her chemistry with the the guy who played the other main role makes this movie worth of your time.
thank god we finally got something worth of a scenario twist in last 20 minutes and the movie ended strong but at the end Josephine is the reason to watch this film."
"2161","After",1,"Just Another Teen Movie","This movie is your typical good girl meets bad boy romance, so as for plot twists, can't say there were many. The acting was average at best, but it wasn't like the characters were exactly the most complex to portray, so I suppose the actors did their job. In addition, the characters either fit complete stereotypes or simply did not have any personalities at all. Side note: I refuse to applaud Anna Todd for making the movie ""diverse"". She made Tristan a girl, which would have been interesting had Pia Mia been on the screen for more than 4 minutes. Anyone else getting the same queerbaiting vibes as Riverdale? And representing the African American community with Landon wouldn't have been a problem had he had more duties than being the typical 'black best friend's stereotype.The biggest thieves of the screens were the two main characters, Tessa and Hardin. The movie focused much more on the romance between them rather than them as individual people with separate stories and personalities. For a movie that bragged about encouraging empowerment, they sure made Tessa seem dependent on Hardin and hinted at her being irrelevant without Hardin. I mean, a lot of romance movies are guilty of this, but still, it makes for some pretty unrelatable and boring characters, especially the female lead. Another side note: Josephine Langford is an okay actress, however the producers should have told her that her Australian accent came through way too much and asked her to do the scene again. The editing was a bit odd, including a lot of shots of characters just staring at each other and extreme close ups of body parts and objects. Jenny Gage was way too dependent on montages to save this film. In terms of plot, some of the character motives were lost in the fast-paced nature of the film. Believe me, it was incredibly too fast. This is something that happens a lot in book to film adaptations, since it is very difficult to cram what would be a 10 hour reading session in a 2 hour movie, but still, they could have tried a bit harder. Instead of trying to stuff a film with new scenes that have zero relevance, this movie should have at least tried to include scenes from the book that may have been a waste of time as well but at least they weren't brought out of thin air. This movie was, well, forgettable. Beyond average and disappointing. Overall, it just blends in with the rest of the teen romance genre, if anything being a flop to others in that category."
"2162","After",8,"wonderful","Coming from a person who has read the books from the start, the movie is amazing! For people who have read them all as well, I just want to say that it is best to walk into the theater with an open mind due to the fact that it is nearly impossible to fit an entire 600 pages into a film. Some things are changed from the novel and in my opinion I think it is for the best because I will admit...the book can be a little harsh for the big screen BUT 'After' is NOT romanticizing an abusive relationship. It is about two non-perfect people who find each other in the dark and bring light at the end. It's not a fairy tale story but it is a real one. A real life story that needs to be told considering the fact that there are people around the world who, more or less, have the same storyline as Tessa and Hardin. Personally speaking, I believe that everyone (read the books or not) will love this film! It's different from other romance movies and it is something new to people. It will leave the audience lost for words and wanting more for a sequel!!!"
"2163","After",10,"My love GREW!","I loved the movie. Reading the books and being so in love with them I was SO excited for this movie. If you're a true fan of the book then you should seriously just be glad you even have actual characters played out in front of you! You could tell the story was there! There is still so much see and witness from the book and these actors. There is SO much more of the story we love to be told. The books as Tessa & Hardin were written in 2014.. to make it adapt to 2019 there were changes. GOOD changes. And adaptation of the book isn't making it exactly like the book itself, it's taking bits and pieces (important) pieces and making it into its own! I love the curve they took with the film & I would give anything for them to be able to make sequels! What does it hurt anyone to be supportive of something others are passionate about!? I'm proud & in love with this film! I'm angry about people just not being supportive!"
"2164","After",10,"Loved it","I think the movie captured the essence of the book. It's quite impossible to make it 100% true to the book. I liked the adaptions, they made sense considering the length of the movie. The cemestry between Hero and Josephine is amazing, they did a wonderful job. Hardin is a bit softer than in the book, but I don't mind that at all because it's perfect for the movie. Some things happens really fast, but again an adaption I can live with because it works for the movie. The ending is so sweet and beautiful and I hope for more After movies. Overall love the books love the movie I'm a happy Afternator."
"2165","After",1,"I wasted 2 hrs that I could have used to drink paint.","Holy crap this was the most garbage cliche movie ever. The main character Tessa who is not like other girls bc i study meets Hardin who is a bad boy but he like literature and is really rapey like really. The acting is dry and worse than aNY porno I have ever seen. If u want to watch this i suggest you watch 50 shades instead because at least it's graphic enough to distract you from the garbage plot. The plot was so bad and all the ""dramatic"" part made me and my friends laugh so hard. We laughed at a lot of inappropriate times like I could sense those angsty teen girl glares. This was a waste of money and time and I would rather bang my head against the wall for 2 hrs than watch it again. I would rather get lead poisoning from drinking paint and then proceed to drink a puddle in the parking lot of a taco bell."
"2166","After",10,"Breathtaking","This movie is based off of the wattpad series by Anna Todd which was a great hit obviously. The book itself was incredibly addicting and so realistic and amazing. The movie did a wonderful job to create that feeling again and the cast and crew were just so amazing. The movie is about coming of age , boy meets girl . There's definitely more to it but I'll leave it for y'all to see. I loved every second of it and would watch it a billion more times , if you have not read the books definitely check them out. Praying for a sequel!!"
"2167","After",1,"Would rather drink garbage water","I would be more entertained eating a can of paint. This movie is a cliche teen romance drama. The plot is trash and it is extremely rushed and once the climax hit nothing happened. There was barely a build up and then it just farted in your face. The acting was so dry and was worse than the acting in a porno. The characters are terribly written. The main character Tessa is the worse version of the cliche ""sheltered virgin girl"" yet and Harden is a craptastic bad boy like holy crap. If you want to watch this movie I would suggest you watch 50 shades instead because at least 50 shades is graphic enough to distract you from the garbage plot. But if you want a good laugh I would watch this movie because it is so bad it's funny."
"2168","After",9,"Loved it!!!","I think the movie captures the essence of the book beautifully. It's an adaptation so the changes were necessary, the end result came together perfectly."
"2169","After",1,"12 years olds shouldn't be allowed to rate movies.","It's obvious that the people giving this abomination of a movie 10 stars are under the age of 15. This monstrosity was an adaptation of an apparently ""best-selling novel"" that was a rip off of a One Direction fanfiction. The main male character, who is a 12 year old's wet dream of Harry Styles, is an abusive and manipulative brute. Seriously kids, just go read your 1D fanfics. This movie and novels should have never been made."
"2170","After",10,"Amazing!!","The film is incredible, all changes were necessary, do not enter the movie theater thinking that you will see the book written in image, you will see After 2019, an improved and amazing version!! I love"
"2171","After",9,"It's was fantastic!! I loved it !!","Honestly I have been waiting for this movie for ages !! Since I love all the books so much! The movie was really interesting to me and I didn't feel board thoughout the whole thing. The movie and the book are very different to each other but still similar to each other in another way which was a nice new take on the story. The new scenes that were added in the movie were really cute and fun to watch too. I think both Hero and Josephine did a great job in portraying Hardin and Tessa. Josephine is really what I pictured Tessa to look and be like and her acting was enjoyable. Hero was amazing!! I loved his portrayal of Hardin Scoot I thought he did a fantastic job even though Hardin was a lot more softer in the movie than in the book which didn't really please me and a fan of the book but I felt it worked well with the story line of the movie. However even though I enjoyed the film sooooo much as a fan of the book I feel like some characters weren't played to their full potential in the movie my main concern was the absence of Zed's infatuation with Tessa which was very much present in the books but not in the film. The other characters also didn't get much screen time in the movie which was a shame as you couldn't see their true personalities but none the less I still enjoyed the film very much and I hope that there will be a sequel to the movie as there is a lot more to the story of Hardin and Tessa"
"2172","After",10,"AMAZING ADAPTATION TO THE BOOKS","I LOVED THIS MOVIE. I loved it because it was a true ADAPTATION of the After books which .... were not my favorite read to be honest. This movie fixed everything that I didn't like about the books. For example, it brought a diversity of personalities which you don't see in the books and there were way less ""Tessa crying"" moments, which were so repetitive in the books. HERO played Hardin AMAZINGLY WELL. I never thought they could find an actor who would so closely resemble Hardin--but they did. I remember Hero playing the young Tom Riddle in Harry Potter and I knew instantly that his career would take off when he got older. His ability to play dark, brooding characters is truly phenomenal.Josephine was absolutely beautiful, confident and strong. She is the Tessa I prefer to the Tessa in the books. Her smile, her eyes, her voice, everything she did was perfect. She LOOKED exactly as I pictured in my head.For those diehard fans of After that didn't like it, I truly feel bad. However, movies are never like the books.....take Harry Potter, Lord of the Rings just as a few examples.This movie is so romantic and beautifully filmed. It is not a waste of your money so please go see it!!!!!!!!!!!"
"2173","After",1,"one tip: run","Hmmm, well. That was quite the experience, i felt like a 12 years old girl. The actors are horrific and the music too. Just don't go see it."
"2174","After",1,"Its dissapointing and just not good enough.","All you need to know about After is that is based om a Wattpad fanfiction story about One Direction written by a 30 year old women fantasizing about 18 year old college boys. Thats it."
"2175","After",10,"Loved it !!","This movie was done beautifully and way better than I expected!!!! if you've read the book before it's best to keep an open mind because no movie will turn out exactly how it's told in it's novel. The cast and crew did an amazing job at telling Hardin and Tessa's love story, yes of course there could've been some minor changes but overall the movie was amazing and after waiting five years for my favorite novel to be made into a movie, it truly did not disappoint!!! Truly am hoping for a second movie so their story can be told in more detail !"
"2176","After",1,"oh boy","Well.....i was entusiastic to see the movie.i saw the trailer,bought the book and in 48 hours i finished.but the movie was.......dissapointing.ok i got it that was raited pg13 but the story is about a college girl.why would you do it pg13?and ok i agree not to have the sex scences form the book but at least don't twist the events from the book.the last part from the movie i agre to change it a little,but i don't understand the twisting of the events."
"2177","After",10,"give it a try!","If you love romances full of drama then you should definitely watch After! It's based on the first book and part of the second book of the series but the movie itself is a bit different from both. The acting was pretty good and the visuals and cinematography overall was breathtaking."
"2178","After",10,"AHHHHHMAZING!!","So hot. So sexy. Especially for being rated PG-13! They did speed the plot up a bit but it was necessary for time. Also love Hardin without piercings, makes him so much sexier. Also I actually really liked Tessa and wasn't annoyed with her like I was in the book. Overall FANTASTIC FLICK! Going to see it again for sure! 1010101010!!!!!"
"2179","After",10,"Realistic and consciously well delivered messages","This is one film that will stop your daydreams of the ideals and give you a spank of reality. A good mix of laughter and pain, awesome performance of the casts, and the undeniable chemistry of the two leads. Salute to the director as well for the conscious efforts of feminist approach. Cinematography is excellent. This movie is one amazing experience. People need to detach themselves from the book and should see the beauty of the film on its own. Can't wait for the sequels."
"2180","After",1,"Disappointed.","For someone that has read the books and loved them so much to re-read them several times, you could say I was really excited to see it come to life. I knew from the start that there was no way the whole book could be acted out into the movie. I went into the theater with an open mind and really hoping for movie that could bring the book characters to life. I knew beforehand that the characters names had to be changed from the Watt-pad version to the book and movie versions. As for the movie... I was disappointed in the fact that the story line was not followed correctly. Certain events in the book happens before others, but in the movie some events were missing. Just a lot of plot holes. Another thing was with Hardin's character. In the book his rude, cold, and demeaning behavior was a key part in the plot line and how Tess and Hardin reacted with each other. Minor details in the book were Hardin having a bunch of tattoos, in the movie there was a lot but not as many as the book portrayed. Another thing about Hardin's appearance was that in the book he had facial piercings which has a key moment in one of the books because he takes them out because they remind him of his past, however in the movie, Hardin's character does not have any facial piercings. It's just some of the minor details that have big meaning in the end that weren't in the movie that really had me disappointed. As for Tessa's character, she acted out pretty good to me, however, in the book she was an English major, in the movie she is an economics major. There are other events in the movie that are around this general idea that wasn't how the book was written, one being Hardin getting the job for Tessa at Vance, but in the movie Ken makes the first move and Tessa ends up emailing Kimberly herself with no help. Tessa, early on in the book, started looking for cars and eventually got one within the first book, in the movie she did not and she rode a bike everywhere. Fights between Tessa and Hardin weren't as violent I guess is the right choice of words as they were in the books. Personally, did not enjoy the movie. It was disappointing in the fact that minor details weren't kept, character development was poor, and the movie itself was rather short and to me felt like it was rushed. If there happens to be another movie, at the moment I don't know if I would go watch it after seeing this one. After isn't after with Zed vs. Hardin, Hardin being rude, cold, and his unruly behavior, Tessa being soft, the BET scene being how it was in the book. After waiting for 5 years now for this to come out, the only words to explain how I felt about it, is thoroughly disappointed."
"2181","After",1,"Here We Go Again","This movie is your typical good girl meets bad boy romance, so as for plot twists, can't say there were many. The acting was average at best, but it wasn't like the characters were exactly the most complex to portray, so I suppose the actors did their job. In addition, the characters either fit complete stereotypes or simply did not have any personalities at all. Side note: I refuse to applaud Anna Todd for making the movie ""diverse"". She made Tristan a girl, which would have been interesting had Pia Mia been on the screen for more than 4 minutes. Anyone else getting the same queerbaiting vibes as Riverdale? And representing the African American community with Landon wouldn't have been a problem had he had more duties than being the typical 'black best friend's stereotype.The biggest thieves of the screens were the two main characters, Tessa and Hardin. The movie focused much more on the romance between them rather than them as individual people with separate stories and personalities. For a movie that bragged about encouraging empowerment, they sure made Tessa seem dependent on Hardin and hinted at her being irrelevant without Hardin. I mean, a lot of romance movies are guilty of this, but still, it makes for some pretty unrelatable and boring characters, especially the female lead. Another side note: Josephine Langford is an okay actress, however the producers should have told her that her Australian accent came through way too much and asked her to do the scene again. The editing was a bit odd, including a lot of shots of characters just staring at each other and extreme close ups of body parts and objects. Jenny Gage was way too dependent on montages to save this film. In terms of plot, some of the character motives were lost in the fast-paced nature of the film. Believe me, it was incredibly too fast. This is something that happens a lot in book to film adaptations, since it is very difficult to cram what would be a 10 hour reading session in a 2 hour movie, but still, they could have tried a bit harder. Instead of trying to stuff a film with new scenes that have zero relevance, this movie should have at least tried to include scenes from the book that may have been a waste of time as well but at least they weren't brought out of thin air. This movie was, well, forgettable. Beyond average and disappointing. Overall, it just blends in with the rest of the teen romance genre, if anything being a flop to others in that category."
"2182","After",1,"Worse than Twilight or 50 Shades of Grey","I cringed everytime i watched Hardin and Tessa and their lines got me on my nerves so much. They take minutes to start talking and when they do it, they dont say anything relavant or logic and it sounds wrong. They do act like children or even worse.
Hardin is a wannabe trying to be creep, stalker, he's a baby boy, like grow up dude. The only issue with him happened when he was 8 years old like along time. Everyone has their traumatic experiences or stories. He's not even a victim of verbal or physical abuse from his family and he acts like his life is the worst...
He isn't even seen like a dangerous bad boy how the book portray him. Bad boys are strong, not a whiny baby... He's just an immature jerk and she is a disloyal girlfriend. I don't even understand how her boyfriend wasn't mad at her for betrayal. for accepting to be cheated on. I guess he was really tired of her. That or he had a girlfriend secretly too.
There is much i would say but i'm not even bothering my time. This movie sucks ass , bad message."
"2183","After",1,"What a slog","I watched the whole thing! Hard to believe all the 9 and 10 stars for this slog of a film. I kept waiting for something meaningful. Never happened!"
"2184","After",6,"Highly disappointed!!!!","After reading the novel I expected alot from this movie. It's true that you cannot make the entire novel into a movie. But the important scenes which happened should have been there. Everything happened so fast in the movie. Characters are so good but the plot is really not happening."
"2185","After",10,"A different adaptation of the book, but a beautiful film!","The book and the movie were very different from one another so when I watched the film it was hard to not want more. I feel like they did a great job with the casting, and I loved the actors chemistry! It was such a beautiful film, but I feel like a lot of people might be disappointed if they compared it to the books. If you separate them, you will enjoy the movie on its own. It definitely had a lot of potential, and I feel like they could have made the movie longer so that people who haven't read the book would understand what was going on because their love story felt rushed at the beginning. However, I really want them to make a second film and focus on keeping the relationship complicated. This film didn't really have any fights scenes, and I feel like it was a big part of what made their relationship so complicated. They definitely needed to expand the Hardin's character more so the viewers could see why Hardin was the way he was. Either ways, I loved the ending and overall the film left me feeling happy."
"2186","After",1,"Horrible","Worst hours of my life... Literally 0 good plot, just a plain, bland, cliché romance"
"2187","After",10,"Blown Away","This movie was GREAT! I am typically scared when my fave books turn into movies because the actors they choose may not fit your imagination or scenes you fell in love with may not make it into the film. With After??? I was pleasantly surprised!!! The cast was perfect, I felt I was experiencing their experiences as the movie went on. I was completely engulfed in the romantic relationship but more importantly by how Hero and Josephine were BOTH able to portray those strong emotions so effortlessly. They both are great actors and take their craft SERIOUSLY. I certainly hope we see more. Also, the soundtrack for this movie was PERFECT, sometimes you get a good soundtrack and you watch the film and it seems the songs dont ""match"" the scene you're looking at, but that was not the case at all!! Honestly, it's very evident the hardwork that went into this movie by everyone! Congrats to Anna, Hero, Josephine, Khadijah, Shane and just the whole gang!!! #proudafternator"
"2188","After",1,"terrible !!!!","Y'all about to be real mad at me, but it must be said ; i was so excited for this movie, read all 3 books and waited 3 wHOLE years for this, and to say i am disappointed would be an understatement !!!! this movie was absolute doodoo crack and i can't believe i wasted time of my life watching this . disgusting ."
"2189","After",10,"Absolutely breathtaking","After is based of the wattpad series by Anna Todd. The series itself were so incredibly addictive. The movie was just as good ! I loved every second of it & enjoyed the casting do such an amazing job to portray Anna Todd's book. This movie will have you at the edge of your seat with all squeals !! My favorite movie of all time now for sure. Hopefully we get a sequel. If you haven't read the books definitely do so !! It's totally worth it ."
"2190","After",1,"NOOOOOO. NOOOOO GOD NOOOOOO","THIS MOVIE WAS VERY VERY BAD. Whoever produced this movie can go to hell the movie look like it had a budget of $5 the only thing that was good about the movie was the camera quality barely where was the plot where was the acting I don't know in conclusion do not see this movie"
"2191","After",10,"Waited many years for this, and it exceeded my expectations.","I read the story and it's sequels on Wattpad as they were released. I remember waiting patiently every week for a new chapter to be released so I could keep up with it, as I was absolutely hooked. Fast forward a few years and the stories become published books (of which I own them all and have read them a thousand times over), and I didn't think it could get any better than that. Fast forward ANOTHER few years, and the story gets a movie deal! I had never been more excited for a movie before in my life. I'll admit, I was very nervous. It's typical for movies to not do books justice. However, the After movie went above and beyond my expectations. I loved every minute of it and every aspect that they added to the story to make it work for the big screen. Sensual scenes and incredible chemistry between its leading actors, I will keep seeing it in cinemas over and over again so that I will definitely get more movies to complete the story of Hardin and Tessa."
"2192","After",3,"I didn't even finished watching it","I read the first book in 2 days! This movie does even satisfy at least 30min of my time.
Rushed, so badly changed and half of the book is cut in pieces.Read the books - skip this movie.."
"2193","After",8,"I want more","I thought the movie was good! Since I read the books my brain was filling in some blanks that they left out which is fine because you can't do everything in the movie adaption. The acting was pretty good considering how new to acting they are. I enjoyed it. I want to see it a couple more times to get the chance o a sequel up."
"2194","After",10,"Amazing, relatable college romance","I loved this movie. Yes there were changes from the book, but there is a huge difference in how much you can include in a book vs. a movie. I think the changes were great and those who have read the book need to go into the movie with an open mind. I had a friend accompany me who has never read the book and she absolutely loved the movie and how relatable it was, especially to her college experience freshman year. Sure, there were some things I wish were included and I wish there could've been more time to explain certain things, but like I said there is only so much you can include in a movie adaptation. I think the changes benefited the movie for an overall audience to make it appeal to everyone, and not just book readers. There absolutely NEEDS to be a sequel, especially with the way the movie ended. 10/10 for acting and chemistry, loved the leads. 10/10 for the whole movie. would 100% recommend."
"2195","After",4,"Dissapointed!","I've been waiting the movie for almost 3 years, since i ve read the books. It was very disapointing for me. When i ve got home, i ve started to read again the books and it was a huge diference between them. If you want to make a movie after a book, dont ruin the story, dont skip important detailes, because for the readers is very frustrating!"
"2196","After",1,"DONT WASTE YOUR MONEY OR TIME","It was the worst adaptation ever!!!!! The only common thing between the book and the movie are names of the characters... I hate it"
"2197","After",1,"Disgusting","A disgusting movie based off of a disgusting Wattpad story - written by a child who glorified abuse.
This movie is awful."
"2198","After",1,"Poorly executed and disappointing","I think everyone who has written a positive review about this movie is a fan of the books and simply just wants a sequel. I have read the books, and although they cannot compare to similar young adult series such as the mortal instruments, divergent or the hunger games, there are some obvious real world characters and problems, which I at least thought the movie would address. I was extremely disappointed with the movie, not just because the actual essence of the story was lost, but there was no depth to the characters or the story whatsoever. The plot jumped all over the place, which made it extremely hard to follow, the cinematography was strange in parts, and the scenes did not flow from one to the other. I think this is another unfortunate book adaptation which will most likely be forgotten due to its poor execution much like vampire academy or Percy Jackson. Can't see this getting a sequel and I am confused by all the perfect reviews, because it certainly wasn't anywhere near even a good movie."
"2199","After",1,"Terrible for those who haven't read the books.","Worst movie I've seen in a long time. I didn't read the books, (I tried but the writing was terrible and needed an editor...badly.) I figured the movie would be better and would be a good way to support it. But my god. TERRIBLE. The ""couple"" were in love in 2 seconds. The viewer didn't have enough time to even process what was happening or WHY. Because there was NO connection and NO plot.
Now, I KNOW I'm the ""odd person out"" because a billion people who read the books will disagree, but I'm sorry, I can't lie. For the 65% of the population who live on earth who have NOT read the books. This crap made no sense.
NO PLOT. (I'm going to keep saying this, because I've never watched a movie without one before.) However, It was like the director and author (who was highly involved based on all the press interviews with the cast members) decided to take the most popular scenes and just make a movie montage.
There was barely any tension or a challenge...just bad. The person I saw it with didn't read the books either and he wanted to walk out like 5 times because he was so bored and confused. We also laughed because some of the scenes were just so terrible. There was one scene where I guess (I have no idea because the way it was cut was so strange) but Hardin was supposed to be doing something sexual to her, but like...they just looked at one another for a few seconds (she didn't even so much as moan so it was super confusing just watching her face stare up blankly at the ceiling) before the scene cut and they were laying in bed cuddling with her pants off. Me and my partner looked at each other in confusion and both whispered: ""Wtf just happened?""
The whole thing was just dumb. There were scenes that could have been cut. Like when she went to the car with that gut and asked where Hardin was. WHY? Why waste 2.5 minutes of film of that when the scene before the viewer (and the actress) were SHOWN the text messages explaining where Hardin would be. Those 2.5 min could have helped the beginning of the film and developed the relationship a bit more before the lake scene (like three scenes into the movie) where they're in love. I just don't understand how the heck they have all these deep feelings toward one another? They knew each other for 2 days max before they were in a lake and he was all, ""I don't think we can ever be just friends?"" Such a confusing and strange film. Surely people 16 and older are smarter than this?Also: As a side note I don't understand the BS this movie got before opening day. This relationship wasn't ""abusive"" in the least. Hardin was actually really sweet and the bet wasn't that big of a deal. She fell in love, he fell in love. He cried like a baby in the rain for her. I am NOT going to sit through part 2 of a movie where this chick is going to berate him and for there to be no plot again. NO."
"2200","After",1,"Couldn't wait for it to be over.","I may be biased since I read the book series & loved it but I felt the only connection between the book and the movie were the names. It felt rushed & there was no build up or back story to either character. I understand you only get 2 hours to fit a 600 page book but at least try to put some of the actual storyline in there! Overall I wish the writers would have tried to stay true to Anna Todd's vision"
"2201","After",1,"Really?","This is not a story to learn from. You know what would've been a story to learn from?
NOT GETTING INVOLVED IN THIS TWISTED STORY TO BEGIN WITH.
Are people losing their minds nowadays?
Yes... he is a bit of a trouble, but I am going to fix him because love heals everything and everyone.
How this EVER went right?
Let's teach girls how to fend for themselves and STOP ROMANTICISNG ABUSE!"
"2202","After",10,"great","Recommend. greatest movie so far this year. go see right away!!!"
"2203","After",2,"An absolute disappointment","This movie adaption of the book ""after"" is an embarrassment. The movie seems very loosely based on the novel and has very little similarities. Watching this movie all I could do was laugh in disbelief! Don't waste your time if you are a fan of the books!"
"2204","After",10,"Love the story","I loved the chemistry that the actors had. And I loved the perspective the movie took of this story. It's uniqueness is enthralling."
"2205","After",1,"Didn't even come close to comparing to the book!","If you read the After books then I suggest not watching the movie!! It was missing so many key components and character developments. And if you didn't read the books you'll have absolutely know idea what is going on the entire movie."
"2206","After",5,"An ACTUAL waste of time","Let me be completely honest. Even after rating 1,429 titles on this site, this is my first ever review on IMDb. I couldn't get to this page quick enough after watching it! This movie is such a cliche it hurts. Nothing about it makes much sense, and when the characters get *~deeply~* hurt, the very next scene the film show them making up to the person who did the initial damage. My only fear is that this series actually gets extended into another 3 sequels because MAN wouldn't that be a treat."
"2207","After",2,"Not even close to the original story of the book","1. Loved the actors
2. Some details won't make it able for the cast to shoot some scenes of the second movie (after we collided)
3. Information that was given from the book that changed the whole story, wasn't shown in the movie.
Generally, I think that If you haven't read the book, you shouldn't watch it, because you will completely misunderstand the whole plot. If you have read it, though, it will be a nice experience to watch it, and compare the book with the movie.
For me, the book takes 9/10 but the movie takes 2/10"
"2208","After",3,"Totally wrong and disappointing","I've read all the 5 books in less than 12days recently. Dont have to tell you i loooovedd it. I litterally fall in love with Hardin and Tessa, their story, even if it was a love/hate relationship. I was left with a big hole in my heart when i finished reading the last line. The story have made me felt soo much emotions. Never had a book touch me like this.So... Dont need to tell you i was veryyyy disapointting by the movie. All the scene goes way to fast, arent well developped, some are even switch compared to the storyline, whick make no sense. You cant understand the complexity, the toxicity, the passion of their relationship in this movie. Hardin is way too soft. Tessa dont seem like the perfect little girl who control anything in her life. All the second characters seems to be there just to fill the screen, without any explanation of their role in the story. Honestly, I wonder how they could even think of making the next movies to be more representative as there is soo much important things missing in the first one.I dont expect a movie to be as great as the book (it never happened in my opinion), but they really missed the point with that one trying to make it a PG movie. Just seems like another boring teen movie.In my point of view, if you can't explore all the complexity of a story like that in a 90min movie, make it a tv shows!"
"2209","After",4,"ais311","This film is very simple. I could expect what's gonna happen. Characters are beautiful but story isn't exciting."
"2210","After",4,"Poor movie, books are better","First of all, I have read the books. I liked them because of the development of the characters, the fluent action and you get to understand why things were in a certain way. I was eager to read forward and to know more about Hardin and Tessa. Second, I saw the movie. Didn't impress me at all. I think the lead actress was the only one who actually did a great job, but the cast didn't have any chemistry. It was boring, actually i was doing something else while I was watching, or better said, listening. The way the trailer was presented, I thought is going to be amazing. But I liked the songs during the movie. I don't think there is going to be a second part."
"2211","After",2,"Not worth your money or time.","It's an infinite symbol tattoo made into a movie. The whole movie is a clichè of what a high school girl considers romantic but its neither romantic or enjoyable."
"2212","After",1,"I didn't like it","Do not waste your time or money it's not worth it. Hardin is not even Hardin just really bad I'm serious"
"2213","After",6,"Disappointed on not doing the book justice.","First I would like to say the characters fit the roles perfectly. The movie though should not have been PG13, it should of been rated R so the REAL Harden & Tessa could of been expressed better. The story on the movie was told soooo confusingly, if I didn't read the book I would have been so lost. It's sad to see such a great book not get its justice that it deserves. Hope they have second movie and redeem themselves."
"2214","After",10,"A MASTERPIECE","Have i words to explain how much this film is amazing?No. Yes,i'm speechless,there aren't words or adjectives worthy of this film,it's more than amazing.
Why?
it isn't just a teen love story, it teaches a lot, especially for the age in which we live, it has been adapted for an audience in 2019. we all need to get a message from this film, everyone has their own. And i think it isn't comparable to other films. And obviously the acting exceeds the perfection, the actors identified themselves in their character and made the film truly believable and spectacular.
What are you waiting for?Go to the cinema,now!"
"2215","After",1,"Absolutely Terrible","This movie is the most cliché movie I've ever seen. A cliché movie can be good. But, this movie definitely is one of the worst. It succeeded in nothing. I wonder if this will even make enough money to cover its budget. It's obvious that this was made as a money grabber, but I think that it's stupidity will stop it from even being a money grabber. First off, sometimes the screenwriting and directing can be bad, but the acting can somewhat save the movie. This movie definitely doesn't do that. All the actors and actresses in this movie show how bad a person can act. This made me feel like I was watching a B-rated movie(obviously it was one). The guy who plays the role of Hardin shows how someone with only looks can be in a movie. His acting makes me feel like I someone is spitting acid into my eyes. Whenever he says something, I could feel the awkwardness. Was that in the script? No. It's clear that this character is supposed to be some ""cool"" and ""interesting"" character. All this actor shows me is how awkward acting can be. In fact, the there is no chemistry between any of the characters. Hardin and Tessa? No. Tessa and her mom? No. Tessa and every other character? No. Hardin and every other character? No. Every time there was an interaction between any characters, I felt as if they were reading off a script. Obviously they were, but an actors job is to make that seem impossible. Their job is to make the audience believe what they're watching. Nothing in this movie felt realistic. Nothing in this movie made me interested in it.Second, the plot was just a disaster. For example, it was no surprise that they would do a truth or dare game and it'll be revealed that the main girl is a virgin. It was no surprise when her mom came into her dorm when the two were making out. It was no surprise that the the guy started to date the girl as a bet. It was the plot of some 10 year old's fan fiction. Even a 90 year old grandpa could write a better teen romance than this. The screenwriting was written in a mess. Why? The screenwriter's job is to show the audience what the characters feel. Their job is to make these characters not one dimensional. Every character should have a motive. Yes. Even the sub characters. If you want to make a great film, every character should be filled with emotion and motives. The first character that makes absolute no sense is Tessa. She is written to be a goody two shoes girl that turns into a ""I-Lost-My Virginity"" girl. Now if they really wanted to make the main character a cliché character, they should've gave her depth. No, they do the exact opposite. She is seen to become a bad girl just because she meets the boy. That's exactly it. There's nothing special about him. He just falls in love with him and feels like she should become rebellious. It's actually pretty idiotic. She's the most one dimensional character I've ever seen on screen. Now Harden is just a guy. A guy that has an English accent and is mysterious. That's it. He's just there to show how what love is to the main girl. I could go on like this to every character in this movie because that's how problematic the screenwriting is.In conclusion, this is one of the worst movies I've ever seen in my life. I regret spending 8 dollars on this. It's worth nothing. I can't believe some people would watch this movie and think that it's actually watchable. If anyone would want to watch a movie with no plot, no depth in the characters, no sense in anything, I would recommend this movie. Absolute disaster of a movie it truly is."
"2216","After",3,"made for 14-year-old girls","I had a lot of expectations going to the cinema to see the premiere of this film and left utterly disappointed. I don't understand how people are comparing it to the 50 shades franchise. I'm not saying that 50 shades triology was amazing, but this film was not even close to being sensual and sexy. The passion between the two main characters was non-existent and all the lines were extremely cheesy and unbelievably hilarious. Instead of falling in love with the characters and their relationship, I was laughing at them. This film was a let-down, the only good scenes were the beautiful nature shots. If I saw this film at home I would stop watching it after 20 minutes.
After saying all that, I can image a 14-year-old me enjoying this film. So maybe if you're a young teenager, discovering love and romance, give it a try because you might like it. But if you're an adult, don't be bothered to spend money and see this film, you'll be dissatisfied."
"2217","After",10,"Incredible Love Story.........","I have not read the books, and nor did the people I saw the movie with.....but we all really enjoyed it! I can say this, no book will ever be perfectly adapted into a movie.....so people need to calm down when trying to compare. Taking a few hundred page novel and fitting it into 100 script pages is just not going to happen. That said, it's a well acted and great story. The soundtrack is amazing, and it's a fun trip to the movies. A great date movie."
"2218","After",3,"Poor Adaptation","I am a hard core fan of Anna Todd and of the After series. I was so excited to see this movie. I was so disappointed. It is completely different from the book! Even the big twist at the end was changed. This movie could have been so much better. I felt like the complexity of Hardin's character was lacking. There were no ups and downs, screaming fights, crying Tessas. I was disappointed. However, the acting was fairly good. Langford makes a great Tessa."
"2219","After",4,"Genuinely disappointed","After reading the first book in a matter of days to say I was excited for the movie was an understatement.I do understand that the whole novel can't be put in the movie but I'm sure there was room for more, and some of the changes that were made from book to movie..... should have been left alone in my opinion.That being said I think the characters were spot on even though I wish we could've seen more of some of them."
"2220","After",2,"Trash for the youths.","This is clearly a movie targeting young audiences, but missing the target in delivering a good story.
The character arcs are vague and almost inexistent.
We never get to know any of the 3 people in the movie, letting this to no sense of empathy when the big twist arrives.
The acting is numb and the directing sad.A movie worth not seeing."
"2221","After",2,"Awful","They took a R rated book and ""tried"" to make it a PG-13 movie. If you love the book and the story don't even bother going to see the movie. You will be disappointed!"
"2222","After",5,"I wanted my money back","This film had almost no redeeming qualities; except for the Actors. I could tell the script was painful for almost all the Actors in the film. It's really sad because this film had a ton of potential. Weak plot and storyline. Also, I felt like there was next to no dialogue in the movie."
"2223","After",3,"Terrible acting and bad dialogs","I like teen movies, but this doesn't even qualify to go under that category. Dialogs are shallow, boring and sound so fake, which is why the acting couldn't be good as well. The actors didn't have any good material to work with, and that's the reason their acting is also poor. The movie was like a teenage version of 50 shades of grey when it comes to quality of dialogs and acting..."
"2224","After",4,"Nothing like the book","I loved the book and couldn't wait for the movie, only to be let down and given a poor excuse for what could have been a different movie, one we don't often see.

"2226","After",10,"Deep","I feel like book readers get it more. You have to have an open mind, it's a true life book/film. It's not toxic it's typical reality which normal films don't go into. There also is a great show of protective sex and consent. It importantly shows a condom which many other films don't"
"2227","After",1,"Nope","One of the worst movies I've ever seen.
I have read the books, so I already knew walking into the cinema, this wasn't going to be a masterpiece. Boy, that's an understatement. The characters were flat, the story was rushed, they changed the storyline in a way that really didn't make sense. One could say ""how do you get a over 100 chapter book into one 1.45min movie?"" well, by actually adding stuff from the second book as well, of course. It doesn't Make sense. They left out crucial plot points that would have made the movie much more interesting.
And then the fact that half the movie consists of slow motion, making out/'romantic' scenes that are boring us to death.
Sure, I'm not the intended age group, 21 is a bit old for a young adult movie, but there are movies of the same genre I still enjoy.
The only good thing I can name is the casting.
This should mever have made it to the cinemas."

"2229","After",1,"STOP Romanticizing Toxic Relationships!","The fact that this movie won 3 Teen Choice Awards is seriously disturbing. Is this the kind of movie we want to promote to the female teen audience?
Bad boy just needs a good woman to tame him. NO! This is a toxic relationship, and we need to stop promoting it! So many teen movies have this at the core and it's sending the wrong message.
This is not what a good and healthy relationship looks like. This is what you RUN from. Ladies, you're not responsible for ""fixing"" a man."

"2231","After",1,"A Cruel Intentions Wannabe","I have watched a lot of good and bad teenaged/young adult movies, and this is one of the bad ones. Sooo many bad vibes, the terrible lines like, 'you never have to cover up in front of me'. It made my skin crawl by the end just to hear the guys voice. The reactions of the mother and the ex boyfriend when she comes home, like they just forgive her? It what world are the writers living in? She had sex with another guy while he was back at her place waiting for her and you think he would just forgive her? Really??Very over-the-top unrealistic characters, over used tropes, the guy was a bad actor and terrible script made me write this review in hopes the writers actually see this. I wrote one other writer about how angry the movie made me because it was sooo bad, and this is the second (and this is coming from a guy who watched Crow 4 and didn't write in about it).You want to watch an over the top, bad young adult movie, watch Cruel Intentions...sure, it have terrible acting, but at least it tries to be original."
"2232","After",1,"Utter rubbish","Acting is meh, dialogue is garbage, plot is horrendous"
"2233","After",5,"Love the book, hate the movie","I read the books on wattpad and I have been a fan for so long and was so excited for this movie because. The movie however has nothing to do with the book. I felt like because the original book had to do with one direction they made it PG-13 so that younger people would be able to watch it. The movie should've been rated R because it didn't even portray the characters in the book."
"2234","After",9,"Cute teen love story","I'm surprised by the bad reviews and rating. I am 40 and just wanted a light, cute love story to get away from all the drama going on in our world. This movie won't win any awards but the acting by the main characters is good, the love story is cute, and it got me away from all the awful news and politics.The plot is not new, the characters could have been better developed, the main character and her boyfriend in high school was a little strange, and the love story could have (and wish it did) gone on longer. The ending was sweet but it left something to be desired, but this is just a teen love story."
"2235","After",5,"Cringe","Haven't read the book (maybe it's better), but the plot seems fatally flawed. The characters all spend a significant portion of the movie overreacting to things. The various conflicts seemed forced and easily avoidable if characters just explained or didn't overreact.
This movie doesn't depict college very accurately either. I swear nothing ever that interesting happened in college.
The ending ruins whatever amount of dignity this movie has left. It feels like no one learned anything, leaving me to wonder what the whole point of this is.
I will say the two characters have some interesting moments and some well written scenes every now and then."
"2236","After",5,"Poor plot & poor acting","It wasn't a disaster, but it could've been done so much better. On simple scenes the actors were acting like kids in middle school. Not all, some were really good. The plot needs more, everything was so quick that you don't get the chance to feel any emotion representing. A lot of clichées and predictable. Anyhow, some of the music was good. And his car."

Every 5 minutes a pop song started in the background and the dialogues were not really deep. Nevertheless the characters are well played and the movie had some good moments. Just think that maybe the 10 stars reviews are faked.."
"2239","After",4,"Stripped from the books essence and lacking depth","Every time there is a movie adaptation of a book, there always seems to be the same kind of comments, talking about the little insignificant differences. Entering the cinema, I had in mind there would be several differences and adaptations, so I obviously didn't feel bothered by the dress that changed color, the teacher that was no longer a man, the same sentences said in similar words. I had previously read the book, and am aware that there was a severe backlash due to the portrait of a toxic relationship and its romanticisation towards a very young audience, therefore the need to take away the violence, the heavy vocabulary and the sexual scenes was found when remaking the story. The problem seems to be that without Hardin's dark side, childhood traumas, abusive behavior, without Tessa's emotions on her skin, stubbornness, and without the fights driven from their personalities clashing, both the characters and movies are left shallow. There is nothing to them. The secondary characters were also not handled properly. In the book series, there is a very dynamic interference of this characters on the main story line, leaving loose ends on the beginning to be found i the end, providing new levels of depth to the story. The movie however failed of both subjects, lacking total content, becoming just one more ""teenage"" movie with a cliche romance that will be forgotten in months.
When a story is taken by another artist and put in a new medium i expect to see a new take on it, to see how this new artist felt so captivated by the book that they had to bring it to life. Nevertheless, Susan McMartin, responsible for the script, failed. The whole movie felt rushed, leaving the viewer confused on the story line. There was a lot to be explained in this movie, and it certainly wasn't said nor shown. The scenes lack correlation, making the viewer believe the whole story happened between five conversations made of small talk, showing itself to be very unrealistic.
The acting left a lot to wish for, the best performance was delivered by Josephine Langford (playing Tessa Young), however, none of the actors were able to give a truth sense of their characters, lacking versatility and depth.
And the characters themselves, when stolen most of its traits, became very flat and stereotypical. Molly is simply ""the bitchy/slutty girl"", a if there is nothing left to her but who she wishes to sleep with, and some mean comments (this is something I find disturbing in the book as well.) Even the main characters became a rude boy and a studious girl.
In conclusion, I must admit i wasn't expecting this movie to be good, due to the circumstances in which it came to be, and the budget i imagined was on the table, and I was correct. The movie stripped away all the essence of the books, portraying only the most superficial layer of the relationship, and still doing it in an awkward choice of scenes and dialogue."
"2240","After",10,"AMAZING","I saw it last night and it was sooo good!!! I've read the books and obviously there were some scenes that didn't make the movie that I wish did but it was still overall amazing!!! Josephine and Hero did an amazing job!!! They are incredibly talented!!! I love them so much and I hope we get a the rest of the series made into movies!!!!"
"2241","After",6,"Best Romance!","This movie is so different from all the other teen movies about there. If you read the books I think you will be pleased. I do think that there could have been more time added to the movie to help the story move easier."
"2242","After",9,"Soooo Amazing","Going into this movie I knew I needed to keep an open mind. I was prepared to have things that I wanted from the book to not be in the movie. Having said that I truly believe that the movie captured the essence of Hessa. There were some things that the characters did that I was like ""hardin would never"" or ""im not really sure if that would happen"" but Hero did such an amazing job of showing the brokenness and complexity of the character. Josephine was also The most amazing and perfect Tessa we could have gotten, and their CHEMISTRY! It's really something you have to go and see for yourself. The main problem I had was the editing. I really hope we get some kind of extended cut or something on dvd because there were parts where it would skip to the next scene and it was confusing at times. For someone who hasn't read the books they would have no idea what was going on. So hopefully for the sequel *fingers crossed* the editing is better. Overall I would recommend going and seeing this in my opinion the Story is still there, but we need to have the other movies in order to fully develop it."
"2243","After",1,"Such a disappointment","I was so happy when I saw that they were making one of my favorite books in to a movie. 20 minutes in I realised that this would be awful since they hade already deviated so much from the original story. The movie were missing several key scenes and plot points and the characters had no real depth. A no no for me is when you change one of the main characters, they are part of the reason as of why people fall in love with stories in the first place, so why change them? A really weak, rushed and bad movie over all."
"2244","After",5,"Trailer was better than the movie","I am one of those people who actually read the books and was eagerly looking forward to seeing those amazing characters being brought to life. Although I have to say I was disappointed and angry that the director along with the writer missed this great opportunity to make an astounding movie from such great content from the book.Sadly, the storyline written in the book is involved in the slightest, which I think was a huge mistake. Everything that makes ""After"" After was cut out and replaced with scenes that might look like they've been cut out from some Instagram filter - fantasy world, but doesn't move the plot further or doesn't do anything to help develop the characters as well. I feel like there have been so many scenes that weren't finished or just simply weren't important. I think that this movie could have been so much better if they just stuck to the book more strictly.Also, the characters development wasn't as great as I thought it would be, I mean the actors' features did resemble the ones, you would imagine from the book, but the acting and playing had its flaws. It was maybe because both of the actors have so little experience or just simply weren't able to perform the characters correctly. For example Tessa in the book is more overthinking things, not just jumping into things 2 seconds after Hardin says it, and on the other hand, Hardin is much ruder and mocking, seductive.. than in the movie.Also I simply just don't understand why they decided to label this movie with PG-13 when half of the book is contained from sex scenes or intimacy. This was another thing that disappointed me the most.Also, I feel like the whole movie would have been much more realistic if they showed us more dramatic scenes like the intense arguments between Tessa and Hardin, the flaws of their toxic relationship and also the complicated past of Hardin's which led him to be the way he is.From my point of view, this movie wasn't the worst I've ever seen, but if I recall it today, I can't even remember the plot, I mean nothing really happened in there. The scenes were beautiful and all, but it just seemed so unrealistic. It felt like if I was watching the trailer for 1 hour and 46 minutes."
"2245","After",10,"Different than the book but amazing!","I personally have read the book multiple times and if you compare it, you'll feel like you're not getting it all. They left out a lot of scenes that would've explained the relationship of Hardin and Tessa better so you feel like the relationship is rushed. I do hope they make another movie and that will allow to further explain the relationship they have but overall the movie left me wanting more and I absolutely LOVES the ending."
"2246","Motherless Brooklyn",8,"A Calm, Engaging Mystery","Edward Norton, by most film fans, has been and will always be known as one of the best actors out there. Appearing in classics like Fight Club and more modern masterpieces like Birdman, he's never been one to pick a bad project on purpose. Motherless Brooklyn marks his latest leading role, while also directing and writing. As ambitious and difficult as that is, he has pulled it off quite well. Motherless Brooklyn is a very well-made period piece.Set in the 1950s, this film follows Lionel(Edward Norton) after the murder of his closest friend and colleague. Hellbent on discovering who the killer is, he finds himself on a paper trail across Brooklyn, never giving up on his plan. Being someone who also happens to suffer from Tourette Syndrome, he is a character that has a lot of depth to get behind. Personally, this particular character needed a great performance in order to be authentic, which is where this film shines the most.It's been a while since I've seen Edward Norton this committed to delivering a powerful performance. There are hardly any instances where he feels like he doesn't actually suffer from this condition. His devotion is what kept me engaged because the overall story does slightly meander at times. At nearly two and a half hours, this film can feel its length at times, but that's simply due to the fact that this movie cares about its characters and spends a lot of time on long conversations, some of which do lead to revelations though.Based on a book, this screenplay here definitely feels inspired and the voiceover work by Norton calms the viewers throughout, making for a sort of relaxing experience. In addition to that, the use of classical and jazz music is so much in the forefront that it nearly became a character of its own in the film. I really admired that aspect. Still, the overall movie doesn't leave too much for the audience to figure out, since the narration does lend a hand.In the end, Motherless Brooklyn is a really, really solid crime mystery that has the perfect setting and feel for this sort of premise. I found myself completely engrossed in this world and was eager to see where the movie ended up. Edward Norton gives an award-worthy performance and his direction only adds to that, making for a great overall movie. Motherless Brooklyn may be meant for a more mature audience as it is quite niche in terms of the nature of the story, which may lend itself better to an older crowd. Even so, I quite enjoyed myself."
"2247","Motherless Brooklyn",7,"Gorgeous depiction of '50's New York in color & music despite dense plot.","If you couldn't keep up with Chinatown's and LA Confidential's plot and continuous placing and connecting of characters' names associated with civic and political corruption then Motherless Brooklyn will have you drowning in it.That's why I give it a seven rating. It's almost 2 1/2 hours of figuring out what's going on and who's doing it, but at least the look and sound of the movie provides a huge respite with the best sounding Bee Bop jazz and lush background theme soundtrack I've ever heard in a movie.As a photographer I thought the cinematography was stunning in color and composition, less film noir and more '50's style New York street Kodachrome photography with compositions of odd reflections and angles interspersed smoothly with the flow of the narrative master shots in a style similar to Winogrand and Vivian Maier.The variety of vintage '50's automobiles in pristine and brand new condition with the rich look of Kodachrome color is another treat. The sound of the rattle of car doors slamming is even accurate."
"2248","Motherless Brooklyn",10,"A tight and gripping movie","The movie recreated the 1950s NY in an amazing way. Great cast who portrayed their roles with authenticity. It had a nice leisurely pace but held on to the suspense till the end. Saw during the NYFF premier ... it was a great choice to end the 2019 festival. Would recommend the movie for anyone who can appreciate good meaningful cinema.Motherless Brooklyn is the kind of movie Hollywood almost never makes anymore, and a complexly conceived, robust evocation of a bygone era of New York that speaks to our present moment."
"2249","Motherless Brooklyn",9,"A heartfelt throwback to classic Noir","Motherless Brooklyn is a modern film Noir about a troubled man seeking answers, exploring new worlds within familiar ones, and going toe-to-toe with violent thugs and oppressive tyrants, in the heart of New York during its blossoming years. It also just may be Edward Norton's ""Sling Blade.""Some of its most noticeable achievements, are the visual and audial elements. With the gloomy, yet bustling sets, and the somber, thoughtful soundtrack, the effective lighting and mood of each shot, it's a brilliant homage to the classic Noir style. It's not even just a throwback, but could eventually be considered a monumental addition to the genre.And the acting. Expect nothing less from such a stellar, experienced, well thought out cast. Edward Norton nailed it especially, and shines a humorous, yet wondrous and even educational light on Tourette's syndrome. Excellent performances by all.Story-wise, it's nothing groundbreaking. But it's certainly engaging. One can tell it's no cookie-cutter script, a lot of heart went into it. Sure some may find it boring, slow, presumptuous even. Others will find it exhilarating, and refreshing. Hopefully most will find the passion, love, message, and humor in it, and also discover that it could be that movie which so many people have been wishing Hollywood would make, instead of those dry, cash-cow blockbusters that stain the very heart and art of filmmaking itself. While also being unique in its own way, it's also familiar, without being too familiar if you know what I mean.I wish Bruce Willis was in it more, and there are some plot holes and mildly annoying coincidences, cliches, etc. These are few and far in between. While it can be difficult to follow at times, it's still quite a fantastic movie.Those who would enjoy this movie, probably also enjoyed other titles like Chinatown, L.A. Confidential, Road to Perdition, The Sting, Double Indemnity. See it in theaters, you'll find yourself driving down Nostalgia lane in a vintage 1950's Chevy."
"2250","Motherless Brooklyn",7,"Just One Problem","I found this film satisfying overall, but one anachronism distracted me and pulled me out of the 1950s setting. Lionel's symptoms of Tourette's syndrome, repetitive verbalizations of a rhyming nature, were accepted equanimously by everyone he encountered. No one displayed annoyance, made fun of him, or called him insulting names to cast aspersions about his intelligence. His repetitive touching of people on the shoulder as he faced them ought to have caused women to back away and men to knock his block off. They did neither. It was as if these 1950s characters had been taught the acceptance of people with disabilities that was not really commonplace until the 21st century. This is the biggest mystery in the movie."
"2251","Motherless Brooklyn",10,"Kiss her face all night long Baily","Edward Norton is a talented man! I was enthralled, I laughed, I screamed; I was captivated. The other big names pulled their weight Bruce Willis- ""get my hat ya mook!"" - was brief but effective as his role as head detective. I especially liked the morose yet determined character William Defoe played. The jazz scene was a treat. All the authentic time period cars and fine details he set, along with the lighting and framing give you what you really need and didn't know it in a movie... I hope this movie does well, but I think it's probably too great a project to gain as many accolades as it deserves! Can't wait to see what he directs next!"
"2252","Motherless Brooklyn",8,"That was pretty darn good!","I went into this not expecting much but Edward Norton gave till it hurt.
Overall, this was a great movie with some amazing performances by Norton and his fantastic ensemble cast. So well acted by such fine actors.
It's a very good murder mystery. That classic gum shoe style was done perfectly.
I love the art direction. He painted a great picture of 50s style New York.
And the music was stellar. Those jazz numbers really blended in perfectly with the atmosphere. Then I had that one piece of music made by Thom Yorke of Radiohead (you'll know it once you hear).
This was a really great movie."
"2253","Motherless Brooklyn",5,"Looks great and is well acted, but the pacing is turgid","Jonathan Lethem's 1999 novel Motherless Brooklyn may appear to be an old-fashioned private-eye noir, but in reality, it's about gentrification, institutionalised racism, political corruption, and how such things are woven into New York City's historical fabric. It's about how the city of today was built on the cruelty, prejudice, lies, and unchecked power of yesterday. The novel is a quintessentially postmodern narrative, fracturing the relationship between the physical and the temporal by taking the sensibilities of 1950s gumshoe noir and supplanting them into an end-of-century milieu. On the other hand, the 1957-set film is more literal, less interested in playing with form. Written for the screen, produced, directed by, and starring Edward Norton, this two-decades-in-the-making passion project asks how much corruption are we willing to forgive and whether truth and ideals even matter in a world in which there's a direct confluence between power and amorality. However, far too in reverence to films such as Chinatown (1974) and L.A. Confidential (1997), Motherless Brooklyn is never anything more than your average noir mystery - a likable but flawed protagonist begins what seems like a fairly straightforward investigation, only to be led down a rabbit hole of corruption and power games, until he's in the midst of an elaborate political conspiracy. And whilst it's aesthetically impressive (the period detail drips off the screen) and the acting is universally excellent, the film can be spectacularly on the nose and didactic. It also moves at a snail's pace, and Norton is never really able to generate any sense of urgency, making the whole thing feel laborious, and, ultimately, rather pointless.New York City, 1957. World War II veteran Frank Minna (Bruce Willis) runs a small PI firm staffed by men whom Minna rescued from an abusive orphanage when they were still children. He's most fond of Lionel Essrog (Norton), who suffers from what we know today as Tourette Syndrome, but who also has a photographic memory. As the film begins, Essrog is listening in on a clandestine meeting between Minna and unidentified parties. When the meeting becomes contentious, tragedy strikes, and although none of Minna's staff know who he was meeting or what he was investigating, Essrog determines to get to the bottom of the case, slowly unearthing a labyrinthine conspiracy involving local government, urban redevelopment plans, and housing relocation programs.Anyone familiar with the novel will recognise that Norton has made sweeping changes, not just in terms of relocating the story to 1957 (thus making explicit what was so indelibly postmodern in the book), but so too in terms of plot and character. The most significant addition is Moses Randolph (Alec Baldwin), a corrupt and powerful real estate magnate who's clearly based on New York's so-called ""master builder"" Robert Moses, the man largely responsible for the city's high-way infrastructure, the departure of the Brooklyn Dodgers to LA, the development of Long Island, and whose controversial philosophies regarding urban redevelopment continue to be implemented all over the world. Operating with almost complete autonomy from regulatory oversight, Moses was a narcissist obsessed with power, and an amoral , and so too is the character in the film. Indeed, although the film is ostensibly based on Lethem's novel, it contains more than a hint of Robert A. Caro's Pulitzer Prize-winning biography of Moses, The Power Broker: Robert Moses and the Fall of New York (1974).Motherless Brooklyn's most obvious strength is its aesthetic, about which I really can't say enough. Beth Mickle's production design, Michael Ahern's art direction and Amy Roth's costume design are all exceptional, contributing to the nuanced and immersive period-specific tone, with the milieu feeling lived-in and completely authentic.Norton's direction is, for the most part, straightforward and unfussy, but one visual motif he uses several times is shooting directly from Essrog's POV. First-person shots in cinema are infrequent enough that when a director uses the technique a few times, it stands out. What's most interesting here is when Norton uses it - three scenes in which Essrog is lying on his back either currently being beaten up, or having recently been beaten up. It's a nice (if somewhat unsubtle) directorial choice, drawing us directly into Essrog's experience, but only when he's at his most vulnerable. On the other hand, the tonally inconsistent use of dream scenes is far less effective, feeling as if they're from another film entirely.In terms of the decision to set the film in the 50s, it actually makes sense. One of the reasons the novel works so well is because the modern setting clashes with the mannerisms of the characters, the style of the dialogue, the cadences of the plot, all of which are straight out of classic 40s and 50s noir. The effect of this is quintessentially postmodern - a self-reflexive pastiche that's drawn from both the 50s and the 90s, and yet which belongs to neither. And although this works tremendously on the page, Norton argued (correctly, I think) that to try to replicate this on film - have the story set in 2019 (or even 1999), but told in the manner of a classic noir - wouldn't work, as it would send mixed and confusing messages to the audience.And so, he simply relocated the story to the time-period which underpins the style of the novel. With this in mind, the film features many of the trappings of classic noir - the world-weary private eye, the laconic voiceover speaking directly to the audience from an unspecified point in time, the seemingly important clues which ultimately lead nowhere, the seemingly irrelevant clues which ultimately lead somewhere, the smooth (so smooth) jazz score, the smoky (so smoky) jazz clubs, the chiaroscuro lighting (albeit very restrained), the antagonist who seems to see all, the political corruption. There's even a scene in which Essrog finds an address written on a pack of matches. About the only thing missing is a femme fatale, although there is a woman who may (or may not) know more than she's letting on.For all its thematic importance and laudable aesthetic aspects, however, I found Motherless Brooklyn disappointing. For one thing, there's the pacing, which is so lacking in forward-momentum that the story is practically somnolent. The narrative is unfocused and flabby, needing at least one more editorial pass, occasionally doubling back on itself and wasting time giving the audience information we already possess. Partly because of this, it's a good 20 minutes too long (at least), and much of it feels like padding - characters that do nothing, clues that lead nowhere, scenes which don't advance the story or develop the characters. I understand Norton wanted to let the material breath (the novel is around 300 pages), but there's a difference between giving the characters and themes room to develop and stalling for the sake of it, and so much of the film feels like the latter.There's also a significant disconnect between the politics and the detective story. In Chinatown, everything feels organic - the personal and the political are intertwined, with the political elements never feeling artificially shaped so as to fit a generic template, or the genre structure never feeling artificially bolstered with extraneous political elements. In Motherless Brooklyn, however, Norton is never really able to integrate the two, leading to a kind of identity crisis, with the film unable to find a comfortable middle ground - in trying to be both a noir mystery and a societal commentary, it ends up as neither. Another issue is that because the novel features 50s values displaced into the last years of the century, the endemic racism is deeply disturbing - society today is more enlightened about such things, but here's a novel in which characters are acting like it's 40 years prior despite being set in a modern milieu. This is a vital part of Lethem's postmodernist deconstruction of power structures. However, with the film set in the actual 1950s, the racism just comes across as period-appropriate window dressing, losing virtually all of its thematic potency.An old-fashioned detective story with a lot on its mind, Norton's passion for the material is self-evident. However, that passion hasn't translated into an especially good film. Void of almost any tension, although it looks great, Motherless Brooklyn fails to unify its genre elements and its political preoccupations, resulting in a film unsure of its own identity and unable to make us care about much of what it depicts."
"2254","Motherless Brooklyn",8,"Entertaining and Relevant","Motherless Brooklyn (opens Friday Nov 1)
My friend won advance screening tickets tonight for Motherless Brooklyn, which turned out to be a rather deluxe affair with wine and food served beforehand in the ""VIP"" cinema area of a cinema in Vancouver, Canada.We needn't have worried that all these emoluments were buttering us up for a bad movie-it's a really good one and likely to get Oscar nominations for Edward Norton, who not only stars as Lionel but also directs and co-wrote the screen adaptation from a novel. When I was grasping for the real world connection I thought I saw in this feature drama, my husband prompted me the sociopathic mogul, Moses Randolph, depicted by Alec Baldwin in the film is only a thinly papered over Robert Moses. That smasher of neighbourhoods in the name of grand schemes had a leading role in the 2016 documentary Citizen Jane: Battle for the City, about Jane Jacobs and her fight for the soul of New York City. (That soul, I'm hearing, has suffered some blows of late.)This 1950s period film has an instant classic feel to it. It has enough Hollywood dynamics and star power in it to pull in a larger audience but there's some very nice cinematography and lots of social relevance, both in the good old USA and in satellite nations like good old Canada, where I live, with regard to present-day politics and power-wielding at various levels by wealthy people. This is particularly the case when it comes to who runs city hall and gets to force out large numbers of people from the communities where they belong.The city where I live has an ongoing struggle for which Motherless Brooklyn has relevant things to say. Even as I travelled to the cinema in question, I was distracted by the ugliness of the rapid-transit corridor it sits on which has been heavily redeveloped since the line went in for the 2010 Winter Olympics. The construction cranes are still plentiful, the featureless higher density buildings lining the route have an oppressive, mountain-view blocking dominance. Robert Moses/Moses Randolph or whoever wears their snappy shoes would love it.Almost the only thing I was indifferent to in the film was the ""brain thing"" affliction of Norton's character, which seemed like some kind of cross between Tourette Syndrome, Obsessive Compulsive Disorder, and a revisiting of Dustin Hoffman's Rainman character, at times. The syndrome had relevance to the story, though, and there were some nicer moments in how it was depicted.In addition to Ed Norton's strong performance and Willem Defoe's decent contribution, I enjoyed seeing Michael Kenneth Williams as a mellow jazz musician (I always think of him as Omar in The Wire.) Alec Baldwin was convincingly evil, though I think some real life power mongers prettify their harsh decisions, to themselves and others."
"2255","Motherless Brooklyn",8,"I enjoyed it and recommend it","#MotherlessBrooklyn has the authenticity of a period piece like Road to Perdition combined with the corruption & intrigue of The Departed. Writer/director/actor Edward Norton paid homage to the classics in this movie. Featuring an All-Star cast, there was no way he could lose with the characters' performances. I think that is the one drawback of the film, with such a stellar cast he had to give everyone time and the movie boasts a runtime of 2:24 minutes. A bit lengthy for a crime drama/who done it because there will be slower portions of the film. However, it was never boring and the dialogue is spot-on with the snappiness of Sin City but it doesn't come across as a caricature. A very entertaining film and please don't be emo like me and cry after the opening scene."
"2256","Motherless Brooklyn",NA,"6/10 Chinatown Rehashed with Nice Cars","While this postmodern film noir goes to great lengths to set up and execute a somewhat over complicated mystery plot it really is not so hard to foresee most of the twists and turns. As if this film had been made before, minus a tourette ridden protagonist.The murders make little sense if you think about it - but then again the art direction is beautifully photographed and its fun to see Norton and an entourage of a few more movie stars appearing together one one film.I wish I would have liked it more and I wonder why it did not grab me. Maybe the term ""postmodern film noir"" is not the right way to describe it. Maybe they tried too hard to get there - somehow it did not pass the benchmark. Instead it sometimes felt like a few episodes of an online streaming series that hold your attention just enough to not walk out.This movie might have worked better if I had not seen Chinatown, a true classic and a somewhat similar mystery on many levels, in terms of story, music and acting."
"2257","Motherless Brooklyn",5,"An Extremely Tedious Passion Project","Motherless Brooklyn is the long awaited passion project from writer/director/star Edward Norton that tells the story of a NYC Private Investigator who with Tourette's who tries to solve the murder of his mentor. It is based off of the 1999 novel of the same name and after 20 years in development has finally made it to the big screen.Right off the bat Motherless Brooklyn boasts an incredible cast of A list actors including Bruce Willis, Willem Dafoe and Gugu Mbatha-Raw who all do a terrific job as well as our lead played by Edward Norton himself who manages to pull of this role of a man dealing with Tourette's flawlessly. If this was 1999 I could see him winning for best actor for sure.The movie is also wonderfully detailed. Norton manages to bring the 1950s to vibrant light through the costumes and the cars and the looks. The cinematography is also fantastic. It's a beautiful looking film managing to capture the 1950s perfectly on screen. However for me this is where most of the positives end.Motherless Brooklyn has problem with flat uninteresting characters and dialogue as well as a pace that moves incredibly slow you at times feel like your watching a 3 hours movie rather than a 2 hour 20 minute film. The films runtime and pacing completely destroy any excitement that could be found in the film.However, with some genuinely good acting beautiful cinematography and a committed performance from Edward Norton Motherless Brooklyn ends up being a very disappointing film with some good components throughout the rest of the mess."
"2258","Motherless Brooklyn",5,"would like better thing","Edward Norton there is on my list my favorite actors. Always I admire his diverse abilities on screen. Sorry but the movie Motherless Brooklyn has created no good impression because I think there is little action in the plot and the characters seem quite sluggish. Therefore, I will be waiting for new better works by director Edward Norton."
"2259","Motherless Brooklyn",8,"Incredible performance","Ed Norton does an amazing performance. Alec Baldwin was terrific!"
"2260","Motherless Brooklyn",5,"Not much of a film noir, more of a boring political hit job.","I'll start by saying I really like the cast. Ed Norton, William Defoe, Bruce Willis, even Alec Baldwin -- great foundation for a film noir. How can you go wrong? However, I struggled through the beginning of the movie. Although I tried and tried, it was really hard to shake the suspicion that Ed Norton was reprising his role of Brian from The Score, a ho-hum heist movie from the early 2000s. (""Okay, Bye Bye!"").Now a film noir involves a flawed hero, someone who's a little good, and a little bad. But here Lionel's (Norton's) flaw is simply Tourrete syndrome? What's next, Schizo Sal, a hard-as-nails PI who moonlights as a reluctant serial killer? (Hey, that one actually sounds kind of interesting!). Although a few of Lionel's Freudian outbursts were kind of funny, for the most part I found them irritating and distracting.And the underlying message of the movie, the obvious trashing (and basically doing a Trump job) on poor Robert Moses (Baldwin's character), a man responsible for getting done many of the major highways and most of the major bridge crossing in NYC? Verrazano, Whitestone, Thogs Neck, Triborough, and others -- without Moses the citizens of New York would probably STILL be riding over-priced river ferries to get INTO NYC, and then strugging through perpetual and nonstop gridlock in an endless maze of local roads. You think NYC is bad now?This movie is not so much a film noir, but more of a political hit job on Robert Moses, a man who led many of the practical efforts to modernize and clean up New York City in the early 20th century.Boooooring!"
"2261","Motherless Brooklyn",10,"IF","Edward Norton as Lionel Essrog was amazing, his Direction was just as great! One of the best films I've seen all year. I am a sucker for good film noir movies, Edward Norton, and a great cast. This movie had all of that. I was never board, In fact I had a fantastic time with my Dad and we both enjoyed it and I would definitely pre-order this for DVD, maybe even Blu-Ray; but first I'll have to buy a Blu-Ray player for that!"
"2262","Motherless Brooklyn",5,"Overlong- Give This A Miss!","Motherless BrooklynThere were several distinct problems with this movie and many good things.What was goodEdward Norton gave a strong and faultless acting performance as did the rest of the cast.The atmosphere of 50's New York and musical score was immensely evocative and comprehensively realised.What was problematicThe narrative drive ran out of steam as so much of the labyrinthine plot had similar repetitive scenes, it was unvarying.Overly long led to viewer exhaustion, of the 50 people in my viewing 20 had walked out by the 80 minute marker.The subject matter of municipal corruption, sibling jealousy and Tourette's syndrome was hardly designed to get the juices flowing.Ultimately it was overlong and repetitive it could have been so much better with some editing and some more action."
"2263","Motherless Brooklyn",10,"Great movie","This movie was great, well acted. Keeps you drawn in the whole time. Long but we enjoyed every minute."
"2264","Motherless Brooklyn",9,"Ed Norton's best","Interesting fast moving movie in the tradition of Chinatown. In fact Ed was as good as jack. Without spoilers it's dark, disturbing, slow at first but picks up speed. Excellent cinematography, great soundtrack, follows the Novel relatively faithfully. Not many good movies left anymore, this was one of a kind in the era of superhero's and green screen garbage. I loved it, and hate 90% of the garbage they put out, which of course means it will win no awards."
"2265","Motherless Brooklyn",8,"Tourette is Finally Depicted Responsibly","The first time I saw Tourette Syndrome portrayed in mainstream film was, as I imagine is the same for many others, in Deuce Bigalow. It wouldn't be the last time, however, that the portrayal was an exaggeration of coprolalia (the swearing tic), the shock value of which was used for a cheap and easy laugh.Over the years, I've seen that many people have presumptions about this neurological disorder - understandable, given the circumstances. Unfortunately, I've also learned the hard way that many of these presumptions have been heavily (and negatively) biased towards this inferred 'swearing tic', and I can't help but feel like Deuce Bigalow, or Not Another Teen Movie, or others, have helped shape this presumption.The presumption honestly doesn't bother me, provided the person holding the belief is willing to have a conversation with me about it. I've always been open about my Tourette, and I consider myself lucky and fortunate to have won awards, or spoken with the media, or inspired others, due to my openness and having some small success with writing and acting.What does get to me, though, is when the people aren't willing to have a conversation with me. I've been fired from jobs once it's become known that I have Tourette, even though it hasn't affected my work. I've had dates suddenly lose interest. I've been kicked out of bars when bouncers have mistaken my tics for drug use and refused to hear any explanation without threatening violence.So when I heard that Edward Norton would be portraying someone with Tourette Syndrome in #MotherlessBrooklyn, I was excited to see what an actor of such calibre would do with such a complex condition. And I was not disappointed.Motherless Brooklyn is great. Adapted from the novel and written and directed for the screen by Edward himself, the film is an enthralling and charming noir detective piece peppered with big names playing relatively small roles, all of whom tell a captivating story about government corruption in 1950s New York.Edward's presentation of Tourette Syndrome was refreshing. It was delivered with a level of maturity and respect that is seldom seen on the silver screen. And even though the condition is never outright named in the film, much like his tics, it can't be hidden from anyone watching.And yes, his character does have coprolalia, and echolalia (the tic where you have to repeat things said), and other verbal and motor tics. And sometimes it's funny. But his tics aren't just a cheap laugh for the audience - they affect his character. A PI trying to stay unnoticed on the subway who suddenly blurts out some choice words and draws attention to himself is funny. And when he's consoling someone and can't stop touching their shoulder, it's funny. And when they reassure him that it's okay, it's endearing.And it's okay for us to laugh at the realities of life, however absurd or uncontrollable they may be at times. Tourette Syndrome is real and sometimes it's funny and that's okay. But at least in this film, we're finally laughing at it for the right reasons. And with his portrayal, which also shows some of the positives that can come with Tourette - as opposed to just the obviously stare-inducing drawbacks - I am hopeful that this may help provide the less-aware with a better, more informed presumption about this condition.Are there actors out there with Tourette Syndrome (and who are open about it) that could have played this role? Absolutely. Like me. But I'm not Edward Norton. And are there actors out there with Tourette Syndrome (and closeted about it) that could have played this role? Absolutely. But they are also not Edward Norton.The issue of roles going to actors who don't live with the condition being portrayed has been a hot-button issue for many, and I do think there are instances where the role should have gone to someone else. This isn't one of those times. Actors are actors, after all - their job is to convince you that they're not pretending.Edward was convincing. And I - and I imagine a number of others with Tourette Syndrome who have been subject to unfair or illegal treatment due, at least in part, to a sub-par late '90s movie - thank him for being so. I was fortunate enough to see this at TIFF this year, where he introduced the film. Had he stayed for a Q&A afterwards, I would have loved to have said this to him in person. But I doubt I am the first, and know I won't be the last, person to say this."
"2266","Motherless Brooklyn",10,"Really gripping","Really good story fantastic performance by bruce Willis and the rest of the cast it's a must watch"
"2267","Motherless Brooklyn",4,"Boroughtown","Employing at least half a dozen incidentals and characters from Chinatown (1973) Ed Norton saddled with a case of Tourettes channels Jack Nicholson's Jake Gittes in this overlong detective that supposedly takes place in the late 50s while borrowing liberally from other periods. Wearing many hats both literally and figuratively the auteur/director draws a split decision with his excellent choice in hats.Sam Spade's partner is whacked by triggermen who may be in the employ of legendary NY planning commissioner Robert Moses (Alec Baldwin) who is destroying black neighborhoods when Miles Davis (Michael Williams) comes to the rescue, kind of; the players are all very reasonable facsimiles. It makes for the film's greatest mystery, how do they pull it off without being sued?Norton's direction is sluggish as the film plods along with overlong scenes at a club and a pace killing heart to heart with the female lead. He even seems to sabotage his suspenseful moments by being repetitive in situations while his vintage autos convey an artificial look with their with showroom glow still in tact as they tool around Queens and Brooklyn. A smarmy, obnoxious music score does not help matters.Norton's tic is like a scratch on an album you're expecting after a few listens as he overloads scenes with introspective close-ups of himself, the film's meter running into overtime. Baldwin as the bellicose Moses blowing smoke through his nose is all flat bluster. Wilhelm DaFoe playing his brother is a hammy crank while the rest of the cast looks dull, acts depressed. Motherless Brooklyn is a moody mess."

"2270","Motherless Brooklyn",1,"Too long and predictable","I love Ed Norton as an actor but I would suggest he never direct again. This movie is way too long and too predictable and the camera angles are trying hard to be artsy but fail."
"2271","Motherless Brooklyn",5,"Reverse holistic, the sum of the parts is less than it should be.","Ed Norton worked long and hard to transform a very good novel into a workable screenplay. Then he directed and starred. He is a talented man and you could see he had a story to tell. His story overlaid the novel, which he ""adapted."" He changed the setting to suit his story. If you're ""woke"" you should like it. It's twisted and bent to deliver a a priori message. Pedantic? Didactic? Powerful men like Trump and Robert Moses destroy the little guy to help the big guys. The little guys are women and minorities. The smartest person in the room is partially disabled. The bad guy has to be squashed by the woman, who is a minority. I sat though it. It was flat. The novel was exciting, interesting, unique and fun to read. The movie was none of these things. The message doesn't bother me. There's some truth there. And Norton is multi-talented and me critiquing his work is ludicrous. I have no such talent. So my opinion should only be taken at face value. As a consumer, I was disappointed in the movie because it lacked all the excitement of the novel. Because I understand a little history, I got the Moses references. And it has elements similar to ""Chinatown"" which is a great classic of cinema. I like film noir. I am glad I saw it because I would have been disappointed if I hadn't. But boy, could it use an injection of adrenaline, humor, heightened drama, improved soundtrack and less forced woke messaging.Read the book."
"2272","Motherless Brooklyn",5,"Last Exit to Brooklyn","I remember hearing about Motherless Brooklyn 10, 15 years ago when reading some interview with Edward Norton. This story about a private eye with Tourette's was supposed to be his next film and it sounded intriguing, so I kept an eye out for it for a long time afterwards but then it never appeared and eventually I forgot about it.It turns out Norton never did, and many years later finally got the go-ahead to write and direct it himself. The sad news is that, having carried his pet project for so very long, the end result is stale, uninspired, rushed and reeking of last-chance desperation. It so obviously wants to be Chinatown, or maybe LA Confidential, but never even once approaches that level of excellence, and feels instead like a quickie made-for-TV movie with a surprisingly high number of famous faces in walk-on cameos. Few of the actors seem like they fully inhabit their parts, and most look like they are briefly taking time out from some other, better paying film as a favour to Norton, although Michael Kenneth Williams acquits himself pretty well.None of the emotional or romantic scenes convince, they seem to be there simply because the story requires it, and even Norton himself seems hurried and distracted, presumably because of his needing to watch the clock as both director and star. His Tourette's tics become annoying pretty fast and never seem like something his character is continually struggling with but rather obligatory beats necessary for maintaining character that appear when conveniently scripted. Around half the lines he speaks begin with the word 'sorry', which also begins to grate.I feel bad making such harsh criticisms, since it's a film I really wanted to like, that I fully expected was going to be a modern film noir classic. And I guess, really, this is just me trying to figure out why it didn't turn out that way.I think, mostly, it was because of all the time that elapsed: whatever was special about the initial spark of the novel was lost or rubbed off somewhere along the way, and all the many things added and changed - the period setting, the historical and racial politics - just make it more messier and meaningless. I get the feeling this was a film that Edward Norton made in his head many times over, many years ago, and that this final product is a half-hearted cover version of that platonic ideal. There's a tired, routine mood to the proceedings, no-one seems excited or alive in their parts, everyone just going through the motions in service of nothing very memorable at all.A great film feels like a sumptious three course meal, but unfortunately this one just tastes like reheated leftovers."
"2273","Motherless Brooklyn",2,"Take your pillow with you.","The esthetics and styling of this movie were great, that's what the 2 stars are for. The movie was painfully boring with hardly any story line and 2hours 35 mins long that felt like 4 hours. Ed Norton directed , wrote the screenplay and acted. Sorry Ed you are not that talented. I really got tired of looking at his face in every scene, and his mediocre acting in this movie. Don't forget to take your pillow if by any chance you want to go to see this movie, you may catch a good snooze."
"2274","Motherless Brooklyn",10,"Magical experience","One of the best films of the year! A comforting thrill ride with very well written dialogue, ambient soundtrack, and beautiful cinematography! I have been fan of Edward Norton for a long time and for good reason he's incredible in every scene. This is one of the best performances of Alec Baldwin and Willem Defoe. I respect people with Tourette syndrome being that I have ASD So I feel I relate to some extent. Last thing is I really hope Motherless Brooklyn gets nominated or better win something."
"2275","Motherless Brooklyn",2,"Not bad... not believable. Nothing special.","Not a single stranger that first come across Mr. Tourette's handles it other than accepting? Give me a break. It is not realistic to think that not a single person would have reacted differently to someone approaching the way Mr. Tourette's does. It is just not believable and takes away from the movie.The movie had potential, but seems like nothing special compared to others in the genre."

"2280","Motherless Brooklyn",1,"Slow, boring, and unrealistic","This movie is so slow, so boring, with a terrible score and a heavy handed approach, and worst of all, unrealistic in the portrayal of the characters and how they talk and react, more than anything to the protagonist.
It's just a terrible movie, besides the good intentions (a protagonist with a mental disorder that isn't dangerous or ""crazy"" for shock value only, denouncing the very real institutional racism, political corruption, etc.).The main problem, I believe, is the direction and the tone. There is no tension. The tourette syndrome breaks the tension every three minutes. But half the time it is not used for laughs as the movie progresses, and is not really a deep exploration of the problems it creates with other people. But then half the time it is used for laughs, but it is just not funny, because that's not the tone of the movie. And sometimes the jokes are funny in theory, but the editing or acting just doesn't let them land. With no tension, no score, a slow pace, a PG-13 script taking away realism from the characters and their reactions and dialogues, and failed and intermittent attempts of comedy, this is a failure in every sense.Horrible, horrible film."

Apart of the appeal of following a private investigator is you get to uncover the mystery with them but I could see some twist 40 minutes prior or they just fall flat. Him have Tourette's probably work a lot better in a book version but in the movie it cuts the tension and seems more humorist then it should be"
"2284","Motherless Brooklyn",5,"Something's Missing Here","Something's missing in, and about, 'Motherless Brooklyn'. A great cast, a likable lead, true-to-the-period (Fifties) cinematography. But somehow the film misses.The story is Polansky's 'Chinatown' reset in New York City in The Fifties. Both involve big-city power and greed. Instead of water being the treasure worth fighting over, in 'Motherless' it's real estate (and a thinly veiled Robert Moses' attempts to grab it all). In both films we've got a private eye attempting to unravel the maze of deception. In both films there's a woman in trouble, in both films the question of parentage plays a large role. So then why does Chinatown work while Motherless doesn't?1. Gugu Mbatha-Raw as the film's damsel in distress; she's wooden. I'm sorry, but that's true.
2. Edward Norton's hero Lionel. He suffers from Tourettes Syndrome. He is full-time tics and shrugs and out-of-control shouts. The question is, What does this add to the story? The answer, Not one thing.
3. Edward Norton as Director. The film feels flabby, slow, unsure of its pacing. The story is too far in the background, the number of characters too many, given that few of them make a difference in the story's resolution.I brought a lot of good will to the viewing. I'm a big Ed Norton fan. Likewise Alec Baldwin and Willem Defoe. Likewise Bobby Canavale and Bruce Willis. A lot of good will. I wanted it to work.It didn't."
"2285","Motherless Brooklyn",4,"Too long, caricature acting","The book was pretty good, this movie adaptation, not so much. It was too long and they took too many ""artsy"" liberties. The movie was at least 45min too long. Not impressed with Ed Norton's depiction of tourette's syndrome. It pains me to say that because I love Norton as an actor. To be fair, I got pretty tired of it in the book as well. It was a novel idea(pardon the pun), but it took away from the plot line, which was so convoluted, that I stopped trying to keep up with it. What they deem to be artistic license, I see as caricatures of the 50s. Fell asleep a few times"
"2286","Motherless Brooklyn",3,"First Hit: Meandering and unfocused attempt to bring this Jonathan Lethem novel to life on the big screen.","First Hit: Meandering and unfocused attempt to bring this Jonathan Lethem novel to life on the big screen.Screenwriter, Director, and Actor Edward Norton failed to make this an engaging crime thriller in the tradition of Roman Polanski's ""Chinatown."" Although there were aspects of this film, I thought exquisite, for instance the jazz club scenes were exceptional as were the scenes in Moses Randolph's office, generally it felt long and tired.One way it felt tired to me was me having to analyze scenes to see if things were making sense as the film moved along. Often, they didn't, which is tiring. For instance, a few early scenes in the Minna Detective Agency office were confusing, and I found myself questioning how the agency made any money, had pleasantly nice offices, and everybody in the office seemed flush, not struggling. There were hints that people in the agency drove people around in cars for a fee and that this was a side business, but everyone at the agency always seemed to be in the office and sitting at their desks doing nothing. I kept thinking, how did all four guys in the agency make money. The main character Lionel Essrog (Edward Norton), always seemed to have money to buy drinks with lavish tips, pay for taxis, and buy dinner or two for meetings with other people.These and other logic questions kept popping up in my mind as the film wore on and took me away from engaging more with the story.Basically, the story is about Lionel's dedication to his boss and friend Frank Minna (Bruce Willis). Because Frank gets shot and killed early in the story, Lionel has to find out who did it. He cannot let go of the puzzle in his head, which is where his being afflicted with Tourette's Syndrome adds to the plot. He's always blurting out comments at an inopportune time, but it helps him to drive to answers to open questions.The trail to find his boss's killer begins from a hint Frank whispered to Lionel just before his death in the hospital from a gunshot wound that Lionel witnessed.The hint has to do with a woman, Laura Rose (Gugu Mbatha-Raw), who un-be-knowingly was fathered by a powerful city politician Moses Randolph (Alec Baldwin). Although he's never in an elected spot, he's always be chosen to run the public parks, building commission, and the housing commission. This is where the real power of control over the city lies.The audience sees his bullying ways in an early scene when he storms into the Mayor's office and demands to have all the commissions he had before recent the election.Randolph has a genius brother, Paul (Willem Dafoe), whom he keeps on a short leash and on the edge of hope. Paul figures into the story because Lionel interviews him and learns more about his controlling brother Moses.I can say that I spent 2 ½ hours watching some good scenes with some excellent acting sprinkled in along the way. However, the meandering nature of the movie and overly complicated scenes to achieve a visible result were not well-intentioned.Norton was at times good as Lionel, but somehow his expression of the syndrome became part of the distraction versus adding to the film and story. It's a difficult thing to do, and at times it failed. Willis' small but pivotal part was good while it lasted. Mbatha-Raw was outstanding as Rose. Her ability to be both strong and vulnerable was effectively used. Baldwin was the best of the bunch in this film. Without any doubt he brought the role of powerful non-elected city politician to life. His conversation with Lionel about the importance of building his future dream city was wonderfully done. Dafoe gives a reliable performance as the younger brother of Moses. He's continually seeking approval for his work, and subsequent disappointment was exquisitely displayed towards the end of the story when he opens an envelope, filled with hope, only to find something else. For me one of the most compelling scenes was between Lionel and Trumpet Man (Michael Kenneth Williams). While in Trumpet Man's home, he and Lionel talk about their respectively messed up heads and how they each try to soothe their inner beasts, watching Williams's performance, I was transfixed. Norton both wrote and directed this film. The direction of his own performance needed work. He seemed too engaged with watching himself where trimming his screen time might have helped the film by being more focused. However, he does has directorial talent and was able to evoke several powerful scenes by letting the talent shine.Overall: I can say that I spent 2 ½ hours watching some good scenes with some excellent acting sprinkled in a long, meandering, and overly complicated moments to achieve an obvious result."

His enactment of the tics and mannerisms of a Tourette patient is a treat to watch and a testament to the immense acting chops of the 3-time Academy Award Nominee.But alas, Norton really does a mediocre job as a director, stretching his narration with unwanted plot points and many scenes that could have been avoided. He fails to leverages impactful performances from power houses like Willem Dafoe and Alec Baldwin.

It's like a jigsaw puzzle where pieces that don't quite fit are forced together. The otherwise excellent layers sit on top of each other like oil and water, instead of being perfectly blended. The incompatibility of it all starts to get distracting, no matter how good the acting might be. The final straw is how the villain reveals his true nature. At best it's a five star film. It's ok while you're watching, but afterwards it's annoying to remember the flaws."
"2291","Motherless Brooklyn",6,"""Chinatown"" sideways and slow","First, kudos to Edward Norton for writing, directing and starring in this movie. The screenplay is great, and his performance - as usual - is marvelous, while his direction (while effective enough) is still developing and the 45-day shooting schedule shows. I agree with what others have stated about the cinematography; it is very well done and captures the era. Bruce Willis is the Janet-Leigh-in-""Psycho"" here with a short part which is vital to the story. The rest of the cast are fabulous as well, though I wanted to see more motivation for Alec Baldwin's character: I never ""got"" what made him tick.On the downside, it felt like some sort of homage to ""Chinatown"" turned on its ear, but I suppose any story involving private investigators looking into nefarious big business deals with crooked politicians and women of unusual parentage would warrant such a comparison. My biggest gripe is the pacing. The unfolding of the story zips slong at the blistering pace of a ""Zooptopia"" DMV employee on a gallon of NyQuil. Some judicious editing would probably broaden the appeal of this movie. All that stated, it certainly is worthy of a viewing; just make sure you are wide awake."
"2292","Motherless Brooklyn",7,"Fairly Flawless Film. Worth Your Time...Maybe.","To be fair, Edward Norton's screenwriting and directing was top notch in terms of the general acting and performance of everyone involved. It's worth seeing, but as I said, ""maybe"", only because it's a slow burn and could've been accelerated in spots. The jazz in the club was great as was the authenticity of the neighborhoods. I recommend this film principally on the care that went into its development and Norton's accurate portrayal of someone suffering with Tourette's. Other than that, if you see it, that's nice. If not, no biggie."
"2293","Motherless Brooklyn",1,"Pointless","The storyline is boring as hell. The plot of the movie sucks. In short does not worth it."
"2294","Motherless Brooklyn",2,"Yawn fest","I wanted to leave half way through. It wasn't entertaining and the Jazz music was so annoying, almost every scene had Jazz playing....The story picked up for the last half, but only enough not to leave. Skip it."
"2295","Motherless Brooklyn",2,"BOORING! Left wing Hollywood hit job on Robert Moses","Let me begin by stating two facts. I am a 60-year old man with Tourette syndrome who grew up in New York City. That being said, I am divided about this movie. On one hand it has four fatal flaws. The most notable is that the Tourette syndrome angle brings nothing to the film and is more a distraction than anything else. In other words, the film would likely have been a little better without the Tourette angle. As someone with Tourette, and someone with both a brother and child who have Tourette, I can also state that I was not happy with the way Norton portrayed someone with Tourette syndrome as his portrayal simply perpetuated a false stereotype. The word association for instance, which was portrayed accurately in the book, is something we think in our head but do not verbalize. That being said, there was also some truth, like the fact that the majority of people with Tourette have compulsive obsessive disorder. It was also nice to see Norton's character show that Tourette is not a mental disease but a physical one. Hence, the two star rating instead of only one star.The three other fatal flaws were: 2. The moving was so boooring! It was so boring that I fell asleep half way through watching it in the early evening. This made me wonder, how can a movie with such great actors be so bad? This brings us to the third fatal flaw. 3. The movie was written and directed by Edward Norton. Norton is obviously a brilliant actor, but his is obviously a horrible writer and director. Ed - stick to acting please. The last fatal flaw was the obviously politically left-wing driven agenda of the movie to trash Robert Moses, who wasn't even in the book on which this movie is based. To set the record strait, Robert Moses did not rape a woman and Robert Moses made New York City what is it today (yes believe it or not life in New York would be even more miserable - even for minorities - had Moses not modernized the city). As far as the parks are concerned, Moses gave up his own land to create many of them. Furthermore, Moses lived in the slums that he purportedly destroyed. So, he didn't call them slums because there were minorities, he called them slums because he lived there and saw it for himself. When it comes to eminent domain, it is clear that highways, bridges, fall under that statute. So, this movie had no right to trash Moses for doing what the law allows. If this movie wanted to trash anyone, then it should have gone after Bobby Brown; who's unrelenting efforts to build the Metro-Center stadium and Mall in Brooklyn displaced hundreds (if not thousands) of minorities to convert their neighborhoods into rich-white Yuppie heaven. Let's see, Moses Taylor used eminent domain to build roads and bridges and Brown (along with the New York Politicians who put his plan into place) used eminent domain to build a stadium and shopping mall. Hmmm, I wonder why Norton didn't go after Brown instead. Oh , now I know, it's because Brown is a rich black left winger, and Hollywood only targets rich white right wingers. The movie would have been better if it just left politics out by portraying Moses as who he really was or at least not building their villein as a parallel to Moses. Even so, it would not have been much better thanks to the other three fatal flaws."
"2296","Motherless Brooklyn",9,"This one is definitely worth seeing","Somewhere between the noir and French film categories Motherless Brooklyn exists, and I truly enjoyed watching it. Norton gave a very interesting preformance in this film and if nothing else it's a great character study based on the choices he decided to go with to portray his character. The long scenic film backed by the low calming jazz music creates such a cool setting for the film and makes it so easy to get lost in the world that has been created by the film. It's understandable that this story might not appeal to everyone but I enjoyed it immensely."
"2297","Motherless Brooklyn",4,"Film Noir ? Not so much!","I watched Chinatown on TCM the other night and frankly was blown away by it for a variety of reasons. After the film Norton was on and talked about the film, his admiration and about his own upcoming film. In the week that followed he subsequently was on almost every podcast I listen to. Ultimately, my curious peaked and after reading the names of the cast members and the plot that was outlined I went to see it.
On the merits, I would have to say that Norton's film was ambitious and very timely, but casting it as film noire, I'm not certain. In my opinion, the film lack the subtlety that I associate with the genre. The characters were not far too cartoonish and lacked depth. I was particularly disappointed with Alec Baldwin's performance, who I admire greatly, but lacked any nuance in his portrayal.
In conclusion, the film is clearly a homage to Polanski's ""Chinatown"", with a variety of scenes that were directly drawn from it and a plot that was equally convoluted and focused on unfettered power. Norton's film seem far too long, his character's malady was honesty distracting and unfortunately most of the characters were remarkably familiar."
"2298","Motherless Brooklyn",6,"Simple story made complicated.","Edward Norton is one of my favourite actors. He directed this movie too. To take the role of being a Tourette's Sydrome patient, he should make reference to the 2008 movie Front of the Class. Jimmy Wolk did a better job in my opinion."
"2299","Motherless Brooklyn",5,"Sorry Norton, but stick to acting","It's to the actors' great credit that this was bearable to watch. Poorly written and directed. There's no imagination in the way scenes play out.. The editing is sometimes strange during conversations, not showing you much needed reactions at key moments. Most characters are surprisingly one-dimensional. No one more so than the bad guy, played by Alec Baldwin, who is introduced in a strange way by not showing his face, as if to build up tension (like Alec Baldwin is a bigger deal than he actually is?). I could go on about every detail that bothered me with this film, but in a nutshell it just feels like a passion project by an actor who is merely playing at writing and directing. It's great for Edward Norton that he got to make this film with all his friends, but less so for the audience."
"2300","Motherless Brooklyn",5,"Well intended but overly long and surprisingly flat-footed","""Motherless Brooklyn"" (2019 release; 144 min.) brings the story of Lionel, a Brooklyn private investigator suffering from Tourette Syndrome. As the movie opens, Lionel is in a car with a colleague, as they await instructions from their boss Frank Minna regarding a stake-out. The bad guys show up, and before we know it, they drive off with Frank, and Lionel and his colleague are in hot pursuit. They lose track and by the time they catch up, Frank has been shot and left for dead... Why was Frank shot? Who were those bad guys? At this point we are 10 min. into the movie but to tell you more of the plot would spoil your viewing experience, you'll just have to see for yourself how it all plays out.Couple of comments: this movie is a labor of love from Edward Norton, who directed, produced, wrote the script (based on Jonathan Lethem's book), and stars as Lionel. The movie was in development hell for YEARS and that Norton finally was able to make it, is a tribute to his persistence and patience. I didn't read the underlying book and hence can't comment how closely the film sticks to the book. Now for the not so good: the movie, set in the 1950s, plays out as a film noir-wanna be (with correlating photography and musical score), and should create a lot of tension and drama. Alas, none of that happened and I was surprised how flat-footed the movie was. I never felt emotionally invested in any of the characters. And what it the plot's big picture? It took forever to take shape, and then it took another forever to play out. In other words, the movie runs far too long (2 1/2 hrs, maybe 40-45 min. too long) for its own good. Norton gives a good performance as the Tourette Syndrome suffering PI, but how many times can one apologize for suffering from Tourette? (Lionel apologizes, literally, dozens of times throughout the movie.) Bruce Willis, who gets second billing, has less than 10 min. of screen time in the entire movie. Alec Baldwin, Leslie Mann and Willem Dafoe also have small roles. One of the very best aspects of the movie is the score, courtesy of versatile and rapidly up-and-coming composer Daniel Pemberton. On top of that, Thom Yorke contributes a new song (""Daily Battles"", it also plays prominently in the movie's trailer).""Motherless Brooklyn"" premiered at this year's Telluride film festival to positive acclaim. The movie was released wide the weekend before last, with mixed box office results. I finally went to see it this weekend, and the Sunday afternoon screening where I saw this at here in Cincinnati was attended okay (about 15 people). The audience applauded when the movie's end credits started rolling. I can't say that I shared the audience's feeling. If you are in the mood to check out a film noir-wanna be that is a bit overly long for its own good (and in my view surprisingly flat-footed), I'd suggest you check this out, be it in the theater, on VOD, or eventually on DVD/Blu-ray, and draw your own conclusion."
"2301","Motherless Brooklyn",7,"Great Acting","Edward Norton has Tourette's Syndrome, which comes out when he is stressed, which does not include driving a car, or getting into a gunfight or walking into a strange location when you expect them to kill you. He works for Bruce Willis, who runs a detective agency out of Brooklyn. Willis gets kidnapped and shot, so Norton is the man in the shop who is supposed to track down the killer. This leads him on a tour of an alternate 1956 New York City, which seems to be populated by great actors like Willem Dafoe, Gugu Mbatha-Raw, Cherry Jones, Bobby Cannavale and Alec Baldwin as a megalomaniac closely modeled on Robert Moses. One of them is the bad guy. Guess which and why.... I had it figured out four minutes before Norton did, but then, I don't have Tourette's. Still, that means it's a fair mystery.... not who, but why.Mostly, though, it's a chance for actors to strut their stuff, and none more so than Norton, who besides having Tourette's has an eidetic memory, smokes pot to control his symptoms, and will never be rich. No one seems to be put off by his tics, including touching women, making comments which are mildly lewd, making noises while jazz musicians play, and in one scene where he is trying to light a lady's cigarette, repeatedly lighting a match and blowing it out before it can get to the cigarette. Everyone is astonishingly enlightened, except, of course, Baldwin. Being evil, he hates poor people, and Blacks in particular.Good acting, but when I want to visit 1956 New York City, I don't want everyone there to be from 2019. Still, some great acting, some great locations, and the CGI recreation of Penn Station revives my anger towards the morons who tore it down."
"2302","Motherless Brooklyn",5,"Is anyone this movie really from new york","This is my problem with this movie all very La not new york . Its a well shot movie but quite boring and long . Very disappointed tbh ."
"2303","Motherless Brooklyn",6,"Tedious Exercise","No, this film noir failure should not have been 2 hours and 29 minutes. Good acting, confusing story and sketchy directing made this potential good film into a disaster. There were periods of lengthy segments that put me to sleep. Avoid this one."
"2304","Motherless Brooklyn",5,"Over-Directed/Edited Nice Try","Norton did a decent job with the complex, noirish script adaptation, and his performance of the irritating character is fine. All acting just fine. No one rises above. The plot is convoluted and overly-ambitious, without a satisfying resolution. But the real problem here is emotional investment and payoff, which is hindered by the chronic insistence by Norton to inject his presence into the film via quick edits to multiple camera angles, zoom shots, quick pans, & odd perspective shots, until you'd rather be watching 1950s TV than all this razzmatazz. Definitely feels like Norton was trying too hard at the helm, and it gets in the way of falling into a nice flow/vibe that might have otherwise invested you in the dense, unraveling story."
"2305","Motherless Brooklyn",2,"2 hours 24 minutes too long","It's clear what they were going for but sadly missed the mark completely. Even a star studded cast couldn't rescue it. Actually all the stars in the galaxy couldn't save this one. It's substandard weak offerings like this that could render a genre extinct. I figured out half the mystery after 10 minutes and the other half wasn't worth the speculation. The only way to make this bearable would be by being motherlessly drunk when watching it, but even then you would probably nod off halfway through."
"2306","Motherless Brooklyn",4,"Slow, political statement piece","This movie was so slow and very boring. It covered all of the woke issues of the day."
"2307","Motherless Brooklyn",6,"A lot of Potential, but somewhat Failed Execution","Motherless Brooklyn is a film that generally had a lot of things going for it such as: Great performances all round, especially from Edward Norton as a detective with tourettes, great cinematography, Costumes that engage you with the time and place that the film is set, and authentic production design. These elements are all excellent and shows that Edward Norton is a capable director who makes something with effort and passion which isn't seen all the time, these aspects feel so engaging in the first act and through many parts of the final act. These elements show that he has a lot of potential and I can't wait to see what he directs next.However, the film has a lot of issues which unfortunately bring it down, the film is way too long for the type of film that it is, a Noir detective drama/thriller such as this had enough content to go for an hour and a half, however the film exceeds two and a half hours making it feel like a drag to get through especially in the second act. The film also tried to cover a lot of things and moments that seemed to weigh down the quality of the film, and make me feel confused for a number of moments and revelations. These could have been more impactful with a shorter run time and tighter plot lines that give the audience a meaningful connection to the characters and the actions they set to do throughout the film.Overall, Motherless Brooklyn is a film that had a lot of potential and showcased a number of promising aspects of Edward Norton as a director, however, a messy second act, a stretched run time, and too much expository dialogue rather than use visual storytelling weigh the film down and decrease its quality making it tough to get through at times, fans of this genre will find something to love here but its far from being a fantastic film."

"2309","Motherless Brooklyn",NA,"Somewhat engaging","The film is somewhat engaging, but the detective's medical condition is slightly distracting. I'm glad that the film's characters are sympathetic towards his condition, but they seem to be a little overwhelmingly sympathetic that it becomes a little unrealistic in the world back then."
"2310","Motherless Brooklyn",2,"Hmmm bit overrated","Edward Norton was good but the film didn't capture me, I turned it off after 30 mins, this is the second film in my entire life that I didn't finish , it was clear from the start that it would be a overly long dragged out tedious story"
"2311","Motherless Brooklyn",NA,"the times they are a change'in","Poor Ed Norton. He's so desperate for an Oscar, but doesn't realize the path to getting one is so very different since his nomination for AHX. He's trapped in that mentality of thinking the way to get the nom and the win is to play a person with mental or physical handicaps...or both. That's not how you win in 2020, boomer. It's 100% about politics, now. You have to be the right shade and of the correct political party. Being seen as a victim also helps. These things are what matter. Sad to see him trapped in 1999. Do better."
"2312","Motherless Brooklyn",2,"Didn't like it","Dull, uninteresting. The story flows with no suspance. Annoying noir-ish soundtrack that helps building an unwarranted grotesque tone."
"2313","Motherless Brooklyn",8,"A biitersweet tale as Homeless finds a home.","Adapting Jonathan Lethem novels for the scrren, Edward Norton's Ivy League pettigree is put to good use, in adapting the script with Lethem for the screen.
'Homeless Brooklyn' is highly entertaining, although a mishmash of themes that are loose threads of a sprawling story, albeit well told.Norton as Lionel Essrog, aflawed hero with Tertz Syndrome, yet endowed with perfect pitch of a memory that forget nothing; a restless mind that stitches together a murder with mumbled clues.
Set in Brooklyn in the 1950s, in a New York that Robert Moses is transforming a New York that feeds his autocratic inclination, as the power ebhind the throne. The indiscriminate use of eminent domain, to class and ethnic cleansing the working poor, the blacks and the Puerto Ricans, without providing them with places to go.
The villain is Moses (or Moe) Randolph, a not so veiled character that is modeled on Robert Moses, and played well by Alec Baldwin.
Murder, greed, sibling rivalry and trachery, mafia-like tactics, adultery, corruption, tape, jazz, taut racial relation, resistance from below and the stone=willed determination of Norton to solve the disparate pieces of this puzzle that is 'Homeless Brooklyn'.
A sure fire cast with cameos by Cherry Jones, Wilhem Dafoe, Gugu Mbata-Raw, Michael Kenneth and the splendid Bruce Willis.
144 minutes fly by at a fast clip. Brooklyn or what appears to be Brooklyn is well used as a back ground. 'Homeless Brooklyn' speaks to the politics of our day, nonetheless the moral of justice is frayed in a jagged pattern. The camera is a good eye in capturing the narrative in close ups, medium and wide shorts."
"2314","Motherless Brooklyn",5,"BEAUTIFUL, SLOW RHYTHM AND POTENTIALLY MORE","Motherless Brooklyn gives us all confirmation that Edward Norton is not only a great actor, but a also a farsighted director, with his own style and his own vision of the plot. The problem is where to combine all these pieces of a greater puzzle and it's here where Edward Norton fails a bit. The film is a continuosly going up and down with a slow, rigid pace and a story that could have been shorter but more intense, apart from the amazing cast and its brilliant acting. Despite everything and a bit of confusion, there is a huge potential in Norton's direction / writing (not to mentiong the impeccable acting) and this movie was the proof."
"2315","Motherless Brooklyn",5,"Ed Norton should stick to acting.","At a glance this is usually the kind of movie I would usually love. Great cast, great story, pretty good design, very good music. However, there were certain scenes and directions I thought were simply bad. All the acting was pretty top notch, but I don't think it was that well. I was never bored but I think the story could have been told a little better.
Just for the record I think Ed Norton is a brilliant actor, just maybe not so much of a director"
"2316","Motherless Brooklyn",5,"Beautiful from the outside, but broken from the inside","This film had every right to be an excellent film. This project was Edward Norton's baby. He was committed to this project for almost 20 years, the book is apparently amazing and the story itself sounds somewhat decent. But, something unfortunately went wrong.So, from the director, producer, actor, and writer Edward Norton comes a story about a private detective who has Tourette's syndrome. As he's investigating one particular case of murder, he becomes more and more involved, and he starts to risk everything that he has.
Despite an interesting premise and all the commitment behind the film, it didn't end up being good. The biggest issue of the film is that it's way too long. It has a runtime of almost 2 hours and 30 minutes. There are so many unnecessary scenes that only dragged the pacing of the film and which didn't contribute to anything. You could easily trim about 30 minutes of the film and almost nothing would change. The only thing that would change is that the film would be more concise. Furthermore, Norton should've given the screenwriting job to someone else because the script was very bad. All the characters were underdeveloped and the whole film in the general was unfocused. The film very often switched focus between many characters, but the thing is that most of them weren't interesting at all. They were just a caricatures which only had one character trait throughout the whole film, and that's it. E.g. Bruce Willis' character had only one purpose in the film, and that was being the role model to Norton's character; Baldwin was a bad guy; Dafoe was a shady, mysterious guy; Gugu Mbatha-Raw was a love interest. It's unfortunate because all of them are terrific actors and they didn't have any material to work with. Regarding the script, Norton used narration and exposition a lot, and the worst thing is that he milked both. If there wasn't any exposition laid out in the narration, he would use it a couple of minutes later to explain the simplest things which didn't need any explanation. Instead of doing pointless exposition, the film could've given more development to the relationship between Norton's and Willis' character. Every 5 minutes Norton talks about him and how he's a huge influence on him. I wish they built some grounds for those statements because they seemed shallow. You didn't have any reason whatsoever to understand/believe why exactly Willis was Norton's idol. And because of that, all those monologues fell short.Despite all those negative aspects, for some unknown reason, I was sucked in into the world which film presented. That was achieved through aesthetics. The production design was beautiful and it was delightful to look at all those set pieces. Especially, if you're a huge fan of Once Upon a Time in America and films similar to that one, you're going to love the locations and the time period in which this film took place in. The costumes were great and they definitely contributed to achieve a noir ""homage"". It's actually impressive how well the atmosphere was built despite the bland script. If the actors weren't great as they were, the film would lose a lot in its quality. Norton was fantastic and he was definitely one of the standouts from this film. If it was marketed and promoted better, and maybe if the film received a better reception from the critics, he would be in competition for an Oscar. Bruce Willis gave the second acceptable performance in this year, and Baldwin and Dafoe were decent but their charisma was completely wasted.When you combine all those positive and negative aspects you'll get an atmospheric and beautiful film from the outside, but unfortunately, from the inside this film ended up being rotten."
"2317","Motherless Brooklyn",1,"Normally strong actors overacting.","I can only give an impression of the first 14 or so minutes. That is as long as I could stand to watch."
"2318","Motherless Brooklyn",4,"Long and boring.","Motherless Brooklyn (2 out of 5 stars).Motherless Brooklyn is a boring neo noir crime film which Edward Norton delivers a great performance. His direction, script, and tone of the movie is so dull and boring. You might want to get comfy cause its long run time does make the movie feel like forever.The plot is about a private investigator Lionel (Edward Norton) who has Tourette's syndrome. When his partner Frank (Bruce Willis) discovers something before something happens to him. Lionel will have to trace his steps and discover who he has been talking too and the corruption that is going on with the Mayor of the city.The plot is dull and with an over long script. It is hard to focus and care on what is going on. The direction is boring. Edward Norton was great playing the character. Bruce Willis was decent for his small brief role. Gugu Mbatha-Raw was okay playing Laura, Lionel's love interest and his source. Willem Dafoe and Alec Baldwin are all side lined as characters.Overall, Motherless Brooklyn is a boring film that fails to get any better with its long and slow direction."
"2319","Motherless Brooklyn",4,"Not what I was expecting","I thought I was going to watch a mistery, detective, noir movie, but this ain't it. This was just a political movie full of white guilt. I'm sorry Hollywood, but we are tired of it. Very disappointed with Edward."
"2320","Motherless Brooklyn",5,"Take notes because it's complicated","I saw a pre-screening last night. I felt it was a very complicated movie that if you didn't pay real close attention to you had no idea what was going on. After the movie was over there were groups of people in the hallway all explaining it to each other what was going on in the movie. Some in our group got it but some did not. All in all I would not see It again."
"2321","Motherless Brooklyn",2,"Too long and boring movie","This movie failed to get me interested. I fell asleep halfway and I'm glad I did, It was not worth my time"
"2322","Motherless Brooklyn",8,"Heartfelt drama mystery but has boring political scenes","To start off, the beginning has you captivated right away. The chase and Minna's death. We get introduced to Lionel and at first it seems a bit odd at his behavior but as the movie progresses, you get used to it. Edward Norton portrays Lionel very well and all of the cast is talented. The only thing about that I have to say is in the first conversation with Laura, his acting seems bad but the rest of the movie his acting his incredible. The only parts that seem complex or boring are the political scenes. The whole ending to do with Paul and Moses is very confusing and I got lost along the way. A rewatch would help.Laura and Lionel's relationship seems a bit rushed and I don't think Laura would like Lionel that easy but she finds his tics amusing while he just keeps apologizing. Alec Baldwin's whole trump like character was not necessary. It was just a way for Norton to express his political views in the film.Near the middle there are boring parts but then it picks back up again near the end and the only thing that seems inaccurate is when Lionel doesn't tic for more than a few minutes you think something is up. He said it happens a lot when he gets nervous or excited or something like that.During an intense scene with a bad guy, you don't see him doing that which makes you question the character a bit. The description said Lionel had OCD but honestly, I didn't see too much of that but I'm no psychiatrist.Lionel is a character you can easily like and he's sweet. His presence gives that off. The cinematography is always somewhat dull but that's what to expect from a noir movie.Edward Norton's passion project is worth watching for anyone who an intelligent audience. For any age inquiries, there is quite a lot of vulgar language, and some blood but other than that, the movie should be fine for teens and up."
"2323","Motherless Brooklyn",1,"Worst movie ever","This is the worst movie you will ever see in the nature of movie making"
"2324","Motherless Brooklyn",5,"It's not ""Goodfellas""","Went to see with high hopes. The movie played more like ""Chinatown"", only instead of Jack Nicholson we got Ed Norton with Tourette's Syndrome. The story is somewhat confusing so you had better pay attention. It was clearly a swipe at Robert Moses who built most of the highways and bridges on Long Island (which was originally part of Brooklyn). Story was about mostly Black people being displaced from their homes through Eminent Domain by idealistic to a fault ""Moses"" character. In reality, people who were displaced by government projects were offered equal value for their property and most property taken was used ,for the housing projects you see today. There is one scene in a Harlem Jazz Club where we must listen to not one or two, but three jazz tunes which has nothing to do with moving the story. However if the slow, moody old style detective genre is your thing you will love this."
"2325","Motherless Brooklyn",4,"A very long and tedious experience","It's amazing the difference two films, both two and a half hours long, can feel like in terms of duration. A great 150 minute film can fly by and leave you asking how it is already over, whereas a tedious film of similar length can feel like 5 hours with you checking the time every ten minutes hoping more time than that has passed. 'Motherless Brooklyn' is unfortunately the latter. This was a very long and painful movie to sit through.The biggest problem with this film stemmed from the fact that I simply didn't care. The film sets up a mystery of sorts early on, and the rest of the film is based around solving that mystery and discovering other truths along the way. The problem is that no time is spent making me care enough about the characters to make me give a hoot about whether they get justice or not. It's not like they couldn't fit it into the runtime, right? There is not one single character in this film (and there are a lot of them) that I found likeable and wanted to see more of.The only thing I managed to enjoy about this film was Edward Norton's performance. He plays a man with Tourette's syndrome and does so very convincingly. He's certainly a very different actor to the one we came to know early in his career, however he can still be very watchable when he wants to be.Sadly though that's where the compliments end for this film. Maybe they could've gotten away with this film if they condensed it down and cut an hour off the runtime. There are ample spots where they could've done it. I couldn't count the amount of times I thought to myself ""Does this scene really need to be here?"" In fact through the middle of the film the investigation part of the story is almost entirely put aside while they try to introduce an extremely forced romance into the story. Stay far away from this one I'm sorry to say. It's not flash."
"2326","Motherless Brooklyn",5,"Slow","The story was okay and the acting was alright but for the most part it was predictable and a little long."
"2327","Motherless Brooklyn",4,"Bad Adaptation","I'm terrible at retaining the plots of books I've read. I can remember whether or not I liked them, but two days after finishing a novel I couldn't tell you the first thing about any of the plot details.I enjoyed reading Jonathan Lethem's ""Motherless Brooklyn"" (not as much as ""Fortress of Solitude,"" but that's a different review), and was looking forward to seeing the film based on it. Half way through I thought to myself, ""man, I really don't remember this book well at all,"" because virtually nothing in the movie, beyond the first scene, rang a bell. How gratifying it was, then, to read other people's reactions to this movie and come to find that it bears almost no resemblance to the novel. I knew I was bad at remembering books, but I didn't think I was THAT bad.I don't know why Edward Norton, who also directed this film in addition to starring, wanted to even make a movie of the book if he was going to change it this much. He sets it in an older time period (the book was present day, I believe, or close to present day). And he clearly wants to force the story into being about the marginalization of urban black people, which is relevant right now but isn't what Lethem's book was about. Just craft an original screenplay if that's the story you want to tell.But even if I could overlook the terrible adaptation, the movie in its own right just isn't any good. It's slow and ponderous and confusing and one-note and too long. There's too much fat, like extended scenes of nightclub jazz, that obviously mean something to Norton but don't necessarily mean anything to the people watching his movie. It's an undisciplined film, as if Norton was making it for himself and a close group of like-minded buddies, not for a more general audience.So it's really a no-win situation. People who come to the film because they liked the book will be pissed that it's not a better version of it, and those who know nothing of the book have only a dull, boring movie to watch.Grade: D+"
"2328","Motherless Brooklyn",5,"Disappointing & Disappointing","This show starts off really good with some strong acting, the set is set up excellent and the conclusion is well intriguing.Yet fails ,went to long could of cut 20mins out was boring ,so by the end you really don't care what happens.Its actually quite funny in some parts with dark humour .I was really disappointed"
"2329","Motherless Brooklyn",4,"Hard to Stay Wake <U+0001F634>","What a phenomenal cast! And, what a phenomenal disappointment! It's slow, it's tiring, it's nothing like the trailers suggested. 2 hours of life I'll never get back. I'd rather watch a Roseanne marathon, than 5 more minutes of this snore fest! Keep it moving people, this film is a let down on multiple levels. But, most of all, it's just straight up BORING! BOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO!!!!!"
"2330","Motherless Brooklyn",8,"an engaging crime drama that is worth every minute of your time","Lionel Easton doesn't have many friends. The Tourette's Syndrome he is suffering from, which compels him to say out loud all the nasties that are on his mind, has made sure of that. When his only friend, mentor and the director of a detective agency is brutally murdered, Lionel will leave no stone unturned in finding the culprit, even if it means going head to head with the most powerful men in NYC.Passion project by Edward Norton finally got its release and it's not all bad news. New York of the 1950's is a fascinating place and if Edward Norton did anything right with MOTHERLESS BROOKLYN it's transporting us to the time and the place.Rather designed for streaming services due to its lengthy run, the movie has been a box office failure, but it doesn't mean it's not great. Norton gives his all to the performance, we can just see here what an underrated actor he is.The film's original score by Daniel Pemberton has received a Golden Globes nomination, but it's the other score, the jazzy one with compositions from the likes of Tom York that is taking MELBOURNE by storm (check out the LP at Readings). Constantly balancing on the verge of a high drama and a noir movie this is an overly long, but ultimately satisfying affair, when whodunit is less important than ""why"". It's a tad predictable but rings true, mostly because of the characters being so warm and alive. At the end you feel like you have persevered with a particularly long book and suddenly realise it is a great one. Probably that was the way Norton felt when he finished the original novel the movie is based on.All in all MOTHERLESS BROOKLYN is an engaging crime drama that is worth every minute of your time"
"2331","Motherless Brooklyn",5,"PC nonsense in 50's era, felt like I was watching actors in traning, repetitive.","This movie was hellishly long I won't get into the boring plot but more the acting and 50's era.Bruce Willis looked like he was reading lines as he went along and didn't even try to act the expressions for the dialog (though I can see why he had a short part, got paid , got out.) , the rest of the movie was tedious acting was not believable it most seemed like they were forcing out their play/part.white man in black neighborhood back then would of been a bad idea (esp going into bars and such with black women), his car would of been destroyed (especially after they though he worked for the state), there was no hint of racisim which I thought was strange for that era / time period. no n word , one black guy used the word cracker though.His disability could of been cut completely since it didn't really help him in the case(photographic memory), except he didn't need to carry a notebook.... half the movie he spent talking about it though and the repetitive ""if"" got tiresome after the 500th time. im sure people with real torrets spit out all kinds of random dialog not just rhymes and non foul language.Tons of plot holes, while it was watchable I don't highly suggest it, it is a very long movie to sit though,while its a ok lifetime detective movie, it just felt like a rippoff off of dick tracy movies.5/10"
"2332","Motherless Brooklyn",9,"Truly Excellent...Don't Let The Run Time Stop You.. !!","Fantastic acting,great writing,and a great foot tapping score.
Must see."
"2333","Motherless Brooklyn",5,"When someone isn't seen for what they truly are, that's a very dangerous thing","Well, I'm disappointed.I love Edward Norton and I've been waiting for this movie since I heard about it for the first time (which is what, like 20 years now?) and while it is still well made movie and a good story, I feel that it's lacking something. It's not consistent - some scenes had that true noir feeling, other just felt flat and out of place. Great cast but poorly directed and edited. I had the feeling that Norton had tried too hard and it went in the opposite direction.Norton as an actor gives really good performance (Defoe as well) but as a director... no. He gave it a shot, he was passionate about it but I think this movie would have had much better ratings if somebody more experienced was behind the camera."
"2334","Motherless Brooklyn",4,"Like the Two Jakes to Chinatown","I get it, I know what it's trying to do, but it hits the beats of greater films like Chinatown or Touch of Evil or L.A. Confidential without capturing the atmosphere of corruption and evil those films communicate so clearly. Here, the emphasis is on the plot underlying the mystery - but the mystery is never as central in film noir as what it suggests about the world in which the gumshoe operates. There are murders, thugs, double crosses, and twists and even a rich and powerful Alec Baldwin standing in for the much more terrifying John Houston's Noah Cross in Chinatown. But they feel rote - plot points we've seen before in better stories.The film lacks a sense of urgency and part of that is due to Norton's direction. He's not a great director, the film lacks memorable scenes, and the story feels both crowded and somehow uninvolving at the same time. The performances are fine, I guess, though the main character's Tourette's probably works better on the written page, in the book from which this script is drawn, where it likely served as inventive word play that punctured a typical first person noir narrative (subverting it). I've never read the book, but here it feels incidental - it's not clear how the condition serves the story or the telling of it, except for the main character's photographic memory, which reveals some important plot points. Finally, there's something too literal about departing from the original novel and setting the story in the 1940s. It suggests a naive commitment to genre that movies like Chinatown transcend by playing with noir trappings to say something bigger about the darkness of human nature. Noir is not a time period, but a mood; an orientation."
"2335","Motherless Brooklyn",5,"Not too bad, not that good either","I never thought I will ever say this about an Edward Norton movie - meh. Although flawlesly acted and despite a stellar cast, the movie seems somewhat disjointed, disconnected and flat. Something important is missing and for some reason I can't really pinpoint it. It's an annoying feeling. I liked it and I didn't."
"2336","Motherless Brooklyn",6,"Don't believe the HYPE!!","I love mobster movies. This one was lacking everything except the props from it's era of time. Enjoy falling asleep or going to the bathroom or getting popcorn. It's ok. You won't miss anything. I know it's not a shoot' em up movie. But I'm always into these types of movies and it really disappointed me. Don't believe the hype."
"2337","Motherless Brooklyn",5,"Another nice, low key film","2019 has been a great year for movies. I was surprised by Motherless Brooklyn. It is a very solid crime drama story that wears it's inspirations on its sleeve. The recreation of 1950s New York was impressive on such a small budget. This was clearly a passion project for Ed Norton, something that I'd like to see more out of Hollywood. Motherless Brooklyn isn't flashy, and it doesn't need to be. It's a good time through and through, and doesn't seem like a two and a half hour movie. Very niche indeed, as I was only one of five people in my theater for the viewing. Some may critique it as being a slow burn, of a story that we have heard a thousand times already. While there is some truth to this, I can't say that I didn't like this one. The performances were not pronounced, yet solid altogether. Norton does a great job, though. It's nice to see Willis and Dafoe in good movies. I haven't read the original novel, and most say that some creative liberties were taken in its production and final product. There are some allusions to modern times, with Baldwin imitating a Trump-esque figure. That never really bothered me, he did a nice job as well. If you're into these sort of slow paced, intriguing films, than Motherless Brooklyn is for you. Once again, I'll say that this one was a pleasant surprise. There's a good chance that it'll rack up some awards as well."
"2338","Motherless Brooklyn",1,"This movie is terrible","Why is this movie so long? The directing is just not good. The story telling is uninteresting. It seems like some of the acting is good but the movie is so bland. I really should have just turned it off 30 minutes in, when I first thought to. It just got more painful to watch."
"2339","Motherless Brooklyn",8,"Motherless is a Methodical and Well Crafted Noir Story for Adult Audiences","Edward Norton is wearing many hats (pun intended) in this movie but you have to respect his performance as Lionel. Its jarring at first but its a respectful portrayal and while we all know how talented he is, this is Norton showing another side of what he can do. I wouldn't be surprised if there's some awards attention for his effort in this lead role. My favourite performance in the movie came from Gugu Mbatha-Raw as Laura. She was WONDERFUL in this, there's so much nuance and compassion in her portrayal. She's involving and her chemistry with Norton was impressive. It was a great reminder of how great she can be (it also helped wash the taste of A Wrinkle in Time out of my mouth). I also really liked Alec Baldwin as Moses Randolph, he was a really intimidating villain. They don't paint him as sympathetic but his character is a force of nature and his complete belief in his right to accomplish what he wants to accomplish was believable and unsettling to me. I would also like to credit Willem Dafoe, Michael Kenneth Williams and Bruce Willis for their work in this movie. If there was a performance I didn't like, I would say Bobby Cannavale but that also might be how his character was handled.Norton is known for his acting talent but I think he did a solid job both writing and directing Motherless on top of starring in it. You can tell that this movie wasn't made for a ton of money but the sets look good, the costumes appear accurate and the cinematography is largely on point. Its largely well shot and well edited, the artistic touches are all decent and I think both he and his team did a nice job of building the setting and bringing you into this world.The trailers for Motherless make it look like its more of a thriller, there are those elements but its more of a detective story that leans into drama with the tension of a thriller sprinkled on top. The movie is more of a character piece that's set up around Lionel. He's very sympathetic and I think they did a good job of drawing him in a way that makes you root for him without portraying him as a complete boy scout. He has a good reason to be the way he is and his affliction isn't just something he can ignore or kick like a bad habit. This is brought about with his relationships with Laura and Frank who look past his behaviour and see what's underneath. I was never moved by Lionel but I did feel sorry for him and I was happy to see him find a little happiness (even though it may or may not be fleeting).I can champion the acting and the plotting of Motherless Brooklyn and I'm happy to do so. But it does have drawbacks that are going to throw some people off. The first is that this movie is very deliberately paced. I think they do a good job presenting Lionel's condition and getting you to care about the characters and the drama in the movie. But it is slow and if you're expecting something like Sin City or even the Untouchables, you might be disappointed. You have to be patient, its one of the choices that makes Motherless a very adult movie. I haven't read the book but they changed the time period this movie was set in and I could tell. I love movies that take place in this era but there wasn't really a reason to set it in the 1950s instead of the intended setting. You also feel like there's going to be a huge payoff in the finale that you don't really get. I'm not trying to sell the ending short, I found it to be satisfying but it was a little anticlimactic. You don't get everything wrapped up cleanly and there's no big gunfight and while I respected that decision, it might be disappointing for some.I love going to the movies but living out in the country, I don't get to see everything that comes to the theatre. I had to go out of my way to see Motherless Brooklyn and I was willing to because I really dig noir/detective stories. The fact that this was a period piece on top of that, I was even more excited. Motherless Brooklyn takes a while to get going and while its slowly paced, the plot thickens and after I settled in, I was caught up in it. They develop Lionel impressively, they sell the stakes of the conflict in the plot and the acting is the cherry on top. With the long run time, it definitely won't be for everyone. Although at face value, they have very little in common, Motherless reminded me of The Ides of March (the George Clooney political drama). Both movies are well written, both are very involving with their share of tense moments and turmoil for the protagonists and they both wrap up with the heroes having to settle for surviving as opposed to winning. I would rate them at about the same level (between an 8 and an 8.5/10) and recommend them with the warning to adjust expectations. Motherless is worth catching in the theatre but if you weren't pulled in by the marketing or it doesn't sound like your cup of tea, don't be fooled into thinking this will sneak up on you. It is what it is and you have to decide whether that's what you want for the 2+ hours this movie takes to tell its story."
"2340","Motherless Brooklyn",4,"WAY TOO LONG AND WAY TOO ANNOYING","I normally make it a habit here not to review a movie unless I've done it the courtesy of watching it all the way through.
On this occasion though, that simply wasn't possible for two main reasons:
1 although I like Edward Norton very much as an actor, his character in this movie was just so utterly annoying/infuriating with those stupid Tourette's type vocalizations as to make it impossible for me to endure the movie beyond about 50 minutes. I am not intolerant of people who suffer from mental illness but this was simply overdone and infuriating. Which leads me to my second point
2 like so many movies these days, at 144 minutes, this one is simply way too long. One doesn't mind making that kind of commitment to a movie like say ""Ford v Ferrari"" (or ""Le Mans 66"" if you prefer). That movie was, in my opinion thoroughly gripping for its whole two and a half hours, but ""Motherless Brooklyn"" just couldn't hold my interest when it was after all (admittedly only as far as I watched) really nothing more than a NYC gangster movie, the theme of which has been flogged to death.
My recommendation is not to waste nearly two and a half hours on this one.

"2341","Motherless Brooklyn",3,"Welp! Can't get the time back","Senseless drool. This was a terrible movie. When the supporting actors outshine your lead....smh...it's never a good thing. Now I see why Marvel gave ed Norton the Ax. Self centered & egotistical ......"
"2342","Motherless Brooklyn",5,"State of current affairs","The movie was a mixed bag. On the one hand, I saw the similarities to the current state of affairs of the United States. On the other hand it was too long and slow.... it would have been more exciting about an hour shorter."
"2343","Motherless Brooklyn",7,"Worth your time","This slow moving 1950's gumshoe detective period piece will occasionally have you wondering if you should stick with it. But you should.
The performances are excellent, the story is engaging, though it occasionally drifts off into some barely relevant territory. It's a good piece of cinema in the end, I didn't regret giving it my evening."
"2344","Motherless Brooklyn",8,"Very enjoyable - Time flew by","I just saw this late at night, not expecting much however, once it began the 2 hours flew by and i was constantly engaged in everything that happened. The story grips one from the get go and you are constantly wanting to know about the next sequence of the story and as the viewer you also play a detective at some points as the movie sets up indirect things the viewer is supposed to figure out. Then i saw the score on IMDB and i was fairly surprised this movie is at a minimum a 7.5. Very good mystery a genre that i do not remember seeing for a while."
"2345","Motherless Brooklyn",6,"They tried so hard, But...","This movie isn't bad and i can easily say that. But something is missing and you can lose your way easily through it. The music is amazing and the direction and you can't forget Norton's acting. I hope you find it entertaining more than me."
"2346","Avengers: Endgame",10,"The End of an Era!","After Avengers Infinity War, we waited for the Avengers Endgame. We wondered how the story would go on, how our heroes would turn back, what would be the end of Thanos. Many theories related to this have been put forward. Avengers Endgame was undoubtedly the most anticipated film of recent years. Normally, the higher the expectation, the higher the probability of disappointment. But this is not the case for Endgame. Whatever you're expecting, you find much more in the film. This means that the biggest concern about the film has disappeared.On the other hand, another comparison comes up. Is Endgame more successful than Infinity War? We can comfortably say it Avengers Infinity War is just the beginning of the story. Endgame was the finale of the story. So we shouldn't think of these two films as two separate stories. There is only one story divided into two parts.Avengers Endgame is, above all, a great homage to the ten-year history of the Marvel Cinematic Universe. The story highlights the original Avengers team. Iron Man, Captain America, Thor, Hulk, Black Widow and Hawkeye are at the center of events. No character comes in front of them. Of course there are many characters that play an important role in the story outside the original Avengers team. Everyone's concern was that Captain Marvel, who was included in the Marvel world, overshadowed other heroes. We can say that this certainly did not happen. What is important in this struggle is not how strong you are, but how good you are. This comes to the fore in all areas. It gives good message about being a hero and a family.Of course, Avengers Endgame has some critical aspects. For example, is the three-hour period necessary in terms of the story? It can be discussed. The head of the story moves much slower than the rest. It also drags the heroes into an emotional predicament. Then the tempo is rising and the heavy scenes we are watching are getting more meaningful. The last 45 minutes of the movie is fully action packed. But the last 45 minutes goes so fast that you don't even realize it. Action and battle scenes are really successful. There is not even a slight distress about visual effects. There are also slight logic errors in the film, but in general the story is so successful that these details become meaningless and insignificant after a certain point.Lastly, Avengers Endgame doesn't have a movie end scene. Because after the film's final, there is no need for another scene. The Marvel legend Stan Lee appears with a small stage. But this is the last surprise scene in the Marvel Cinematic Universe. Moreover, there is no clue about Marvel's future. This makes us wonder more about Spider-Man: Far from Home. 10/10"
"2347","Avengers: Endgame",10,"The ending made all 22 movies worth it","If you're going to watch this movie, avoid any spoilers, even spoiler free reviews.
Which is why I'm not going to say anything about the movie. Not even my opinion. All I'm going to say is:The crowd applauded 3 times during the movie, and stood up to clap their hands after. This I have never witnessed in a Dutch cinema. Dutch crowds aren't usually passionate about this. I checked the row where I was sitting, and people were crying. After the movie, I was seeing people with smudged mascara. That's all I have to say about the movie."
"2348","Avengers: Endgame",10,"Wow!","A wonderful and amazing movie for all the fans.
So much emotions, so many nostalgic moments, and action, humor, drama! We get to see all the superheroes and some more loveable characters.
I feel sorry for those who try to find scientific logic in a movie about superheros. You really need to focus on what's important.
Just enjoy!"
"2349","Avengers: Endgame",10,"An Honest Review","Walking in, given Marvel's latest publicity, I was expecting, well, I was expecting an absolute cringe fest, and thankfully I didn't get it. In fact, there were only a couple of absolute cringe moments and each dealt with Brie Larson, particularly her appearance in the final fight.Thankfully though, Marvel showed a lot of restraint with that and as a result the movie really belonged to the characters that we all have invested over a decade of love and loyalty in....and honestly that was a relief. There were times where the film looked like it wanted to go the other way, and put the OG Avengers in the backseat. So, credit for not doing that.It feels a lot more like Kill Bill 2 in atmosphere than a real Super-Hero movie, all the really fun big fights were reserved for the first film and what's left is a long closing act that is more concerned with tying up loose ends than delivering on over-the-top action. And it works for a send off film after a decade of investment.So what you have feels very much like an intimate and sentimental film made by old friends at send off...or a funeral...but in either case it is absolutely appropriate.Unfortunately, you have the enormously epic CGI battle at the end and I, for one, am kind of done with that trope. It's starting to bore me now, and, honestly, I would prefer something a little more authentic. But, that being said, the film at least called for it.We've seen battles like that before, Black Panther, Aquaman, Infinity War, Lord of the Rings, and, honestly those CGI armies lack any real intimacy. So the end is kind of a bore compared to the rest of the film.The highlight in the film would be Thor with Hulk coming in as a close second. They steal the show from the moment they are introduced and the trademark MCU humor that Black Panther and Captain Marvel utterly lacked. And the humor was a source of comfort after two films that made vague threats of taking themselves far too seriously for a superhero flick.The wrap-up was more than satisfying if not heart-wrenching at moments making it a great send off for a decade of time and money invested in the characters, however the legacy that the MCU is passing on seems in trouble nonetheless and we can only hope that it doesn't go the route that the MCU has been teasing and toying with and continues to deliver fun superhero movies and not the heavy-handed or deadly serious films they have threatened the audience with."
"2350","Avengers: Endgame",10,"All Great Things...","Man! I thought Infinity War was off the hook, but this one...
A perfect compliment to a two part epic. It was what I thought it was going to be, a lot of talk, a lot of planning, but amazingly it was not boring. Not for one second!
Infinity War was the moment we were all waiting for and then they tell us they are going to split it into two films. End Game could have gone south with this choice, but it did not. It's always exciting, especally if you are a comic book fan or have been watching these movies for now eleven years.
Don't want to say too much, but shine a light on Robert Downey Jr. who got to perfect his Iron Man persona to the point where Hugh Jackman can't even surpass him. Captain American is giving all us FanBoys everything we ever wanted to see and Thor...underperforms with hilarious results (and hopefully will create 2019's most popular costume for a certain type of man). Loved Mark Rufflo in this film and Thanos baby, still the baddest villain around.
It's fun it's dramatic, it's like Lord of the Rings with one less movie. Three hours well worth the ticket.
Stan Lee would be proud! Nuff said!"
"2351","Avengers: Endgame",1,"Good movie and CGI","Nonetheless, america has loss..... No Animation or CGI can safe america. Hail Stanley"
"2352","Avengers: Endgame",8,"Great ""ending"" to a saga","Endgame is a great popcorn action movie to ""finish"" a saga of popcorn action movies. This isn't serious entertainment and shouldn't be considered as such, and it reminds me of how George Lucas made Star Wars as an homage to the cheap serials like Flash Gordon. Especially as comic-sourced material, this is what the MCU is. Some part of me is actually a bit pained to like it as much as I do, given that it is just playing on base emotions to make money for a massive conglomerate like Disney.BUT... what a great way to end several major storylines that they invested in over the past 11 years. For people who have watched the saga, I feel like this is just the cherry on the top. My only complaint is something that you can't really get away from in superhero stories: the character ""powers"" are totally inconsistent from scene to scene, and movie to movie. This is a trope that there's no getting away from, because if characters like Captain Marvel, Thor, Scarlet Witch, and Hulk were always as powerful as they show flashes of, then the story wouldn't even be a thing. Any one of them could destroy Thanos in the blink of an eye, and have done similar feats in other stories (and even in other scenes within a given story). That they sometimes ""reduce"" their power to a lower level, without an explained mechanism, is pretty laughable, and makes some parts of the story a bit nonsensical. Yes, this constant Ex Machina is needed to maintain the drama and keep the plot going, but it's still something that takes me out of the story.What I really love about this movie, and the saga as a whole, is how good it is at developing the actual characters and their relationships. There are some similarities, but nobody is the same, and most of the arcs are believable. Thor's story, and apparent PTSD, is to me the best-done, but all of the majors (and some of the minors) are almost as good. I believed them. And for a popcorn action movie saga based on a comic series, I think that's a pretty high compliment."

"2362","Avengers: Endgame",1,"Bad reboot of Avengers: Infinity War","OMG! What have I just watched? Remake of Avengers: Infinity War?The last installment of Avengers looks like another Infinity War with table turning (this time we won) and introduction of few new elements such as Captain Marvel, Ant-Man and time machine. The rest is pretty much the same: whole lot of super-heroes doing crash-smash-flash-zap-bang super-fictional thing we already seen in earlier Avengers. OK, have to admit CGI is awesome but if you strip that the result is below average movie to watch once and leave in archive (if you mistakenly bought disc).Bottom line, I really don't see End Game as a ""Masterpiece"" just because it filled-up box office emerging on top of all movies. It is not something we have not seen before, no breakthrough, not better than Infinity War. Just good advertising boosted this up on hall of fame scale."

The CGI is way overused, not a single shot without some CG ""enhancements"". The story is, well, near nonexistent once you take out the action sequences. I'd give this a 5/10.

It will be interesting to see if they can ever top this on this kind of scale.I regret not seeing Avengers in the theater. This is the type of movie that needs to be watched on the big screen. I avoided it because I thought it was hype and only for the most diehard fans. However I think moviegoers who aren't really into this genre can appreciate Endgame.It's got a lot of fun action. The action scenes were good the movie has some events which kept it from becoming predictable. There were many stories which kept it exciting. I liked the bond between the hero's. The jokes were funny and it really felt like a family.The visuals looked amazing. From the spaceships to the planets the CGI was flawless. I loved it. It showed that the creators put their heart and soul into making this movie. Avengers Endgame is an absolute treat."

I'm not suggesting you need to love this movie or that you can't find fault, but what this and it's predecessor, Infinity War, achieved; not only in cinema, but storytelling as a whole, is laudable. This is not a stand-alone movie and requires some foreknowledge, but it's an accomplished endgame of a movie arc of over 10 years unlike any other in movie history"

"2397","Avengers: Endgame",1,"Totally overrated!! Terrible film with several plot holes","Terrible movie. I have never been a big fan, of Marvel and even less of MCU, but there were several good movies within that universe.... but this one as the Infinity Gauntlet, destroyed all.... No sense to talk about, the respect of the comic source.... but Stan Lee, Jack Kirby, Steve Ditko, and many others involved on their comic origin of the characters has to be suffering in hell seeing how their creations were terribly undermined....... but just analizing from a cinematographic point of view, this film has a terrible argument, script, direction and very poor characters.... 2 hours of the film were not needed, and all the structure that were builded for this collapsed with this ending. Plot holes and nonsense everywhere.This film represents what social media can do.... in a bad way. Stay away, if you can."

"2399","Avengers: Endgame",1,"Why the hype?","While I respect the fans going ga ga and people discussing the emotions etc, I beg to differ. I saw this movie yesterday after all the rush had died out. There were about 25-30 people in the Audi having seating capacity of approx 250.Pace: The buildup is slow and boring.Emotions: Forced and sometimes looks very artificial. You don't feel a thing. When some people said that they cried, I wonder for what. Action: It comes late and is limited. I expected more (isnt that expected in the avengers movies?)CGI: Was good.Storyline: Very weak. It could have been refined. Many of the characters were inserted and wasted.Length: It was unnecessarily prolonged, esp towards the end. They could have reduced the runtime by 20-30 minutes.Overall: Bad. Barely a one time watch, with lots of patience. The studios have created the hype and made their money. The previous avenger movie was way better. This one was a totally let down, just like the Game of Thrones final season."
"2400","Avengers: Endgame",2,"I Wish this Was the End","Soulless junk. The first act promised a serious take on the nature of revenge but the movie quickly gave up on interesting thematic and became a senseless mess.I didn't care for a single character, the action was a confusing mess and the new characters do not give me much hope in the future of these Marvel films. On the plus side, this may mean diminishing returns on future instalments in this ""cinematic universe"" which would be great news for original films that aren't getting screened theatrically from the many megaplex screens being eaten up by this cynical capitalist trash. But hey... maybe the kids like it?"

Infinity war was way better.I went to see it partly because of the high rating, never trusting imdb ratings again. The studio must have fixed some high ratings to induce ticket sales.Massive waste of time and money."

I had my doubts about the Russo brothers, but now I know.
Stop making movies, please ..."
"2406","Avengers: Endgame",1,"Very disappointing","Overated, boring nonsense! Infinity war set me up for what I thought was going to be the best marvel movie ever but end game felt like it was trying too hard to please everyone! Instead of just being a really good marvel movie.
The plot holes were a big part of the disappointment for me."
"2407","Avengers: Endgame",1,"Good but over-rated","A good movie for 12 years old kids! Super heroic movies don't belong in top 250 unless they're Nolan's dark Knight or philipses Joker. Marvel uses politics to win just like all other over-rated movies we're seeing these days. Cheers to the pure old cinema."
"2408","Avengers: Endgame",1,"Bad","Didn't like this marvel movie and I didn't like the others"
"2409","Avengers: Endgame",2,"Fell at the last hurdle","I watch all films with an open mind and went into this 3 hour long film without any preconceptions.This film really let itself down. The writers completely changed some of the characters, they tried to make it funny and failed at every attempt where it was cringe worthy and boring. The story was dragged out to its limit and went on for way to long.Don't waste your money at the cinema, maybe Google the outcome."
"2410","Avengers: Endgame",2,"A large mess.","This movie was a complete mess, after all the years of build up, I didn't care.
It was like putting an entire smörgåsbord into a very small bowl. All the flavours and textures blended and lost their appeal.
Only two characters stood out, Thor and Antman."
"2411","Avengers: Endgame",2,"Better than Game of Thrones Season 8","What a boring, predictable excuse for a movie. I'm so glad I resisted the hype and didn't suffer through this in the theaters. It's obvious this movies reviews are artificially inflated on this site, just look at all the other negative reviews."
"2412","Avengers: Endgame",1,"A mess of a movie","Waste of money and time full of depressive heroes who cry like little babies for 5 full years. The prior is 100 times better than this crap with mediocre lines, but I guess that this is what the masses ask for..."
"2413","Avengers: Endgame",1,"Where's the action in a superhero movie?","Just couldn't not finish it. Felt like a Kardashian Endgame. glad i didn't pay, it any money. What has happened to marvel movies in general are those positive reviews bots or bought? There were less than 1/3 action. The rest were full drama, for a almost 3 hour movie doesn't seem realistic."

"2415","Avengers: Endgame",1,"non-sense","Cheap dialogs, non sense violence. The only thing the movie has to offer is explosions. Is it really that hard to make quality superhero movies? Look at Christopher Nolan's series of Batman movies, those are quality films. This movie is flat, it can be consumed as fast food, nothing to offer really"
"2416","Avengers: Endgame",1,"Pure torture","I had to take several breaks, walk the dogs, play videogames and clean the house, while watching this absolutely ridiculous and nonsensical pile of rubbish and now afterwards, I'm asking myself why I put myself through such suffering. To what end. I guess I was hoping there would be one scene or at least one line that put a smile on my face or made me feel anything at all except extreme pain and boredom. There wasn't any of that unfortunately, so I just wasted three hours of my life I could have spent on basically anything else and it would have been more worth while. I can't decide which one was more painful to watch, this or Aquaman? Both equally and utterly disappointing I guess."
"2417","Avengers: Endgame",NA,"Just so disappointed!","I expected so much from this film but just feel so disappointed by it. A poor and incoherent story with so many contradictions within it plus a total waste of my favourite character - amongst others (like Thanos himself). I did go and rewatch it in the cinema a second time and realised that, without all the excitement and expectation I went in with the first time I was just really really bored.It did have some nice ""moments"", especially the anticipated big fight towards the end. Some characters get a good inning - love Antman and, of course, Iron Man but this is my least favourite MCU film.And the ending...........sigh!"
"2418","Avengers: Endgame",1,"So bad - so cliched - should have known","Seriously I am actually convinced now that nobody in the industry knows how to write an ending. they are so focused on leaving plot opening for a possible future opportunity that they cant give a satisfying ending!
Game of thrones and the decline of Stranger things to mention a few."
"2419","Avengers: Endgame",1,"Per For Pre Pubescent Kids","I'm going to make a leap here, just to leep things simple. The cumulative effect of so called ""super heroes"" is to the true film fan what the white man was to Native Americans: End of life as they knew it. There are 25 actors in this, and it's really sad to see them become prostitutes, like their studios. Why do you think great actors and directors wouldn't be caught dead in these cartoon films? Because they are the antithesis to great film making. Its really sad. I understand my 13 year old daughter seeing something like this. I don't understand older, more mature people acting like these are real films becauseT they arent. They are like the cartoons you woukd watch, before the main attraction started. They all have been dumbed down for the masses to the same exact plot: Good versus Evil; always. I wouldn't, no couldn't; sit through 15 minute of this pablum, not even if you paid me a year's salary to watch. It""s woeful trash, and is ruining the film industry. Stanley Kubrick the master of all the great directors, is rolling over in his grave. You won't see the top directors making any of this trash. People like Abel Ferrara, Marty Scorcese, Ridley Scott, William Friedkin, Spike Lee, or Denis Villeneuve go near a movie such as this. Its all publicity! All you hear about is how much money is made in the opening weeks, but nothing about what the films are like. It makes me sick. I would rather have my teeth drilled without novacaine than watch this. The same goes for the best actors. No way you will see ever see people like Bobby DeNiro, Christopher Walken, Matt Damon, Colin Farrell, Ethan Hawke, Nicole Kidman, or Al Pacino in any of these movies. I understand completely. It's simple. They have integrity! Skip this woeful hyped up trash and go see a real film; not a cartoon."
"2420","Avengers: Endgame",1,"i know i already wrote one but","Did i watch the same movie as everyone else? why are so many people leaving such high ratings for this movie? i guess it being the end of it factors in, but it just wasn't a good film. some good parts, but they take up like 3% of the film."
"2421","Avengers: Endgame",1,"Colossal waste of time","Horrible movie. Boring and poorly written. I don't understand the high rating or the hype. I didn't even finish watching it because it was so awful. I love all of the Marvel movies, but this one was unwatchable. What a waste of a perfectly good Saturday night."
"2422","Avengers: Endgame",1,"Badgame","Worst of the Worst !!!
After IW(which is amazing) this was a disaster. BAd bad movie !!!!"
"2423","Avengers: Endgame",2,"Incredibly dull finale of an amazing franchise","The great thing about the Avengers-Franchise has always been this winning scheme:1. A range of very different characters like Thor, Spidey and Strange, clashing together in witty and funny dialogues that showcases just how different they are. Spidey cracking jokes about deep philosophic insights of Strange, while Thor asks about beer.2. Incredible fight scenes3. Both may be linked by a variety of different narrative elements, from film-noir/detective over comedy to splatter.It's an easy base recipe, that may be filled with any narrative strings, so long as they are intriguing.Problem with the Avengers movies and the finale in particular is:The winning scheme is NOT used and the narrative underlying is poor, at best.They picked parts of a variety of comics (like the ""Thor get's irresponsible and fat""-plot), which is ok and linked them very poorly together. It's a series of short plots, loosely tied together with no red line (other than ""Thanos is the Endboss"").Secondly, the acting is poor, apart from Iron Man of course! Even Chris Hemsworth and Scarlett Johanssen do a really bad job at depicting their character. The digitally animated raccoon is a highlight in terms of acting.There is only ONE AVENGER-TYPICAL FIGHTSCENE, which is great, but does not make up for the rest.Foot-Note: As a Non-American, the Glory-Halleluja-Murica focus on Cap is too much. If you're patriotic enough, you'll love it, of course."
"2424","Avengers: Endgame",8,"Ok hear me out","This is getting a 10/10 mostly because how it doesnt flop on its head ending a 22 movie long plot. Is this the best marvel movie? No not even close, is this as good as infinity war? No, me 2 months ago would say it is but me now would say other wise. But simply for the experience of seeing the first iron man in theaters when I was 8 to now me as 19 and making me cry it is easily a 10/10 due to it being like no other experience. If it wasnt an ending to a 22 movie long era than mayhe my score would reflect like an 8 or a 7, but due to it being what it is I am willing to bump it up. It is still better than like 15 marvel movies, it's still up there for one of their stronger movies. It's not as good as infinity war and winter soldier is still my favorite marvel movie not counting spiderman movies.
TLDR: Its simply unlike any experience in film yet, having a movie end a 22 movie long story and not flop on its face, usually movies cant finish a 3 movie long story without flopping, yet this movie managed to do it with a 22 movie long story. It isnt the best marvel movie, far from it, I would argue that infinity war is a much better movie, but I would say that this is my 2nd favorite avengers movie"
"2425","Avengers: Endgame",1,"Boring","Boring rehashed rubbish. Too long! Too many characters again!! Seen it all before and now I am bored of Marvel and DISNEY!!!!"
"2426","Avengers: Endgame",9,"A Masterpiece","Wow there are so many troll reviews by inarticulate rubes who can't even explain their opinions.People are entitled to their own tastes, and the super hero genre of the Marvel variety that is a pastiche of action/adventure, sci-fi, and fantasy doesn't appeal to everyone, but for what it is, for what it succeeds at being for its target audience, Avengers: Endgame is currently the benchmark as a satisfying grand finale in a cinematic universe.There can be no doubt that Infinity War and Endgame are masterpieces. That doesn't mean they're the best movies ever made, or that they're better than other masterpieces of different genres, it just means that it succeeds in every element required of it.The barrier of entry to The Avengers, especially the last two films, is quite high and requires someone to watch a lot of movies, and without an investment in those characters in the Marvel film that lead up to Infinity War and Endgame, a casual viewer will not care the same way a fan will. Yet that shouldn't detract from how skillfully the writers and directors manage to balance so many elements and fuse so many genres to deliver a unique piece of pop-entertainment that is full of humor, spectacle, and drama.The Avengers is not a particularly profound franchise. It doesn't attempt to be allegorical like The Lord of The Rings, it isn't as mind-expanding as The Matrix, it isn't as mystical as the original Star Wars, nor does it make any social commentary like The Dark Knight, but it has plenty of great archetypal characters who embody different aspects and struggles with heroism. Each character plays so well off the other and the cast has so much chemistry.No other franchise understands its characters better than Marvel, and no writers have a better grasp of heroic conflict and camaraderie than Christopher Markus and Stephen McFeely. Comparing their work in Endgame to other franchises like the DCU's Justice League or the current Star Wars is night and day.That isn't to say Endgame is perfect. A Masterpiece doesn't have to be perfect, and most aren't. Certain elements of the plot feel rushed and loopholes are glossed over. Not all the jokes land, but most are pretty funny. Captain Marvel is way too powerful which constantly makes her a Deus Ex Machina. There are any combination of nitpicky observations I could make about parts that don't exactly make sense, but those are minor.Admittedly, I do have a bit of Marvel fatigue after this. It almost feels like Endgame was so epic that I don't ever need to see another super hero movie again. Sure, I'll probably see the new Spider-Man, and even though I really like the films and the character, it's reaching a point of over-saturation."

"2433","Avengers: Endgame",1,"Absolute waste of time","What a waste of time. I am so sorry for all the Thor & Hulk fans. I really am. Movie makers played everyone for fools with all the hype. Lord of the Rings and Avatar remains my all time favorite. My advice to all those who havent watched the movie yet, please do yourself a favor and wait for the DVD. It is highly likely that you will feel wasted like me, so at least you will have saved the money."

"2435","Avengers: Endgame",2,"A complete hype","I have watched the movie when it was just released. A couple of months later and I was looking at the reviews. I cannot believe all the 10/10 scores for this movie.Personally I was extremely disappointed with this final movie. Infinity war was an amazing good movie, end game delivers a very simple story based on the time machine concept with plenty of flaws. While I understand the hype and the popularity of the MCU the movie was not bringing me what I was hoping for. There is no further clarification of what led to this movie. The new hulk is another example what I believe was too far fetched. But I don't think I should continue. Surely it is a must see, but for me remains Endgame one of the less convincing movie of this long series of movies brought to us in the las ten years."
"2436","Avengers: Endgame",1,"Seriously?!","Man what a let down after Infinity War. Virtually no action in a superhero movie. Predictable plot with lame time warping around all over the place.

"2437","Avengers: Endgame",2,"Way Overhyped","It's hard to believe that this is the highest grossing movie of all time. It's not even that good of a Marvel movie.I understand that this is based on a comic book characters but damn! The fact that this movie is so successful is pretty much the reason why Hollywood thinks they can get away making movies that aren't all that well thought out but look cool. The first hour was downright painful to get through and if they had taken out a lot of the unnecessary crap, this movie easily could have been 2 hours long."

"2441","Avengers: Endgame",2,"Cheap sentimentalism and plot all over the place","This was supposed to be the final movie that crowed the franchise and Infinity War set high expectations. I was utterly disappointed. The plot doesn't make sense and throws away a lot of character development, to the point that some of them are just shallow version of what they were in other movies (and could become).But what really annoyed me was the sentimentalism that permeated the whole movie. It is like you have to shed a tear for every character and the movie is trying to make you cry in scenes that don't move the plot forward. If in Infinity War they really stroke a good balance between action and emotion, here they just are there for the sake of it."
"2442","Avengers: Endgame",1,"The fast and furious of comic book films","This is hopefully the end of this long standing, inconsistent, money spinning series. And it's also the worst of them all.

It's like that never happened), and oh yeh the characters all change...like all the time. Remember when this one was bad and this one was good? Not anymore! And what is with their hair?! At the initial meeting to discuss the film concept did someone just say ""hair. Too benign.

"2446","MILF",7,"Feel good movie","There is no deep storyline here. However, I enjoyed the beach atmosphere, beautiful people, erotic scenes, lovely music and hilarious nature of some scenes. This is a very good movie if you want to chill out a bit without making your mind exhausted."
"2447","MILF",10,"Fall in love again","A French romantic comedy.
It's about some forty-something friends who go to a beach house to sell it and spend time together, but their plans change when some twenty-somethings try to seduce them.
Quality.
Entertaining.
Good physicists and good performances.
Pleasant sexual jokes, as well as sarcasms.
The nudes and the careful sexual scenes and very French.
Can a man be with a younger woman and nobody says anything, but if a woman with someone younger is attacked in prejudice? That explores this movie.
It talks about mature and young love, of loving yourself at any age, highlights the value of women, of relationships that give security, that there is no age to love and value yourself.
In fact this topic is not new: Naomi Watts handles it very well in the drama ""Adore"", as well as Catherine Zeta-Jones in ""My second time"" falling in love with men younger than them."
"2448","MILF",10,"It's a wonderful real complicated funny movie! How on","Earth did all the reviews here missed that?! I bet the bad reviews belong to feminists reviewers how didn't even bothered watching this sweet honest funny movie... I'm a woman btw."
"2449","MILF",10,"Enjoyable","It is a movie that you feel like you are on a holiday near a villa. This movie is so enjoyable that you can watch to have fun while you are drinking your glass of wine or beer etc."
"2450","MILF",8,"Valid Points Played Out","It's a hot & humid summer here in Chicago which is typically the ripest romantic season but as we're still in the middle of this pandemic it hasn't felt quite as it should so I personally appreciated the softcore steamy escape to the south of France. I found empowering women themes played out, challenges to double standards, & some funny jabs at adult websites leading to underwhelming ""sleepy time"". HAH. I'd say a fun flick for a girls (or guys) night or solo wine & Netflix sesh. I'm a 30yo female. I noticed all the acclaimed critics almost all male... lame! They didn't get it?!"
"2451","MILF",2,"Not a good film, and not a comedy","This is one of those movies where each scene by itself is fine, as are the actors and the scenery, but all those scenes put together make for a senseless boring misogynistic story that is not even tied together at the end. And, it's not funny, there was exactly one moment in the film where I laughed (and, mostly because I was waiting to laugh for an hour by that point), all the rest of it was tedious drama and awkward moments that one keeps hoping would end up making some sense at the end, but they never do. What a loss of time. Another problem with this film is the way it portrays women of (all ages) as weak, clingy, hung up on men, ready to sleep with anyone willing and then getting obsessed with them. The only way a woman, according to this film, can leave a man is when another man takes her away from him. Men take women or leave them, women have no agency and no core. Even the female friendship, which is supposed to be central to the story, is shown as being shallow and fickle - it's not a friendship, it's a tolerance or usage, when it's convenient. I am disappointed with this movie, especially because it employs a good acting crew, and I feel sorry for the women who played in it. For the men too, in fact. Save yourself some time and skip this sorry attempt at humor. Go watch Pretty Ugly People on youtube, if you want an engaging relationships comedy."
"2452","MILF",6,"6/10","It's kind of sweet and moving. I liked it a lot! Romantic, summer movie. Zero problems. Sexy boys. Sexy girls."
"2453","MILF",10,"Nice execution of the theme","The movie has an interesting premise and it is executed equally well. They have explored 3 different kind of dynamics between 3 couples of older women and young men. I don't understand the hate the movie is getting because the characters are well written and are consistent throughout the movie and they evolve perfectly with the story. None of the romances are sugarcoated and all of them have their bitter sweet moments. Was a really great watch! Hope to see more from the creators of the movie."
"2454","MILF",8,"not a stereotypical movie","Good to see women of this age group represented, the movie is heartwarming, and it could reflect how single women at this age feel and the challenges they face."
"2455","MILF",2,"Bad","Where to start? In the first 5 minutes you can see you're in for a very weak movie! The directing, the plot and the worst, the acting! The acting is so bad in this movie you ask yourself how are those people actors! It's hard to go throw all the film, it's a very cringy one!"
"2456","MILF",9,"I am rating this movie 8","Its up to you if you like romance then you will feel good and this movie is good if u like romance"
"2457","MILF",2,"Just Awful","Man, I don't know where to begin. Absolutely inane plot that drags along at a snail's pace. Sex scenes that start like a bad porno but then just end before it gets interesting. Save yourself the time and just watch porn if that's why you're interested in this flick; pornos have a better-developed plot."
"2458","MILF",2,"no","The most uncomfortable hour and a half currently on netflix"
"2459","MILF",6,"Ok movie nothing new could have been funnier","It could have been funnier and it should have been funnier the actress are ok in the show. But the direction and whoever is handling camera needs to go back to school poor shooting"
"2460","MILF",8,"Not great, but conveys the message pretty clear and strongly","The movie does not open in a promising way, however in hindsight it ends up making pretty much sense. Sex scenes are not sexy, with not forced nudity. Some dialogues might be a little misogynistic but then they try to put a kind of male into perspective. Overall a decent one time watch."
"2461","Target Number One",7,"Well researched, surprisingly accurate for a relatively low budget Canadian movie.","Well worth a watch! A credible account that was well depicted.I can't speak for 80's Canada but it got 80's Thailand spot on. DEA and British customs were very active in Thailand at that time. They pressured the Thai police which,in turn, vigorously targeted foreigners, escalating the severity of relatively minor drug offences, and if they didn't have the funds to buy their way out of trouble, in they went. To divert attention from the real ( protected) players, to satisfy visable Thai compliance, to deter chancers and newcomers but predominantly to bolster publicity for Reagan and Bush's, well funded and highly lucrative ""just say no! "" ""war on drugs.""There from 84 to 92. The film brought back a lot of memories, not least those shackles that Justin Jackson mentions in his review. I'd forgotten the peeling blue/green paint that was everywhere. The prison population seemed authentic apart from a lack locked up foreigners (among other nationalities lots of Nigerian mules were convicted around that time) the film depicts the situation and era very well."
"2462","Target Number One",6,"Amazing true story - not so great movie","I remember reading the actual news from this incident back when I was in my late teens, early twenties. Victor Malarek did an incredibly good job at showing how incompetent Canadian officials who couldn't cause a significant dent in the drug trade coming from Asia into north america decided to use a straw man to create a fictitious incident in order to improve their image.
The incident in itself and how it was covered back then by journalist Malarek was plain riveting. Unfortunately, the movie that was made about it is clearly not a top quality product and misuses the talent of great actors. Still worth watching just to learn about what happened."
"2463","Target Number One",8,"Underrated film!","May not have the grip of a massive Hollywood thriller but it isn't far off. Engaging and well worth a watch. A solid 8 out 10."
"2464","Target Number One",7,"An engaging and frustrating film.","""Target Number One"" is a well directed, well acted and compelling Canadian film that everyone should see.
.
In this drama based on a true story, a Canadian journalist investigates the circumstances surrounding the suspicious arrest of a heroin addict imprisoned in a Thai jail.
.
Well crafted and unafraid of telling the true story; ""Target Number One"" dives deep into a frustratingly un-Canadian crime story and really delivers. This is the first Canadian film to be released since Covid-19 hit and it truly is a really good film to kick it off. Josh Hartnett gives probably the performance of his career and Antoine Olivier Pilon is exceptional. The film is never boring nor does it lag, it's the perfect length and pace and I really enjoyed it.
."
"2465","Target Number One",2,"Extremely disappointing","This film was completely overcooked and half baked at the same time. While the lead actor who played Daniel Legey was solid and Jim gaffigan's character was enjoyable on screen, the rest of the supporting cast were a drain... Especially all of the police officer roles. Halfway through the film, we knew it was a dud but somehow felt committed - yet we were simply watching actors play out their roles instead of being immersed in the story itself... Hoping it would miraculously turn around in the third act: spoiler alert, it doesn't. There's absolutely no reason this story required 135 minutes to tell and certainly does not deserve two plus hours of anyone's time."
"2466","Target Number One",10,"Having been there this is 95% right - never seen any film more spot on","Worth a watch - got the Bombad stuff 100% right - almost wish i hadnt watched it - the clothes the conditions - the chains we wore and that constant tinkle in the back ground of chains As for the story - met so many guys in Bombad and Klong prem that got set up that way - I actually worked with a guy in the E thing that we found out later was also feeding the DEA set up busts - Bradley was his name - someone gave him a hotshot in a patpong cafe - guessing he got susseed out - but yes this kind of BS was still going on Mid 90s and am guessing it still is"
"2467","Target Number One",3,"Don't recommend","During the film the camera was shaking. Music was very loud. Acting is poor even though the plot is interesting except Josh Hartnett. Very disappointing!"
"2468","Target Number One",NA,"Absolute Garbled Junk & MANY False Good Reviews","Amazing that all the positive reviews were msde either1 day before release or a day after. Within 8 mins I gave up as the music was so loud it completely blocked out what the actos were saying.
Movies usually never work out well when the writer also directs them. This was the case for this one"
"2469","Target Number One",5,"confusing, and hard to know what to believe","Its supposedly made over a true story , where names and plot are changed to such a degree that it feels like fiction. the story goes back and forth between canada and thailand, where everybody, even the copper seems to be snorting their own deals undercover. the little but noteworthy important timeline info that are usually used to tell the viewer where and when things happen are totally missed out. that is a cathastropic failiure even in quasi biographical movies.the journalist thing was the only part of the show i could hardly find the true purpose of, for the rest its just a tuktuk thai french froglike canadian english heroin blur, made on a undynamic and low budget. the actors does not impress much on a plot and story directed in a way i cant comply withthe grumpy old man gives no more than a max of 5 for this show, have seen a few worse and a whole lot of far better flicks than this. just a weak recommend"
"2470","Target Number One",8,"Insjustice beem served.","Very good and entertaining movie! (sure, it could be 20 or 30 minutes shorter) but it don't take away the outstanding acting delivered by Josh Hartnett and the rest of the cast, to be fear.
Great production. Nothing fancy, but put you in the 80's mood within no problem!
It deserve the 8 I gave or more!!"
"2471","Target Number One",3,"Had to stop watching!","The music is too loud and I got motion sickness with the shacking of the camera"
"2472","Target Number One",4,"Dreadful","Do not watch this movie. I'd say this review contains spoilers, but considering I still don't know what the movie was about after watching it, I'll say there are no spoilers.
I rarely review bad movies because its just too easy to rag on them sometimes. This is some low hanging fruit to criticize. An hour into the movie, my wife looked to me and asked me what this movie was about and I couldn't answer her. I finished the movie and I still can't answer the question.
Josh Hartnett (Hollywood just won't give up on this guy for some reason) doesn't seem interested in this role. He's swollen (from booze?) and even though this movie takes place in Montreal at times (where I'm from) it just wasn't enough to recommend."
"2473","Target Number One",9,"Really great story!","So pleased to see a well written, well filmed, well acted story, and set in Canada no less. The thing with Canada is that it has such a clean image on the world stage, you'd never think they'd throw their own under the bus. So, in that sense too, the story was original. It was edited very well, and kept the story line interesting. Such a pleasure to see the talented Hartnett do his thing too. Very good actor for this film based on a true story. Refreshingly great."
"2474","Target Number One",8,"unconvincing at first? i know","First of all, Great performance !! Josh Harnett was delivered a really good performance. So do the rest of the actor.i loved the story, its gonna pump you chess up. i'm going to say that not everybody gonna like this story, but for me its pretty good. They way they executed all of it was brilliant. you can tell that this not that movie with a 'budget'. But the fact that they still doing a good job was a PLUS.Great detail for me for making that 80' vibes"
"2475","Target Number One",3,"annoying","Storywise wasnt bad -3 star for damn back and forth between languages. cant u ppl stick 2 one fk lng?"
"2476","Target Number One",3,"Very poor quality camera work","This movie is not worth the $6.99 I paid. The camera work is unsteady throughout making it very distracting to watch. They hired an amatuer to do the cinematography."
"2477","Target Number One",8,"great to see Josh Hartnett back - well made Canadian film","Great to see Josh Hartnett back - well made Canadian film, fine acting and good base on true events story"
"2478","Target Number One",7,"Authentic Thai","Very real Thai scenes depicting 1980's Bangkok, some like the Station Hotel have not changed. But when it says prisoners are singing in Thai they are praying in Pali and I have yet to come across zen Buddhism in Thailand, it's theravada."
"2479","Target Number One",6,"Most Wanted/Target Number One (2020) tt1656177","Good story, lil' under mediocre x-cution(It also waaaay 2 american then it should be, especially Ukrainian reporter who got what he wanted 2 b, it's also '89 - this should be more raw then it is but whatever, i'm already surprised that some censorship was given some slack)Always-on-Canadian-police-side twitter nerds r triggered now XD"
"2480","Target Number One",8,"Worth watching","A friend told me he heard Victor talking about the movie on CBC. He told me about it and it sounded like it was an interesting topic so I gave it a chance. I enjoyed it. Maybe it hits home more because I am a Canadian but I feel like it is worth a watch!"
"2481","The Silencing",6,"Prevented from being very good. Watch Wind River (2017) instead","Everything about this movie is ""okay"". The story, the characters, etc. are all okay. None of it is bad. But none of it is fantastic either. It does the bare minimum a good movie should do. Good acting. Good writing. Good pacing. Good filming. Good editing. From a technical, movie 101 perspective, everything is textbook and it doesn't make any huge mistakes.However, where the movie prevents itself from being very good, is in the following two things:1. Ruins one very good opportunity and turns it into a pointless plot device. Midway through, a discovery is made which raises the stakes tremendously. From that point, the film could have done something very good. But in the end it's rendered useless as the plot jumps onto something else. And the villain emerges with very unconvincing motive.2. It's a carbon-copy of a much better movie called Wind River (2017). I couldn't help but notice the similar look/feel within the first few minutes. The setting, the music and how the story opens was very similar. And much to my disappointment, the borrowing of ideas didn't stop there. The rest of the movie is practically the same. So if I could recommend one thing, is to go and watch the that other movie (Wind River) instead. Wind River is everything that this movie wishes it could be. In every department, that movie is fantastic."
"2482","The Silencing",6,"The Solid Nikolaj and the Half Realized Script","It's always interesting to see what the stars of big and beloved shows do after their characters leave (or when the show ends, sometimes in a manner that's anything but beloved... Yes, Benioff and Weiss), so a thriller with Nikolaj Coster-Waldau (Game of Thrones) and Annabelle Wallis (Peaky Blinders) was anticipated with intrigue. The setting and plot topped the cake off with a cherry. And so, ""The Silencing"" is quite the decent thriller - never reached the stars and pales considerably in front of its spiritual similars and perhaps inspirations (True Detective, Wind River etc.), but no aspect really in this movie is below the average.Nikolaj portrays Rayburn Swanson, a reformed hunter living in solitude in a wildlife sanctuary, troubled deeply by the disappearance of his daughter years ago. A deadly game of cat and mouse ensues, as he and the town Sheriff Alice (Annabelle Wallis) set out to track down a newly active serial killer who may have also kidnapped Rayburn's daughter. The story provides most of what one would expect, chases, clues, violence, investigative and other misconceptions, offering also some minor plot turns that could raise a couple eyebrows. Though serious and working on heavy themes, ""The Silencing"" lacks suspense and the atmosphere that could've been, as plot largely functions on familiar tropes and leads to a rather clichéd final act. Where the first feature screenplay by Micah Ranum doesn't realize its full potential, the performances, geographical backdrop and visual work tries their best to make up for it. I took some issue with the character of Alice, and Annabelle Wallis didn't have a whole lot to shine on, whereas Nikolaj's offering of Rayburn felt like the most fulfilled character, and acting performance within ""The Silencing"". Shot in Ontario, Canada, ""The Silencing"" utilizes the landscapes and small town's drab charms well, though this backdrop eventually plays a role smaller than I'd wish to see. Cinematography's solid if not exactly impressive, though throughout I was thinking it'd do better with a little less greys in color grading.""The Silencing"" feels lesser than it should've been, but it's never bad or truly boring. Decent, but forgettable, lands in the middle, one of those many movies that feel disappointing for... not being disappointing. Fans of rural thrillers, devious small town shenanigans and serial killer mysteries should be able to find a kick or two in ""The Silencing"". My rating: 6/10."
"2483","The Silencing",4,"A confusing absurd mess","The reviews here are being far too kind. Whilst it has an interesting premise the film just bungles along and has far too many plot holes and characters making absurd choices.The writing is pretty bad and annabelle Wallis' performance is seriously phoned in and at times - just bad. The reveal of the killer is a serious let down and the motive is just not believable at all.The scenery is nice but the cinematography is very uninspired and very low budget looking. Give this one a miss."
"2484","The Silencing",6,"Decent movie","Solid 6 star film. Not great not terrible. Dragged a little here and there but was still watchable."
"2485","The Silencing",7,"An effectively straight forward revenge thriller, that plays out like a northern wilderness feature film version of True Detective.","You can definitely tell the writer and the director were heavily influenced from the True detective series for this particular film which is a good thing imo. The visual style, thematics, and plotting aspects are executed in similar fashion as the show. The overall story is relatively run of the mill as far as the murder mystery, and seeking revenge in tracking down the killer. Still it stays interesting enough and never gets too stale with enough intensity and suspense to keep attention. The actors are all decent and keep a level of intrigue throughout. Also some very well done cinematography and fantastic scenery/settings. There are some moments that seem a tad cliché like a big reveal towards the end, but overall it does what it needs to as a basic thriller."
"2486","The Silencing",7,"Even Nikolaj couldn't save this one","Decent directing, excellent cinematography, but the writing needed more ""oomph"" and a more cohesive plot with less plot holes and technical issues. A good watch, but nothing spectacular. Would've been better as a short film, as the 93 min runtime with the slow pacing made this film feel much longer."
"2487","The Silencing",8,"A well acted and twisty thriller movie well worth your time","'The Silencing' had all the things I love in a film. It had unexpected moments sprinkled throughout, a lead character I liked and wanted to be alright in the end, a whodunnit element and some twists. What more could you ask for from a thriller? This was the type of movie that was coming out every week back in the 90s, and they were all great, yet these days you're lucky if you get one every couple of months and they're not usually as good as they used to be. So when I come across one as well done as this film was it is a rare treat.Nikolaj Coster-Waldau from 'Game of Thrones' plays the lead role, and he was a remarkably good lead-man. Not only is he naturally likeable but he is also very easy to sympathise with. His character has had something awful happen to him and so he has become an alcohol and can be quite unpleasant to his ex-wife's husband for example. Sometimes these characters can be very hard to get onboard with if they're played by the wrong actor, but in this case I was happy to look past his flaws and get on-side with him.As mentioned earlier I really like a good whodunnit. They're incredibly out of fashion these days unfortunately, but 'The Silencing' is a great reminder of how well they can work in cinema. I really enjoyed this movie and would highly recommend people give it a watch."
"2488","The Silencing",5,"A Decent little Thriller ....","So yeah the movie is actually pretty engaging and its backed with an amazing backdrop and a solid performance from Nikolaj . However this movie is far from being unforgettable as it is let down by a cliched climax. The last 15-20 mins of the movie makes its feel like its just an another serial killer movie .. The movie lacked originality that at some point it had to resort to the way a serial killer movie would usually go. People who are fond of this genre could enjoy watching this movie without any expectation once .."
"2489","The Silencing",8,"Better than expected","This is definitely worth a watch. I'm a very picky viewer and if a film doesn't grab me in the first 10 minutes then I'll quickly turn it off. I'm happy to report this kept be interested for the full (nearly) 90 minute run time, which is the perfect length for a picture like this IMHO.Jaime Lannister once again did not disappoint. I thoroughly enjoyed Shot Caller so I figured I'd give this a try as well and I'm glad I did. A couple decent plot twists along with good performances from all actors and a decent script held this picture together quite well.Its far from Oscar worthy, but its also slightly above straight DVD, $1 store trash bin. Just a decent little thriller that should hold your attention for 90+ minutes. I recommend it."
"2490","The Silencing",4,"Could Have Been","Interesting setting, with okay cast. Just needed a little improvement in writing."
"2491","The Silencing",4,"Do yourself a favor and watch Wind River instead.","A clone of a better movie really, Wind River is a much more interesting and better paced watch."
"2492","The Silencing",6,"this is a cloaked twinn peaks","Ive seen better movies on this subject/topic, and that is because there are too many inconsistencies and loud screams of ludocrisity done by the caracters in the plot. a superindependent sheriff that does the lonesome ride everywhere danger is, and the parkkeepers lack or will of communicating with police and others in dire situations, a w/t or a cell might have given some truthfulness working or not, or a simple houseline phone or better. its also hard to understand the police juristictions and the way law enforcement are dealt with, it just becomes deadwater where there are no push to be found.acting wise, and the filmographic presentation are well done, much thanks to the choice of locations and nature scenery, but the story are plotted like good old ''twin peaks'', extremely slow, and wait till next weekend to get another clue.its a film that will enerve some and make others bite nails from the nerves, the grumpy old man liked the first one third the rest is for you to decide. its a recommend anyway"
"2493","The Silencing",9,"Exceeded my expectations!","Really good! Lots of tension and twists.
Exactly what I'm looking for in movies now: No more of the same.
A movie that I'll probably gonna watch again!"
"2494","The Silencing",4,"Underwhelming","Slow and lugubrious like a funeral procession with a by the numbers script we have all seen before - Nothing new to see here, quite a tedious & depressing sub par thriller if you can even call it that."
"2495","The Silencing",4,"A solid film.","I gotta admit, this was a solid film. A watchable serial killer film with a couple of nonsensical scenes but overall consistent to the end. I do enjoy that the killer was not revealed unto the very end, and that's a good sign of someone putting in the time of writing a somewhat coherent story. For me it was a one time kept my attention the whole time watch but not to be watched ever again film."
"2496","The Silencing",7,"Very Nice Worth a watch","Everything is nice except it's a tad bit slow at times, lacks much action.... the movie on the whole is nice and definitely worth a watch on a lazy Weekend."
"2497","The Silencing",9,"Kept me hooked till the end.","I am generous with a 9 cos i enjoyed this movie. Simple, aint no wannabe critic. It is rare to find good thrillers n horror films nowadays.
This movie has ample amount of tension n suspense. It started without wasting any time n at the same time it delivered developed characters n background stories.
The twist came as a surprise.
The plot may remind viewers of Nic Cage's Frozen, Renner's Wind River n Most Dangerous Game.
The story is about an alcoholic ex hunter who has become an animal savior n lives secluded in a sanctuary named aft his daughter who has been missing since five years. The arrival of a new sheriff brings some hope in the method of investigation but things get ugly aft a discovery of a female teen's dead body pointing to a killer who is hunting teens for sport."
"2498","The Silencing",10,"Great low budget thriller","A little slow start, but then turns into an edge of your seat thriller."
"2499","The Silencing",5,"Just an average film","You would figure that in this day and age movies would need something more to be approved. A true story, or based on true events, unjust conviction, innocent and found guilty. I mean there are thousands of real stories out there that are interesting, thoughtful and memorable.Why spend money, time and effort and make an average film that probably barely break even, especially in a time where the biggest bang for your buck, the theaters, are shut down?I always hope hollywood will get better at making films but they never seem to do."
"2500","The Silencing",8,"Filmed in my Hometown Sudbury!","Was pretty cool to see all the shots of the Northern Ontarian city that I grew up in. Seems like Scuzzy Sudz is getting famous :)"
"2501","The Silencing",1,"I thought I was watching a USC senior class project.","This movie truly sucked.
Tried to get in to it, but decided to take a nap.
Time better well spent."
"2502","The Silencing",8,"solid movie","I dont write many reviews but felt this one is way better than the reviews, it kept me entertained right through"
"2503","The Silencing",6,"Shut your cock-hole, Patty.","I like the mystery, story-wise, albeit seems like a copy of other films; and the twist too. The cinematography is pretty darn good. Nikolaj Coster-Waldau delivers such good performance among other okay-casts. Overall, this film is good but there is still room for improvement. It's not that wow but it's watchable."
"2504","The Silencing",6,"Just entertainment","Keep your expectations low with this one and you'll be fine. First, the setting, scenarios and cinematography are the best of this movie. Second, the script even pretty predictable and simple, has a few good twists. Last, acting from the main character is the best one.
On the other hand, a lot of plot holes from the script make this movie a little messy and empty.
So, overall just an entertaining movie. Watchable but far from great."
"2505","The Silencing",6,"Simple but interesting...","""The Silencing"" is an Action - Thriller movie in which we watch a father trying to find the man behind the kidnap of his child while he has to deal with his addiction in alcohol. Soon he will realize that his daughter was not the only victim and he has to do his best in order to find that man.I have to admit that I did not have high expectations from this movie but I was happily surprised by it because it was not only a nice and interesting movie but it was more than this. The direction which was made by Robin Pront who is also the writer, it was very good and I believe that he did an excellent job on focusing and presenting his main characters problems, history and goals. This had as a result to make us not only relate to them but also to feel that we are a part of it, something that made his movie far more interesting. Finally, I have to say that the interpretations of both Nikolaj Coster-Waldau who played as Rayburn and Annabelle Wallis who played as Gustafson were very good. I highly recommend everyone to watch this movie because it is a nice thriller with a simple but interesting plot and some very good interpretations."
"2506","The Silencing",10,"Nikolaj Coster Waldau","Story pace is good and thrilling till the end ! Yeah, the main cast is all the reason to watch.. Nikolaj Coster Waldau always delivers his best, get beat up so many times, that's quite an action there.. So it's pretty enjoyable watch, not boring..Although there's some parts that can improve.."
"2507","The Silencing",7,"Decent Crime Thriller","Although the last twenty minutes of the movie is somewhat too predictable, overall this is a decent crime thriller. I would have preferred we be given more background details, especially concerning what happened before the beginning scenes of the movie.But there's a very good cast here, and there's enough mystery and suspense to keep the viewer's interest."
"2508","The Silencing",NA,"Intense and suspenseful","I find it pretty intense, suspenseful and engaging. I think Rayburn is captivating because of his past, and his unique role in the search for the killer. I enjoyed watching it."
"2509","The Silencing",10,"Brilliant Movie","Brilliant movie. Excellent plot and acting.
A must watch"
"2510","The Silencing",5,"Back and forth and around and around","There was so much back-and-forth and around and around that I got impatient. It was too many suspects in the movie. Once the killer was revealed, I had three big questions: really?? huh?? And what?! The person that was the killer didn't make any sense. When you watch this movie you'll know what I mean. What saved this movie was the acting. I would say, watch this movie on a day when there is nothing else available to watch."
"2511","The Silencing",10,"Great Film","Hero Fiennes-Tiffin's acting is amazing! It is very interesting and I would reccomend!"
"2512","The Silencing",2,"Waste of time","Good names bad movie. Nothing worth keeping you watching it.. I t was a disappointment."
"2513","The Silencing",2,"BAD BAD BAD NO VERY VERY BAD","See, there is no need to review this movie with much talk because it is a very bad movie, no beautiful production, no impressive performance, no strong script scenario. Very very bad. Oh, Lord, help me, this movie is only for sale. And anyone will see it good for you."
"2514","The Silencing",7,"Better Than Expected","Not a new concept but nothing is these days, never really expected much from this but i was pleasantly surprised. Goes a long at a decent pace and is well worth a watch."
"2515","The Silencing",1,"Sheriff ruined the whole film","As a character the sheriffe ruined the whole movie.. Don't watch it. I'm sure you will disappoint"
"2516","The Silencing",10,"Simple but worth it","Definitely worth the watch Ang couldn't have got better actors to play the parts, One off the better films I've seen in 2020"
"2517","The Silencing",8,"The King Slayer is back","Glad to see Nikolaj Coster-Waldau is back. His acting is quite good in this film as well as the whole feel of this film. Good thriller with great plot twist. I didn't see the ending coming. The only con I can say is that the movie never reveals the story behind why the incisions in the victims. Don't worry, not giving away anything since its one of the first things we are presented with.I want to see more Jamie Lannister on screen. Make it happen!"
"2518","The Silencing",3,"The logic is not strong with this one.","There were so many plot conveniences, unmotivated actions, plain stupid decisions, and even a few blatantly impossible inconsistencies, and unfortunately Nikolaj Coster-Waldau's (admittedly decent) performance can't save it. I was also very disappointed in Annabelle Wallis's performance, as I really liked her in Peaky Blinders. She somehow manages to sound bored while holding a killer at gunpoint.
The film's only other saving grace is the gorgeous scenery."
"2519","The Silencing",8,"NO driving after drinking !","Good leson! nice story! ... but why was the girls have that scar on neck? purpose?"
"2520","The Silencing",5,"Budget flick let down by the budget.","First, it was watchable. Made it all the way through w/o the usual fast-forwards. BUT - sloppy directing, really bad editing, and stone-faced acting. The premise and area shooting carried it for me. Nice and misty murky feel, but as others have noted, the characters did not seem to make real-life decisions, and most were just too stoic (read: what do I do with that line?). The twist at the end, in my opinion, wasn't realistic, and certainly the killer would have been caught long before in real life. Nevertheless, suspenseful and spooky enough to watch it through."
"2521","The Silencing",6,"Silent Slow Crime Mystery packed film","Not that my level of Crime Mystery film, not enjoyed much. Just complete it for Game of Thrones hero sake."
"2522","Raat Akeli Hai",10,"Content we want from Bollywood !! Just mind blowing !!","Nawazuddin and Radhika!! Two gems of Bollywood and their chemistry is must watch ,
Awesome acting and story , best Dark crime mystery drama !!"
"2523","Raat Akeli Hai",8,"Dark Murder Mystery...Indian Cinema is Evolving..!!!","Indian cinema has undergone transition recently. Recognition of character actors, experimenting directors and writers has brought a long awaited pleasant change. The movie is a great representation of all that.Positives:
Solid casting, no big names yet powerful and suitable actors chosen. Nawazuddin, Radhika, Tigmanshu and many more are all one of the finest actors in India and they definitely deliver a punch.
Story although a bit Poirotesque but still beautifully written. The slow build culminating into a big finale is crafted with precision. May be inspired by Agatha Christie's style where everyone is a suspect, but still the suspense is created and kept me guessing till the very end. The curtain raiser we had, I never saw it coming. The love story woven into a murder mystery may sound Bollywoodish but that doesn't derail the plot.Negatives:
The songs had no place in the movie and seemed a bit out of place. They tried to do Gangs of Wasseypur here by even going with off beat and classical lyrics, but things did not click.Conclusion:
Good thriller and a right step into right direction by Indian cinema. Time to recognise good actors and movie-plots rather than going for spicy formula and celebrity actors."
"2524","Raat Akeli Hai",10,"Nawazuddin Siddiqui does it again.","What a phenomenal actor. Nawaz bhai is the living example for the industry to prove that you don't have to be a body builder or anything like that to be successful. Anyway sacred games still tops the list... Love to Nawazuddin Siddiqui from sikkim India... God bless..."
"2525","Raat Akeli Hai",9,"We need more directors like Honey Trehan.","For starters it resembles alot with ""Knives Out"" but then it's more than that. What ""Lunchbox"" made us feel I'm sure this must have the same impact. And I don't need to say anything about the cast, it's that obvious."
"2526","Raat Akeli Hai",10,"Social Drama warped with Thriller","Released in Netflix today. Just Watched it and loved the film.This is a thriller specifically Who done it thriller but it gives a strong message about male dominated situation of society, and about the violence against the women in our society. So it is kind of a SOCIAL DRAMA warped by A THRILLER. Which is kind of a new or Unusual approach. Also the Dark Comedy of the film was so enjoyable.Thriller portion is very engaging. Whole Cinema has a Dark Tone Which was awesome.Cinematography is also superb. It is the first feature film of director as a debutant his direction is also very good.Now coming to the best section Which is acting. Nawaz is outstanding as Inspector Jatil Jadav. His charecter has some complexions and layers. Also Radhika Apte & others are too good.
Only negetive points are, there are some loopholes in the screenplay and a bit stretched. But performances completely covered those.It is a must watch for those who likes good content."
"2527","Raat Akeli Hai",8,"Pure Murder mystry","Nawazuddin Siddiqui, and Radhika at their best.. But the main hero is screenplay. And Awesome cinematography... Every one have their own dark secret.."
"2528","Raat Akeli Hai",8,"More Than Just A Murder Mystery","From the trailer you can assume that this is a whodunnit thriller, But after watching the film you'll realise that it is more than a murder mystery. The casting is so strong that there is nothing to say about it's acting performence.Debutant director Honey Trehan has done a very good job in his first film. Cinematography by Pankaj Kumar and music of Sneha Khanwalkar is undoubtedly exceptional.The only problem of the film is it's duration. It could be well edited. Otherwise it's a fine experiment."
"2529","Raat Akeli Hai",7,"Netflix's Indian original content has been rescued.","After some awful series and films, Netflix India at least has provided us a watchable movie. Not a great one. Yet watchable."
"2530","Raat Akeli Hai",10,"<U+0001F525> Must watch .......","When 2 gems like Nawazuddin and Radhika were casted,the destiny of this dark thriller was already written...bdw the movie is marvelous with various twists...a complete entertainment with strong story,acting,scripts and thrill...A must watch."
"2531","Raat Akeli Hai",9,"Brilliant","Indian answer to knives out .. and a brilliant one ."
"2532","Raat Akeli Hai",7,"Raat Akeli Hai: Dark SlowBurn Engaging","First of all welcome Radhika apte ;)
Netflix been hit hard by amazon prime and other platforms this year. The 1st good indian content from netflix was Bulbbul and now Raat Akeli Hai.
No doubt this is a one man show i.e. Nawaz bhai. He single handedly run this movie he had 90% of the screen time.
Radhika apte done fanastic work.
Other casts such as Nishant , Shivani ,Shweta played their really well.
Movie is slow 20 to 30 mins less would have been good. This is a single time watch thriller."
"2533","Raat Akeli Hai",7,"A good one time watch thriller","Good to see something worthwhile come from Netflix India after such a long while. Movie is a good thriller with decent pacing and realistic characters noting over the top. Performances are perhaps what saves this movie Nawazuddin, Radhika, Ila Arun,Tigmanshu & aditya Srivastava bring life to their characters.Shweta, Nishant & shivani should've had more screen time. Only drawback is script which I thought was somewhat patchy and could've been better written. Also Netflix needs to come out of its sacred games hangover and explore other ideas.TlDr: One time watch thriller with good performance & okaish script."
"2534","Raat Akeli Hai",8,"Twisty and compulsively watchable","Twisty and compulsively watchable, even though it is convoluted in parts and way too long. But an excellent story and pitch perfect performances, particularly from Siddique and Apte, raises its bar."
"2535","Raat Akeli Hai",7,"Nawazuddin's Knives out","The Screenplay is too slow in First hour but it picks up pace later. Story is quite routine but the way it develops makes it interesting. Nawazuddin is too good. Radhika Apte did well. People in Large mansions have too many secrets. Mystery and suspense maintained well. Rest other characters are okay! Give it a quick watch. Recommended. Interesting one !"
"2536","Raat Akeli Hai",10,"Must watch movie","Plss go and watch it .. i love this movie . And solve the murder mystery. Its fantastic murder mystery."
"2537","Raat Akeli Hai",10,"Do Watch.","Nawaz Sir rocks as always,radhika was too good.whole cast nailed it <U+0001F525>.
In my opinion just do watch this film."
"2538","Raat Akeli Hai",10,"Loved it!","Brilliant story, Longed for more. The twist was something which blew my mind. Top notch acting. With this star cast, will be hard work to get it wrong. Dialogue delivery by Nawazuddin, heaven. Definitely recommend everyone to watch it. Amazing message too. Netflix, you have aced with this one."
"2539","Raat Akeli Hai",10,"A must watch movie","A dark murder mystery with many twist and turns on its engaging screenplay..Cinematography and BGM of the movie is excellent<U+2764>... All of the casts have given very strong performances, specially Nawaz and Radhika<U+0001F49C>... Last 30 mins of this film is just<U+0001F525><U+0001F525>...Honey Trehan has done a great job as a debutant director.. Give it a watch guys, I really loved it<U+2764>...
P. S-(It is not a desi version of ""Knives out"")"
"2540","Raat Akeli Hai",6,"Tension does weaken at times but interesting overall","I love murder mystery films and this film does manage to keep your attention whilst giving an interesting insight into the nature of men and women.Raat Akeli Hai follows Jatil Yadav, a police officer who investigates the murder of the patriarch of a wealthy family.It may sound like Knives Out and the film does have a few similarities to it but Raat Akeli Hai is certainly different in terms its tone and themes. For the most part, this film is engaging. Debutant director Honey Trehan does manage to keep the audience interested but it does run into a few bumps along the way. There are some scenes sprinkled with humour here and there but for the most part there is a dark feeling to the film. Pankaj Kumar, who did the cinematography for Tumbbad, does a good job here especially during a scene that takes place under a bridge.Smita Singh's script is interesting as she questions the nature of men and the treatment of women and it's done in a way that's not preachy which is commendable. The main problems lie in the editing. It's a 2 hour 30 minute film and at places the tension does dilute. What really annoyed me were the song placements as they really weakened the intensity and tension. If a couple more minutes were trimmed off, then the pacing would feel faster.The ensemble cast is solid. Nawazuddin Siddiqui delivers another fabulous performance. Ila Arun provided more of the humourous scenes and worked well with Siddiqui. Radhika Apte was great. Aditya Shrivastav and Tigmanshu Dhulia did well and Padmavati Rao is terrific. The rest of the supporting cast also do a good job.Raat Akeli Hai is definitely not perfect but it's a decent attempt at a whodunnit and Honey Trehan is a promising director."
"2541","Raat Akeli Hai",9,"Must watch suspense thriller","Loved it.. you can't guess till the last moment. A must watch"
"2542","Raat Akeli Hai",10,"Thriller Murder Mystery!! Must watch <U+0001F44F>","Mind boggling murder mystery, exceptional performances by everyone. Courageous role of Nawazuddin Siddiqui and Radhika Apte. Super <U+0001F497>"
"2543","Raat Akeli Hai",8,"Intriguing","Movie is nicely made, holds you till the end. Brilliant performance by everyone. As usual Nawaz is excellent."
"2544","Raat Akeli Hai",10,"A perfect Murder Mystery that was required in Bollywood","Honey Trehan successfully constructs a thriller, which becomes more than just a whodunit, tense and interesting from the word go.Nawazuddin Siddiqui, like any of his other films or series, delivers a strong performance as the no nonsense, headstrong cop, Jatil Yadav. Radhika Apte as Radha also delivers a terrific performance. Aditya Srivastava, Tigmanshu Dhulia and other supporting actors also shines efficiently in the film.Raat Akeli Hai isn't only about the writing and the acting. The other inputs, too, are of the highest order. A brilliant narrative, effective cinematography and a brilliant performance from the Lead as well as the supporting cast makes the movie an achievement in Mystery/suspense movie genres.
My Rating : 5/5"
"2545","Raat Akeli Hai",10,"Excellent acting and Netflix India revival","Excellent acting by Nawaz, felt like a proper method acting. He was into the police role. Radhika Apte should among the very few bollywood actress who can act, without getting pulled by just glamour. Angry acting as always, but excellently suites a strong female role.
Mivie though could have easily been 30 to 40 mins less. Fast forwarded quite a bit to get to ending after the unrawel started"
"2546","Raat Akeli Hai",10,"Excellent Murder mystry thriller....","Excellent content...a must watch murder mystery thriller...plot well organised....frames were excellent throughout the movie....And performance by Nawaz and Radhika were above par...And hats of to director - Honey Trehan for this excellent gem....."
"2547","Raat Akeli Hai",10,"BOB BISWAS of Raat akeli Hai","Raat Akeli Hai is an excellent watch of Whodunit genre.. Everyone is excellent... Nawaz, Radhika... all the known names performed well.. But for me one character stands out... He doesn't have a dialogue in movie.. He speaks through his eyes.. It sends chills down your spine... His walk... will make you run out of fear... You will love to hate him seeing his potrayal of that nameless character.. He is to RAH what Bob biswas was to KAHAANI... I was curious who that actor is?... After some research got to know he is RAVI SAH... a ftii trained talent from a small town called purnea in Bihar.. Congratulations man... You were outstanding in that small role.. You made your presence felt in opening sequence itself.. Looking forward for many more <U+0001F44D><U+0001F44D><U+0001F490>"
"2548","Raat Akeli Hai",5,"Good suspense flim with average","Performance of all actors were good and nawaz was just fabulous and the whole movie strategy of suspense is all and somewhere flim changes its track but it is a good flim . One time watchable"
"2549","Raat Akeli Hai",10,"A very much needed crime thriller","With an amazing acting skills for the characters of Jatil, Munna, ssp lalit, Vikram, Vasudha, Radha,Chunni, Karuna and all the remaining once, this movie delivers a very crisp multi murder story. Story points created so well, that we can not find any loop holes in it. A class cinematography, a screenplay written so well, that the movie has a tendency to keep audience with it for the whole time. A very good crime thriller movie delivered after Andhadhun"
"2550","Raat Akeli Hai",9,"Very Well Executed !!!","Nawazuddin Siddiqui does it again. Exceptionally well in all aspects and character of ""Inspector Jatil Yadav"". Radhika Apte supported equally to Nawazuddin Siddiqui. Also supported actors does there job. But it was all Nawazuddin and Radhika's Show. They were up to the mark. A Dark Crime mystery very well executed.
The last 1hr of the movie should not be missed at any cost.
Really it was a mind stellar performance by Nawazuddin Siddiqui and Radhika Apte."
"2551","Raat Akeli Hai",9,"A delightful watch with a blend of star casts!","As always, Nwazuddin, with his appearance, delivers an original treat! Well, Radhika and Sweta backed the screen fantastically. A small & cameo inclusion through Tigmanshu adds a flavor to watch. A dark mystery crime projected through the movie is well delivered - Beautifully portraying racial discrimination and patriarchy. The story screen keeps you engaged with its foggy mystery on and off; throughout the movie. While, there is always room for thick and thin improvements. Overall, I wholly enjoyed the movie being a big fan of potential star casts! Not to be the spoiler alert, one can spot the clue in the begining, if you are a street smart! Watch it to read through your brain!"
"2552","Raat Akeli Hai",9,"Shudh Desi masterpiece of a Thriller","When it comes to Bollywood sleuth thrillers one cannot help but think it has to be a rip off of a Hollywood or Korean movie. Such is the lack of originality in this genre of film making. But Raat Akeli Hai slowly detaches itself from any similar film and comes out as an engaging 2hr 30min ride of crime and detection and packs a twisted twist in the end. Glad finally Bollywood is offering something for the Holmes and Poirot fans. Its one of the best films of 2020. Rather one of the best things of 2020."
"2553","Raat Akeli Hai",9,"It's an awesome movie in every aspect and it's more than murder mystery","I loved every aspect of the movie detailing of characters, the whole acting cast of the movie , acting perfomance of everyone. But the film is too long (2hr 30 minutes) that's the only thing I don't hate but it could have been cut short at least 15-20 minutes."
"2554","Raat Akeli Hai",10,"Fantastic movie!!!! Nawazuddin was superb!!","Excellent script and well acted crew. Once again Nawazuddin was show stiller. A well organized movie revolving around a basic murder conspiracy. I would say have seen good murder mystery movie after a long long time. Truly refreshing its a must watch movie."
"2555","Raat Akeli Hai",4,"it becomes a headache after sometime","All performances are good, casting is good, but unnecessarily they stretch the suspense so long that it looses its grip and excitement and it starts paining in head."
"2556","Raat Akeli Hai",7,"Only because nawaz and radhika worked in this movie .","Story is very simple but interesting. One time watch ."
"2557","Raat Akeli Hai",10,"Better than what I expected.","Indian cinema is evolving and this movie is a good example."
"2558","Raat Akeli Hai",9,"Intelligent cinema doesn't require superstars but needs only actors who can fill voids through their silence","Nawazuddin's performance is brilliant! All actors have portrayed their parts beautifully. Storytelling, plot & direction excellent. Must watch. Great movie. Knives out grade"
"2559","Raat Akeli Hai",6,"Started strong but slow pace ruined it.","Start was intriguing and it was really engaging for the first hour but then the slow pace became a headache, it was decent overall however its not very well directed, story was decent and it keeps you guessing but it was not as good as I expected it to be."
"2560","Raat Akeli Hai",9,"Finally a Substantial Indian movie on Netflix!!!","Being an Indian, I barely watch Indian Cinema. That zeal was lost after Bollywood went down the drain post 2005. Gave this movie a chance and wasnt disappointed:-
Pros:
SiddiquiHumor between mom and sonPlot & How characters are tied togetherAnd how the mystery is unfurled at the endCons
Length.. Could have been 25 minutes shorterPredictable and a bit cliched at timesRadhika Apte showing her cleavage in almost every sceneSomewhat similar to 'Knives Out'I enjoyed it.. Its a one time watch. Its way better than similar Hollywood WhoDunits which I have watched in dozens.
Its definitely not worth a 10 or a 9, But I gave it a 9 when I read 1-4 star diabolical reviews. Those guys simply having no idea why they were giving it a 1. Some of the reviews are funny and even non-sensical to the core.Has its FLAWS, But This is a GOOD Movie, with a SOLID Plot and Some Decent acting by Siddiqui which could have been shorter by 20 minutes. A One Time Watch"
"2561","Raat Akeli Hai",7,"Good watch","It's a good crime thriller but the romance angle was unnecessary."
"2562","Raat Akeli Hai",7,"Good movie","The movie has the nice story, the end is little poor but okay with it. But one thing is why there is Narendra Modi's photograph in the police station?? He's not the freedom fighter."
"2563","Raat Akeli Hai",10,"A big influence from Satyajit Ray films","Yes you might find the story to be influenced by Knives out. True.
But the CINEMATOGRAPHY and the elements are very much influenced from Satyajit Ray's Feluda movies specially 'Sonar Kella'Well it is not bad to copy the best filmmaker India has ever produced Satyajit Ray. GOOGLE HIM"
"2564","Raat Akeli Hai",9,"Brilliant and exquisite","Nawaz bhai is a gem <U+0001F48E> , director, screenplay everything is superb, brilliant movie..."
"2565","Raat Akeli Hai",9,"One of best neo noirs in recent times","This movie is without a doubt one of the best thrillers to release in a OTT.
The characters, casting everything was on point.
The storyline was full of surprises and the I'll remember the climax for a long time to come.
Definitely a good watch."
"2566","Raat Akeli Hai",10,"Nawazuddin Splendid Performance!!!!","Must watch full of suspense and thrill great narrative and all actors done there job perfectly Netflix has come with a very good hindi movie after along time"
"2567","Raat Akeli Hai",8,"OLD STORY LINE BUT SHOWED IN A INTERESTING WAY ...MUST WATCH","Basically it a story of murder investigation..........with some good twist......must watch ........for thriller and murder mystery fans ......one extra star for the acting of the whole cast..and direction"
"2568","Raat Akeli Hai",8,"Good thriller movie","Good movie to watch for especially the dark murder mystery and a fabulous performance from all characters it's a great movie no doubt."
"2569","Raat Akeli Hai",9,"Great acting, great supporting actors..","Production quality of the movie doesn't lives upto the benchmark set by International Netflix Originals... Budgetary restraints could have been the cause of it.. but overall the movie is worth your time.. do watch it coz the acting prowess of the cast is just mind blowing.."
"2570","Raat Akeli Hai",10,"Great Plot, Screenplay and Acting!!","Every actor in the movie plays his/her part so beautifully that it feels like a masterpiece. Don't watch it if you just want a great crime mystery, you might have seen better. Specially for those who are crime movie/novel fanatics, the climax may not be too surprising or shocking. What makes this movie great is the amazing acting and the little stories hidden in the journey of solving the case. The movie might seem to be a little on the longer side,but it's not due to stupid songs or unnecessary screen time given to showcase the lead couple romancing in the woods. That is one reason that the movie doesn't feel like a drag. The movie addresses some grave social issues to which the onscreen cast appears nonchalant but the message reaches the audience loud and clear. Their are no long lectures/speeches at the end of the movie about how our society is so wrong and what should change. But the emotions say it all. It's just amazing.
All in all, this movie is a great watch for those who appreciate the subtle humour, sarcasm, despair along with a good storyline."
"2571","Raat Akeli Hai",9,"Raat Akeli Hai is... a killer thriller","NETFLIX'S RAAT AKELI HAI is simply outstanding. Honey Trehan's directorial debut is an ultimate desi crime thriller that will mysteriously mesmerize you from start to finish. The runtime of almost 2.5hrs will not bother you as the story along with fine performances by one of the assembled star cast will keep you engaged till the end.It was a refreshing sight to see Nawazuddin as Inspector Jatil Yadav who is fearless but also, less confident about his looks and being single. His equation with his simple but witty mother, effortlessly played by Ila Arun, highlights the normal and relatable life of an Indian cop that has been glorified by these over the top antics of all the Chulbul's and Singham's of our Bollywood. He delivers a performance that is beyond looks and physical stature. It is about body language, dialogue delivery, and his acting. Nothing else and thank god for that.Jatil is sent to investigate the murder of a rich guy and he immediately senses that the family members a hiding something as they all have reasons to kill. This is when we are introduced to this magnificent star cast of the movie including the ravishing Radhika Apte.
The chemistry between Nawaz and Radhika is off the chart and sply, the end scene was a whistle worthy short for all those 'Nawaz-Radhika' fans... no spoilers, please!Nawaz's act is one of a kind. He is far away from any fun and humor in his life but has a strong determination to do his job with complete honesty. Radhika, on the other hand, looks so genuine and effortless. And did i say that there is no trace of overacting..at all?Honey has utilized his experience as the casting director to choose the line up of fine actors including Tigmanshu Dhulia, Shweta Tripathi, Shivani Raghuvanshi, Nishant Dahiya, Ila Arun, Swanand Kirkire, Aditya Srivastava. It was a treat to see such talent coming together and also, played their roles with complete honesty.The darkness referred to in the title is felt throughout the movie. The visuals, the twists all of it has this dark tonality that only brightens up the narration. There are no dull moments till the climax where the revealing part of the murder mystery was conveyed just like that. Don't get me wrong as i have no intention to see over the top melodrama kind of nonsense. It was too simple.It is a killer thriller that deserves a second watch and bug time recommendation to anyone looking for a terrific crime thriller."
"2572","Raat Akeli Hai",9,"Gripping thriller with amazing story","I liked the entire story line and different characters In this ""whodunit"" thriller. Once again Nawazuddin Siddiqui has proven his mettle, Radihika Apte is good as well. The only comment is about the length of the movie which could have been a bit shorter."
"2573","Raat Akeli Hai",10,"Amazing","A true quality content. No bollywood craps , good directed and cinematographed. Worth a watch"
"2574","Raat Akeli Hai",10,"Amazing Movie, Amazing Story, Amazing Ending","You should watch this movie right nowww!!!
And the ones who say it is desi version of Knives Out then, they had till now not watched this movie or they have only watched it's trailer. But I need to say, this gets include in Best Indian Suspense Thriller..."
"2575","Raat Akeli Hai",8,"One of best thriller","Superb acting, crisp screen play, real location shoot in Kanpur.One of best thriller after very long time im bollywood.
Its reminded me Abhay Deol fame ""Manorama Six feet Under"".Thanks Netflix and Creator's :)"
"2576","Raat Akeli Hai",9,"A well written fabulous thriller.","It feels like just keep watching there will be more drama hidden"
"2577","Raat Akeli Hai",8,"Thriller treat!","If you love a movie with twists and turns, this is surely a must watch. What I love about the movie is, you end up doubting every character as they all have a reason to commit the crime. You are almost assured of who the killer is and then voila! There's a twist and then you start reconnecting the dots all again and everything falls into place.All the characters have acted really well. Loved it!"
"2578","Raat Akeli Hai",9,"Brilliant","The people who are saying it's a cheap copy of Knives Out - YOU COULDN'T BE MORE WRONG!! It's nothing to do with knives out and even if we're to compare these two movies, Raat akeli.... Wins hands down!!!"
"2579","Raat Akeli Hai",10,"Wow what a masterpiece","This man can play any any anyyyy character, Nawazuddin siddqui and Radhika apte at their brilliant best with some awesome direction must watch"
"2580","Raat Akeli Hai",5,"Eww plot","Great cinematography and always good to see Nawazuddin Siddiqui on the screen. But the plot is ridiculously far fetched and overly convoluted. It feels like the screenwriter tried to fit in every passing idea she had into the story without getting the script proofread by a second pair of eyes. The movie drags on for over 2 hours with you feeling zero connection with any of the other 20 odd characters on the screen. Take the two famous lead actors out and this film seen threadbare is an atrociously bad one. It had potential though, but wasted."
"2581","Raat Akeli Hai",5,"Slow pitch boring","Slow and boring too slow. Murder Mistry. No pitch not griping"
"2582","Raat Akeli Hai",6,"But for Nawaz, it's a forgettable movie!","The movie is so long and tedious that you lose the thrill of a thriller. Performances are stellar but plot, storyline and bad editing leaves you wanting for more. Net net, a better attempt by Netflix to stage a comeback compared to other series this year but not a must watch!"
"2583","Raat Akeli Hai",7,"Actually 7.5/10","Medium paced murder mystery.
Not a slow one nor engaging.Length of the movie is first problem , they should have reduced some 15mins+. It would have moved fast.Acting is good overall. Love portion some may feel unwanted , yes it's unwanted it would have been more engaging if it s eliminated or put an unexpected twist but a different one.If u r thinking about watching this movie , don't have high expectations, it s a decent watch."
"2584","Raat Akeli Hai",7,"A good thriller !!!","Bollywood has very limited strong thriller movies especially while handling murder mysteries bollywood has failed in the past, but raat akeli turns out to break that. Good crime thriller with some good performances by the star cast."
"2585","Raat Akeli Hai",10,"Evolving Indian Cinema","Raat Akeli Hai along with Bulbbul are two completely different genres that have been reinvented in how they have been presented to the Indian audience so far. Performances by Nawazuddin Siddiqui and Radhika Apte as usual stand out. A new star Nishant Dahiya also delivers an unbelievable performance.The plot is nearly spotless but with some pacing issues as the film unnecessarily drags on for 2.5 hrs. Could have been paced faster and the tension kept harder throughout the film. Nonetheless it never felt like it was losing its grip over its audience. Depiction of Uttar Pradesh and its continuing social backwardness along with its corrupt police and political system serves to provide a strong context for the film too. It just feels natural that something like this would happen in UP."
"2586","Raat Akeli Hai",9,"Great Acting, but slow pace execution, Worth The Watch! Need more movies like this","Movie is literally amazing but, slow development.Movie doesn't keep you sitting, I would say it slightly draggy but great story-line. worth the watch. I watched it cause of Nawazuddin Siddiqui and Radhika Apte. This are the 2 actor which are true actor of Hindi Cinema.Shivani Raghuvanshi did a good job too, it was mediocre but, better than any other A-grade bollywood actor. ILLA ARUN! after long-time able to see you in the movie. Good Actor's combination. Need more movies like this"

<U+0001F4DC> Plot: Plot revolves around a Small town cop who is summoned to investigate the death of a politician which gets complicated by the victim's secretive family making him desperate to solve it.

<U+0001F468><U+200D><U+2696><U+FE0F> Review : Raat Akeli Hai is in all terms a well made slow burner. The movie ends the drought of a good indian movie from Netflix India and who better than Nawaz and Radhika Apte , the favourites of Netflix. The Movie Is Engaging for most parts and is well written with crisp screenplay. This investigative murder mystery is easily one of the few good bollywood movies this year.Nawazuddin as Jatil Yadav is exceptional as he caries the entire movie on his shoulder. His improvisations, his raw acting , his dominance while staging a shot reflects throughout the entire course. Radhika Apte is at her usual best , brave yet powerless she is brilliant. The Best part of the movie is the cute banters between Jatil's mom Ila Arun and Jatil which are highly relatable. With a brilliant ensemble cast this movie is meticulously detailed by the Director Honey Trehan and framed by Smita Singh. Impactful performances add up and you get a classy thriller.The only let down is the drags along the way of a really long 149min runtime. The songs were unnecessary which Completely lets the momentum down. The Irrelevant and Unpleasant Love Angle seems to not fit in this such engaging subject is what i felt. Apart from this its a definite one time watch.
.
.
<U+0001F44D>Goods :
1. Nawaz is Outstanding , Masterful.
2. Ila Arun and Nawaz Banters.
3. Convincing Climax.
.
.
<U+0001F44E> Bads :
1. Songs and Love Angle
2. Runtime , could have been tightly edited.
.
.
<U+0001F525> Final Rating : 7.5/10
.
.
<U+2705> Verdict : Fine Comback by Netflix India. If you have already seen Knives Out and you loved it. This is the more lighter version of it and is actually good except for a few dips. Enjoy This One. <U+0001F44C>

"2589","Raat Akeli Hai",10,"Amazing Movie","What an amazing movie. Superb acting by everyone in the team. Good suspense and brilliant direction.It is such a shame people don't treat the underrated actors with respect. Brilliant performance overall.Must watch !!"
"2590","Raat Akeli Hai",10,"Must watch movie","Screenplay is brilliant , actors Brilliant , cinematography superb, what i like about cinematography is everything looks so real , yes there are few mistakes in lighting and one mistake I found in bike and car chasing scene, when he fire with gun and one bullet hits the drum, how can one bullet makes two hols in Water drum <U+0001F923>"
"2591","Raat Akeli Hai",8,"A family with lots of dark secrets is a dysfunctional family","What worked:
screenplay; it's a fresh and engaging story, which has been executed beautifully. The content is rich, and the narrative style raises the bar in the Bollywood film making. The movie has layers of plots and subplots each with their own mission, and at the end of the movie we are satisfied with the overall presentation. Of course, there are some unanswered questions but the movie as a whole works great. I am fascinated with the editing and cinematography of the movie, both done beautifully. Nawasuddin bags one more appreciation with this movie.What did not work:
runtime; I do agree that the runtime could have been shorten down considering a movie with a thin narrative but also we need to appreciate its engaging. Some scenes could have been taken out.complexity; although the narrative of the movie raises the bar, is brilliantly executed, it might be too much for a mass audience. The movie is so rich in its content and subplots which is actually a great aspect but might be a bad move for some who is used to light thrillers.Final verdict: recommended, watch it when you are mentally calm and open to experiences"
"2592","Raat Akeli Hai",10,"excellent screenplay","I have'nt seen such movie in few past and and speciallly in bollybood ....... this movie has well written screenplay and the hard work of director also can be seen in ecery seen ..... background music was ok ok means good ..... overall movie experience was ver good"
"2593","Raat Akeli Hai",5,"Meh...","Premise of the movie is good. Acting is mainly very good specially from NawazBut, the writing and direction is where the film loses it. Being a murder mystery, it plays out less like a murder mystery but, more like a policeman who is just running around threatening people and having an affair with one of the suspects.There is no systematic approach to the investigation. Not once the crime scene is shown in full clarity. The investigator doesn't even search the house properly for any clues. He is just talking to people of the house and delivering great dialogues. How the investigator reaches his conclusion is also not very clear. Just looks like a bunch of scenes put together, and out of the blue he has it all figured out.Poorly written murder mystery"
"2594","Raat Akeli Hai",7,"Nice movie","Performance wise everyone did fantastic job, specially aditya Shrivastava's performance is brilliant in movie, obviously Nawaz and radhika both did great in movie. Story wasn't intresting enough but story keeps you engaged, specially sound effect on movie is really good they are on point and gives nice experience."
"2595","Raat Akeli Hai",6,"Moderate spaced thriller with some mundane twists","Acting is good overall . If you are a thriller /mystery fan , you might want to watch this movie , but be prepared to endure some melodrama which were kind of turn offs for me . For an international audience , this will not appeal much because of its sheer length ( too long with some mundane sub plots )."
"2596","Raat Akeli Hai",9,"You will remember Jatil Yadav","The movie stretched a bit in the middle - but nonetheless outstanding effort. Nawaz is awesome as Jatil Yadav - esp 'yaha jo kaand hua hai' scene and his banters with Ila Arun as the mom - he's effortless yet dominates. The film is also a commentary on patriarchy and general wasteland feeling of cow belt small town. By the end, one is less interested in who commited the crime but moved by the gross scheunfraude state of the key characters.
Fresh breath of Netflix India. Please create more content like this"
"2597","Raat Akeli Hai",7,"Good but not as expected.","Nawaz sir and radhika mam were great. Both were very comfortable with their role and played 9/10. The drawback is the film doesn't come with much twists, it looks thriller in the starting but it doesn't get any twists. Only in the ending the twists get unfolded in a matter of 10 minutes. Overall the movie carries a rating of 6.5 till the last half an hour and then it's rating become 7.5 in that last half an hour."
"2598","Raat Akeli Hai",7,"Another stellar performance by NAWAZ bhai","The train picks up the speed to a thriller climax..STORY : average (2.5/5)SCREENPLAY & DIALOGUE : good (3/5)(Note : Dialogues needed to be brilliant which is written by Smita Singh )ACTING : brilliant performance by Nawaz(nailed the role), Radhika, Shivani Raghuvanshi (she has done a fabulous job) , Aditya Srivastava.DIRECTION : direction by HONEY TREHAN is perfect but direction splits into monotonous & pumped up screenplay in the last 35 mins. Not the director's mistake cuz the script needed more potential but NAWAZUDDIN SIDDIQUI took everything on his shoulder.Overall stars : 7.5/10 (one time watch)"
"2599","Raat Akeli Hai",9,"Brilliant acting and direction.","So many talents in one frame. All have done their best."
"2600","Raat Akeli Hai",8,"Good one time watch","The movie has its weak moments: The beginning and somewhere towards the last 40 mins but it picks up pace. Stellar performances by Nawazuddin and Radhika Apte. Their screen presence will surely keep you hooked. The suspense builds up slowly. The casting is too good. Apart from few weak moments, this is easily one of the best movies released in 2020."
"2601","Raat Akeli Hai",9,"Fabulous movie","A wonderful movie with many twists. Talented cast, intriguing storyline and marvellous execution have made this one a ripper!"
"2602","Raat Akeli Hai",10,"One of the best Indian suspense thriller movie. Highly recommended.","This movie can easily be considered one of the best suspense thriller movie not only in India but also among world cinema. Not a single moment was dull or flimsy.. Nawazuddin Siddiqui is terrific as always. Rest starcast have done really commendable job. Kudos to the filmmaker for such a spellbinding movie. We cinema lovers from India deserve such contents from India indian cinema."
"2603","Raat Akeli Hai",8,"Nawaz Ud Din!!","Majority of guys were watching this movie just because of Nawaz ud din and he didn't disappointed us. His performance was just sublime as he done if before"
"2604","Raat Akeli Hai",8,"Great performances","Good performances and overall a good watch. Movie is a bit long, but it goes well with story and everyone has done a good work in the movie. Direction and screenplays are getting top notch!"
"2605","Raat Akeli Hai",7,"A must watch dark slow-burn thriller.","A must watch dark slow-burn thriller.
Great performances by the entire cast, with Nawaz leading all the way. Only con is the shoddy editing that packs some needless stuff in the middle of the movie taking the runtime to 149 mins. (7/10)"
"2606","Raat Akeli Hai",8,"Great suspense with good story","The film is somewhere inspired by the knives out but this film has a Bollywood twist to it and it's very hard to make a film that great with such twist .. but the makers did a good job<U+0001F44D> .. ultimately you can watch the film with your family and will definitely enjoy this film. Thank you."
"2607","Raat Akeli Hai",9,"Gripping film with an explosive climax!!","Movie review: Raat Akeli Hai streaming on Netflix
#sanjuzzreviewsSet in Kanpur where age old traditions like chauvinism, patriarchy are still a part of the orthodox society, Raat Akeli Hai is a gripping whodunit which is Bollywood's answer to Daniel Craig's Knives Out & wow... it is bang on target!!
A powerful & politically connected man Raghubeer Singh is found murdered on the night of his wedding to his mistress Radhika Apte. Every person in the house is a potential suspect with a motive for murder.
Enter inspector Jatil Yadav ( Nawazuddin Siddiqui) who is tasked with solving the case and uncovering the truth. As the honest cop goes about his investigation, he uncovers startling facts which culminate in an explosive climax.
The film exposes the nexus between the politicians and police and actually make you wonder about the authenticity of investigations carried out.
Do we really want the actual truth to come out or the convenient version which is palatable and easy to digest.
Narrative, cinematography & script score big time in making this a very crisp and rivetting thriller.
First half is where the male cast dominates the proceeding but it is the second half where the vulnerability, frustration and helplessness of the female cast is brought to the fore. Not seen too often.The film has light moments too like the banter between Nawazuddin and his mother Ila Arun over difficulties in finding a suitable girl for him. Lightens the mood a bit without digressing from the plot.Nawazuddin and Apte give stellar performances. So do the rest of the cast which includes Aditya Shrivastava(Abhijeet from CID), Tigmanshu Dhulia & Shweta Tripathi and others.Even though it is a desi take on Knives Out, I could related the storyline more to Manorama- Six Feet Under, another must watch film. Please go ahead and watch it, you will not feel disappointed for sure."
"2608","Raat Akeli Hai",7,"Suspenseful","Kind of reminded me of Knives Out. Slow paced but has a good story. Good acting performances. The ending was good but took a little hard to understand everything."
"2609","Raat Akeli Hai",9,"Slow burner masterpiece","It was a well crafted murder mystery movie. I like the slow burners that are worth the wait and this was exactly that. The actors were amazing, not only the headliners but also the ones having small screentime. Nawaz was phenomenal."
"2610","Raat Akeli Hai",10,"Superb story and nawaz's acting is mind-blowing","Different kind of story with lots of twists and turns..must watch."
"2611","Raat Akeli Hai",9,"Thriller","Superb acting by Nawaz and Radhika. Nail biting movie and a suspense thriller till the very end. Worth watching."
"2612","Raat Akeli Hai",9,"reminded me of..","This movie reminded me of the recent thriller mystery knives out Hollywood film. The story is not exactly the same but a lot of teams and the plot resembles the knives out. I am not sure if this was a coincidence or was it be inspired.Nevertheless this is a great mystery thriller that I enjoyed from start to finish."
"2613","Raat Akeli Hai",10,"Well written, directed, produced , acted","Yet again Nawaz, Radhika and the whole team have put a beautiful suspense together. Every frame was nicely weaven. A must watch."
"2614","Raat Akeli Hai",8,"Engaging Story, But..","Gotta say I enjoyed it immensely. It's hard to find a good whodunnit which doesn't try to overdo the theatrics nor undersell the climax. The ending was very well penned, kudos to the writers and direction!The only issue I had with this was considering the duration of the Movie, a good 150 minutes, I felt it dragged in places, certain elements felt unnecessary initially but came up later as good plot points. It would have made a lot more sense if they would have released like a 3 episode series rather than a full length movie. It would have alleviated the viewing experience IMO.But let that not dissuade you from watching this. Nawaz bhai is a gem and with a stellar performance from the whole cast, Raat Akeli Hai is a Mystery Lovers delight!"
"2615","Raat Akeli Hai",10,"Jai Bharat!","Great actors,exteriors,interiors,camera,depiction of India...Humor and replies""eating chow mein makes you look like an animal...look at him!""(btw I like chow mein!lol)"
"2616","Raat Akeli Hai",9,"Excellent movie","Good storyline keeps interested till the end. Good acting too"
"2617","Raat Akeli Hai",9,"Mind-blowing who done it !","Outstanding acting by Nawazuddin Siddiqui. Crisp thrilling storytelling"
"2618","Raat Akeli Hai",8,"A great watch..!!","Really good murder mystery with many twists and angles to it. Each and every character holds an important role and delivers beautifully.
Nawaz rocks again. ! One of his finest performance"
"2619","Raat Akeli Hai",8,"Mr Siddiqui himself, the best feature","There is good crime story, but what is impressive is the outstanding performance of the actor that plays the police detective character. Makes the movie worth watching"
"2620","Raat Akeli Hai",10,"Great movie. This actor always rocks. Best acticg by nawazuddin siddiqui","Great movie to watch. These type of movies actually show the drama and acting and quality of film making."
"2621","Raat Akeli Hai",8,"Well balanced and good suspense, a decent watch thriller","The pace of film might be little low, not much to grasp but the suspense and grip from everyone awesome acting made this picture so beautifully executed that one must see this. A film you can watch with family it's 18+ rated but no vulgar scene. Very well scripted. It could have been much better if the story could have more twists of short suspense in it."
"2622","Peninsula",1,"Absolute Garbage *AVOID THIS MOVIE*","Allowing this movie to air on the big screen, is an outright insult to the viewers. This is a half-assed, textbook case of milking a successful movie (Train to Busan) into a poor ""sequel"".I can write a book about the plot holes, inconsistensies and the movies being impossible for the viewers to suspend their disbelief to take it seriously.There are extended segments of painfuly edgy teen/toddler duo. Where they exchange one liners and run over infected in a ""stylish"" way. All the while they slam into other cars while drifting and grind against building/cars anime style. All the while, without sustaining as much as a scratch to the car's paint, and not even a splash of blood...Even better, nearly 1/4th of the movie is composed of these EXTREMELY poorly made CGI sections and car chases (yay?). For some reason these scenes dominate the majority of the movie.This is all so (masterfully ?) Integrated with an overwhelming amount of EXTENDED ""sad"" slow motion shots of ""dramatic"" situation about underdeveloped characters that you couldn't care less about, dying or ""almost"" dying but being saved at the last second. Rambo-style by the invincible main protagonist.This movie is utter trash, unbelievably so. I can't recall the last time where i had such an overwhelming urge, to storm out of the theater, and demand a refund.Do your a huge favour and dodge this bullet that i took for you. AVOID THIS MOVIE. Don't worry, the name aside, this movie has NOTHING to do with Train to Busan. So you are not missing out."
"2623","Peninsula",5,"Peninsula: An entertaining yet Disappointing of a Smart Sequel","When Train to Busan hit theaters, it became a sensational hit for the right reasons. It manages to become an enjoyable blockbuster yet with smart social commentary and emotional moments that (I need to admit) made me cry. 4 years later, Peninsula - the sequel - hit the theaters with high ambition but fail to reach the height of its predecessor as it falls into the ordinary sequel trap.4 years after the events of Train to Busan, a former marine, Jung-Seok (Gang Dong-won) must return and retrieve something at now-abandoned Korea in order to be accepted by the society outside their homeland. I really appreciate how they took a new approach to the zombie sequels with a new setting. However, bigger doesn't always mean better as the world-building lacked in the concept details of that never reach the tension felt in its predecessor.Perhaps the above reason can't be blame due to its small yet important component: characters. A large number of characters also resulted in less screen-time, making it hard to have in-depth sympathy with the characters. The characters also felt flat with its two-dimensional personality, making it hard for the characters to be likable even when the actors have given their best to portray them. As a result, it lacks emotional attachment and even scares to deliver.Still, I can't deny on how much entertaining Peninsula has to offer. Yeon Sang-ho's use of camerawork and how he directs the action sequence make the film watchable. I preferably like the first chase scene with zombies and the survival game. The survival game especially, really showcases his direction with his one-take. The visual style could be deemed as unique as well, showing abandoned Korea as dirty and chaotic yet beautifully eye-catching. Although I need to say that the CG in its car scene is extremely rough that you somehow looking more of a video game than a live-action film.Overall, Peninsula is could never reach its predecessor quality as a smart blockbuster with a high emotional level. However, its entertainment value, if almost, could still reach what it had left 4 years ago. Just don't expect too much to use your brain and have fun as you visit Peninsula."
"2624","Peninsula",3,"Fast and Furious: Korea Drift to Incheon","That should be the title. I am VERY surprised this was selected for Cannes. This movie still got the K-Drama vibe but lacked the thriller and shock value of the first one - even for a tiny bit. Nada. It's like they tried too hard to appeal to western viewers and ended up producing a film that the Hollywood fanatics themselves would stomp on. It was just horrible. But I expected too much because you know, 4 years from Train to Busan!I suggest that if you don't want anything to do with the first movie and want some human to human plot with zombies on the side then you can probably sit through this movie. I just lingered on hoping something interesting will happen but the whole miserable 2 hours just failed me. Really disappointed and sad that they weren't able to live up to the first movie. I hope we can all just pretend this movie never happened and wish they will make a part 3 which is more connected or has the feels of the first one. But I guess when you kill Gong Yoo in the movie then it's all downhill from there.The car racers who likes to scare themselves to sleep with thoughts of zombie outbreaks will probably love this though."
"2625","Peninsula",5,"Disappointed, feels like its a graphic action movie then a horror movie <U+0001F914>","Not thrilled at all n not scary at all.
Not touching at all as well. It's becoming similar to maze runner story a bit but worst.
Too much graphics throughout the movie.
Doesn't feel its a zombie movie anymore.
Was expecting a nice sequel from part 1 which was superb well done."
"2626","Peninsula",4,"If you want to waste your time and money...","Generally it is a movie about driving skill instead of zombies."
"2627","Peninsula",6,"Disappointing.","As much as I love the first movie, I expected more from this sequel but I have to admit that it was a bit boring in my opinion. there's not much action like the first one where they were being chased by the zombies. as this movie takes place 4 years after the first one, it is more about human vs human, just like how it is when u watch the walking dead. they moved on from fighting zombies."
"2628","Peninsula",1,"Horrible plot and disqualified movie","It's totally different from train to busan. The worst part is the plot which looks like anyhow write up. No firm structure. Feels like watching a racing or shooting scenes movie instead of zombie vs humans. It seems totally unrelated to the structure of train to busan and this movie just try to get people's attention under the name of so called ""train to busan"" film. Not worth to waste the time watching it."
"2629","Peninsula",2,"Tried too hard to copy Hollywood","The reason first movie worked was because it had a heart. It's almost cruel how much the film tugged at your heartstrings.Train to Busan wastes no time getting to the point, the build up only takes a few brief scenes, then the madness captivates the rest. We see the outbreak from beginning, middle and end within the narrative's run time. You have time to develop empathy for each character, their backstories, and connections to one another fleshed out in small bursts throughout the film. While the human condition is in question, the narrative also explores societal themes, which are all perfectly juxtaposed with gory yet skillfully crafted action sequences.This movie on the other hand may as well be directed by Michael Bay with pointless action and explosions. It tries too hard to be like Hollywood action movies and it shows. I will pretend this movie never happened."
"2630","Peninsula",1,"this plot/story was written by a zombie(s)","A child-like TV movie - think Dukes of Hazard - meets a poor Mad Max. the action is not paced and it's all very predictable/unbelievable. only watch if you are under 21."
"2631","Peninsula",6,"Everything at once","Peninsula is an extremely fun movie to watch. It packs virtually all genres possible, the movie is way too much but very entertaining. You have zombies (although they are not really threatening and felt more like a tool used to advance the plot), you have Mad Max-like car chases, you have wild insane people enjoying the Purge, you have a hint of a comedy and a whole lot of soap opera drama. At one point I was convinced the characters would start dancing Bollywood-style!
While Train to Busan was character-driven and emotional film, Peninsula is a wild, action-packed movie which has almost nothing to do with the former. It would fit perfectly into Zombieland universe and the reviews here would be much better then. In other words, it is a bad movie if you expect Train to Busan continuation but a good Zombieland 3.
Plot-wise, Peninsula leaves even more question unanswered, if you think about characters' background or some story details you'll notice a lot of inconsistencies, plot holes and unclarities. But this movie is not made to think, so don't take it seriously, don't expect much and just enjoy whatever nonsense is going on on-screen."
"2632","Peninsula",5,"Worst sequel","Easy plot. Lazy storyline, more action than zombie. Final act this movie like watching fast and furious movie."
"2633","Peninsula",2,"Boring!!","It is very slow and boring! Pace is very disrupted and it makes audience cannot connect with even one of the main characters, u won't be crying for sure !!"
"2634","Peninsula",2,"Stupidest slow motion ive ever seen","It was okey from the start till the end, but the last part!! its just unbelievable stupid!!the slow motion, i just had to do a face palm, from that scene..aigooo!for the writer and director who wrote and direct this, you should have done better, im always been a fan of kdrama since early 2000 but this one is far from my favorite, far from the train to busan with gong yo.. Anyways enjoy"
"2635","Peninsula",5,"very very annoying movie.","Another typical zombie apocalypse cliche movie where the bad guys are annoyingly screaming constantly for no reason. the only relation to train of busan is korean zombies. also, please hire actors that can actually speak proper cantonese/mandarin in movies."
"2636","Peninsula",8,"Entertaining Movie","I think it's very entertaining. I found the storyline so intriguing."
"2637","Peninsula",4,"Puts the original to shame","REVIEW - Peninsula (Train to Busan 2)Back in 2016 one of the best ever Zombie films was released, made in Korea this film took the world by storm and literally got full scores everywhere, I reviewed it here and now 4 years later the sequel has finally been released.Peninsula is set 4 years after the original and the Zombie outbreak has been confirmed to the Busan area of Korea which has been sealed off from the rest of the world.A group of desperate people are hired to go in and recover a truck full of money which was stolen from various banks inside the effected area.As expected things don't go to plan and.......But there are survivors and of course the groups cross paths all trying to use the truck full of money as an excuse to leave.I had very high expectations for this film because of the first and I'm going to put this out there now, NO!This film is nothing compared to the original, the original was in your face jaw droppingly excellent but this sequel is just a silly premise, silly execution with silly tugging at your heart strings which for a Zombie film shouldn't be there.The first film had characters but the Zombies were the main attraction, in this film you meet a few characters but honestly you don't care less if they live or survive.What a wasted opportunity and this sequel let's down the original, in fact this sequel shouldn't even be associated with the original!Some watchible parts but just stick to the original Train to Busan.Rating 4 out of 10"
"2638","Peninsula",6,"Very disappointed","As much as I love the first movie, I expected more from this sequel but I have to admit that it was a bit boring in my opinion. there's not much action like the first one where they were being chased by the zombies."
"2639","Peninsula",1,"Awful, embarrassed for the film makers {because they don't appear to be!}","What junk. Awful. Bad script. Bad and completely implausible and illogical plot. Bad CGI. Some truly awful acting. Saccharine sweet and way, way, way over the top ""acting"" with scenes designed to illicit emotion that are laugh inducing. I used my face mask during the last ten minutes to cover my eyes most of the time in horror of what I had to witness in the name of a film making money grab. If you love over the top Asian love story soap opera drama you'll love this movie. I've seen better CGI on a Playstation. In fact much of this movie looks like a Playstation game being played while you are forced to endure it."
"2640","Peninsula",2,"Not as expected. Sexquel one is much better.","Too many illogical plot settings and exagerated dramas. Typical Korean drama<U+0001F61E>"
"2641","Peninsula",5,"Didn't live up to the first movie","The movie lack the atmosphere and tension for the majority of the film which made the first film enjoyable, however it managed to capture small portions of it near the end of the film. It definitely took a Hollywood type direction added with some poor video game type cgi."
"2642","Peninsula",3,"I am baffled...","How can this piece of crap be by the same director that gave us Train to Busan, which is a genre masterpiece?In the first move I really cared for the characters. It was both exiting, inventive and touching. Peninsula is anything but.The whole post apocalyptic society is so kliché ridden it is embarrasing. The action scenes are ruined by crappy CGI, and the antagonists (with bad teeth) are so annoying and over the top - in that crazy, Mad Max kind of way - that they almost single handedly ruin the entire movie. As for the protagonists (with beautiful, white teeth), they manage to make them likeable, but just not enough, which makes the movies touching moments fall completely flat, and the action scenes feel utterly boring. You just don't care about them at all. All the sobbing is just cringeworthy.A waste of time. A big dissapointment."
"2643","Peninsula",7,"More action than the first one!","Everyone expect the same amount of emotion and social commentary like the first one. But its not, Its focus more on action. Too bad the CGI is not that good, if they can manage that department really well, this movie will be more awesome. A lot of people saying it lacks emotion, that's why I say ""not same amount"". There is family theme in this one too who care for each other, but its just really cliche. By the way, its really fun to watch and really different from any cliche american zombie. Give this Korean a chance!"
"2644","Peninsula",3,"Fast and furious 10","Train to Busan name not match. It should be named fast and furious 10
Not even a single train scene in whole movie.Zombie just for an entertaining
Real story based on car racing fight and some illogical story.
2star for car racing
1 star for VFX
That's all"
"2645","Peninsula",8,"Movie was good but those comparing with first will never been satisfied","I liked this movie,was good & entertaining but those people not liked this movie reason comparing this movie with first part( first part was masterpiece,Authentic,Fresh story,korean style touch,potray human emotions in depth ) but this movie seems liked watch hollywood typical action movie,i hoped this movie story will be unique with authentic korean touch ,its was better if director follow korean orignality rather then hollywood style"
"2646","Peninsula",6,"Above average!","I expected more than this when i heard that the movie was taken to the Cannes film festival."
"2647","Peninsula",8,"I Don't Think It Was A Garbage Or Worst Seque!!!!!! It Was A Good Movie <U+2764>","It Was A Excellent Movie. I Like It. I Don't Know Why People Are Saying It Was Bad. As A Korean Movie With 16 Million USD Budget It Was A Perfect Movie. Enjoy A Lot <U+0001F618>. I Hope We Will See Train To Busan 3."
"2648","Peninsula",4,"peninsula","Peninsula is a sequel to a big korean smash hit film train to busan from 2016,and here we are following events that are happening for years after already mentioned events,so as you may have predicted at least i did,this movie isnt even close to be as good as the first film,it doesnt actually feel like it is part of same universe except few scenes with zombies we got nothing more that would give us some important or at least enterteining staff,in some scenes i felt like i was watching some commercial for cars expecely in beginning of film,cause ther where a lot of times when camera was zooming around car like director wanted of us that we buy it immidietly,also towards ending film looks like its part of fast and furious franchises and by that time more and more staff is falling apart,Peninsula was a huge waste and dissapoinment compared to great first film ,only good staff were acting and little staff with zombies,everything else felt like a lazy cash grab"
"2649","Peninsula",4,"Nothing special","The storyline is too easy to guess, most of the car chasing scene feels like a video game. Overall disappointed"
"2650","Peninsula",10,"Loved every minute","Short and sweet review, TTB had an insane claustrophobic feel which was never going to be repeated unless they did airplane to busan lolThis film tries to expand the universe and is fully enjoyable once you get past the annoying kids (which every horror has to have for some reason).
People tend to hate the focus shifting from zombies to humans (ref- TWD) but I think its shown well in this film, after all what do you expect when madmen rule with no consequences.
Absolutely top notch film, some edge of your seat nail biting moments but think world war Z mixed with fast and furious."
"2651","Peninsula",8,"Its action movie","Like mad max with zombie.
It starts same timeline of movie train to busan.
But movie style show like car action movie as like Mad max with Zomebie.
It is just for Killingtime for weekend freetime.
Many zombies but no scared.
Even tooo many zombies.
No Suspens.
Well, most of Zombie movie fan will disapoint."
"2652","Peninsula",3,"Boring and not worth it","Actually i dont really have any expextation from this movie,but when i watch it, it feel so boring, drama and thriller from this movie sorry to say i can't fell it..i am watching some movie or drama serial about zombie before, sorry to say peninsula can't beat them..For me better watch other zombie things"
"2653","Peninsula",5,"Enjoyable","Not as good as Train to Busan but it is still enjoyable to watch during free time. Too much action and too less story. The CGI also not that good."
"2654","Peninsula",4,"4/10","I think first one was much better than this... ""Not bad but disappointed."""
"2655","Peninsula",9,"A beautiful genre film","""Peninsula"" is the spiritual sequel to 2016 smash hit ""Train to Busan"", and it's a surprising official selection for 2020 Cannes Film Festival.The film is an entertaining vehicle that never stops. I was at the edge of my seat from the beginning till the end. It's a beautiful genre film.
There're car chases, gunfire, explosions, and hand-to-hand combats. The cinematography and sound design are very well crafted.It's thrilling and exciting, making me think of some greatest action films in history, ""True Lies"", ""Die Hard"", and ""Mad Max: Fury Road"" especially.Just when you think 2019 ""Parasite"" is the highest achievement of Korean cinema, ""Peninsula"" pushes the boundary further."
"2656","Peninsula",7,"Those who are looking to board on a TRAIN - Let me tell you clearly this time it's a CAR","Peninsula doesn't reach the visceral heights of its predecessor but it's never dull. It hits the marks where it's supposed to, except in the final stretch where the human drama gets in the way of a satisfying wrap-up. I won't go into details about the scene; it's just that the exasperating scene goes on and on and it'll make you scream... but for all the wrong reasons.
PS : Last 30mins heavily reminded me of the mad max fury in a gaming mode."
"2657","Peninsula",8,"Oh boy here we go again","Peninsula (2020) the highly anticipated sequel to the surprise smash hit zombie flick Train to Busan (2016) from South Korea just drop this week in my country and as a fan of the genre and the movie I find my self in a very weird love-hate relationship with this movie. From the trailer, I can already tell that this movie gonna be more bombastic with explosion and action than the last one yet I never thought that it gonna be this underwhelming. If you looking for an entertaining zombie movie then this movie is no doubt the best option right now when it features many well-shot action scenes with the best car chase scene I've ever seen in quite a long time but on the other hand, the human drama aspect that makes many people fall in love with the franchise in the first place was pretty weak. The main cast still likable for you to root for them but because the movie doesn't spend enough time to develop them as much as they can all the dramatic moments that meant to draw the audience's tears fall extremely flat. I dare to say that if the movie keeps the premise of the opening sequence and a more grounded cast then maybe.....just maybe Peninsula can bring back the magic touch from the last one but rn lower your expectation is the best advice I can give"
"2658","Peninsula",9,"Forget the First Movie and Watch It.","Why on earth would I tell you to forget the first movie to watch a sequel?
Because it's irrelevant... just like the pre-sequel (that not many know about.)It truly is, this movie will have nothing to do with any of the original cast members and you will not find out what happens to the young girl (Su-an) after they get to Busan. At best you can assume they were shipped out among the refugees.In the beginning of this movie they cover what happens in the first and give you the setting of the world so you will not be required to watch the first one to understand the second. With that in mind if you don't think about the first movie or expect the same aspects then all and all it was a very exciting and well done action movie.
It has its flaws:The car scenes- A lot of reviews had an issue with the car scenes and I can understand that it felt like an apocalyptic fast n furious. That bothered me as well but I get what they were trying to do there. Because with those kinds of zombies you would need some sort of means for transportation and you would have to be very skilled about it, it's not like the train system would be running anymore for your convenience. Still I would have liked the graphics to have been toned down a bit but it wasn't like they were going to have zombie fighting scenes in their cars like the on the train so they were trying to bring excitement to the movie where they would be obviously lacking.The timeline- I didn't see many people mentioning this complaint so I'll point it out. The concept of being four years later is highly unlikely not when the zombies themselves had a major design flaw at night. The entire world wouldn't rest at ease with an entire country infested with zombies, blocked off or not. There would have been drones dropping bombs or some means of dropping the infected in numbers. I could have easily been convinced with a year difference, having those with connections trying to get their money out before the government executes it's plan. But four years without the entire world being infected and absolutely nothing being done about the zombies, it's just too large of a gap.The lack in zombie action- Here's the thing I like a good zombie movie with zombie's being the main issue like anybody else. However, the fighting between the zombies being little to none is not unreasonable. If you were hoping for the action of the first movie it's just not going to happen. We're talking four years later, at this point if you are still alive you know how to stay alive. The zombie threat isn't as present as the threat of those who also know how to stay alive because they are either thieves or trying to seize power in a lawless land. (As pointed out in the walking dead multiple times)The lack of day light scenes- Again this refers back to my comment, that after four years, you know it is only safe at night. Still, I like zombie movies that can be brought in the daylight hours. I love when a horror movie can still make an impact even without cover of darkness. Setting it four years later with hide outs and safe places to stay in the daylight hours it just couldn't be accomplished in this movie and that was disappointing.^That's just a few of my main issues with the movie but that doesn't stop me from easily adding this movie in the top list of my favored zombie movies. I like how Korean films betray zombies like these rabid animals instead of walking corpses. If they make another I would love to see it as well.Also if you haven't watched Seoul Station, it's an animated movie that I would suggest you watch at your own discretion. The characters in the movie are not very pleasant and it's hard to attach to any of them. There are no heart warming moments and no touching sacrifices made (Something which at least the second movie did try to accomplish.)
It's nothing like the Train to Busan and honestly I think that watching Seoul Station before this movie, gave me a better understanding that these movies are only sharing the same zombie apocalypse, nothing more."
"2659","Peninsula",NA,"Hoping it's good?","The first one is my favourite movie if all time so I can only hope this one will live up to its hype. Seeing the negative reviews has me nerbous, but we'll see!"
"2660","Peninsula",10,"Worth It","Watched it just now. And it's worth my money and time, love it!
So scaring and touching <3RECOMMENDED"
"2661","Peninsula",6,"Interesting nd intriguing in Parts","Its not a zombie movie. Its more like Human vs human. I expected a lot but Not good as it's predecessor. Action sequences are too good when compared to Previous one. But it lacks conviction. Climax is too good when compared to rest of the movie. And it's more like mixed bag of Maze runner and Fast and furious. Locations are Okay. Sound editing and Mixing are not upto the mark. Watch it for action episodes"
"2662","Peninsula",3,"Don't waste your time","I expected this movie at a high level since Train to Busan 1 impressed me pretty much. But this movie was disappointing. The first part was very slow and boring with unnecessary drama and the second part was way from realistic story. The people in the movie made decision very slow and they were not human instinct. I heard a few people snored in the cinema. Finally, I would say it's not Train to Busan at all. Don't waste your time."
"2663","Peninsula",8,"Peninsula","It wasn't as expectable as train to busan(2016)...I hoped something more..But I liked the movie...Generally it's because I love korean movie"
"2664","Peninsula",4,"Disappointed","Nothing like Train to busan
Should change the name to (Train to busan : Fast and furious)
So many bug

"2665","Peninsula",5,"Anti climax","I so disappointed,did they not learn why the walking dead lost views, the first Movie was way better, from zombie movie to serial killer movie."
"2666","Peninsula",10,"AMAZING MOVIE, MUST WATCH","I think people have to understand that even though this is the sequel to the original movie it is not continuing off of exactly where the last movie left off, this is completely someone else's story and years after the first one. If you are into action this movie definitely will have you on edge although the English voice acting sucked, It still left me with the same feelings as the first one. A masterpiece. I was satisfied with it. This film also shows how money can lead people to do the worst and be completely selfish even in a time where everyone should be looking out for each other. Dont let others selfish or overly critical reviews set you off from watching it. Keep a low expectation remembering it's not going to be like the first movie. MUST WATCH"
"2667","Peninsula",1,"Terrible!!","This movie did not make any sense at all. So many mistakes the and poor acting and did not have no connection with the first movie. I was also upset because how are you going to have a white man being the leader of an Asian gang in an Asian country. The whole movie from beginning to end was craps."
"2668","Peninsula",7,"Intriguing approach as to Zombies during the pandemic","1.
I visited the theater with no expectations but with merely a curiosity. However, I came back surprised by the even better perfection and the message that I had expected. If anyone plans to go out to the theater after being long-term stayed in the house due to pandemic, I would like to recommend it with confidence. I think it will be the first 5 million, or seven million-viewer Korean movies this year. The reason that I feel seems that the theme of this is quite in line with the situation of the corona pandemic.
Basically, I had little interest in, and no affection for Soup-opera drama, which we Korean have called it ""Shinppa: appealing for the excessive emotion) movie,"" which means overly focused on sad emotion for popularity. After the Corona crisis epidemic, I am once again thinking about the fundamental reasons and causes of this kind of Film. The distinct but essential setting of zombie movies usually focuses on the main character's choice when his/her loved ones, family friends, and relatives turn into zombies or are on the verge of change. If they're all dead, the movie becomes apocalypse movie, and if they're in the early stages, the movie's main atmosphere would be horror. As we already know, all zombie movies have already used up every setting that can come out. What are they going to do now?
2.
Director Yeon Sang-ho, however, comes up with this ""Shinppa"" in a genius-like manner. The theme of his previous movie ""Road to Busan"" was also used this 'excessive Emotion"" in his primary way to deal with zombies. It seems to be shouting to the viewers like this. ""Don't give up and bring your family back from hell!"" ""If your lover and your family member die, you're also already dead."" The foundation of the ""Shinppa"" is family love. It should be distinguished from family-oriented selfishness and nepotism. What is the power that supports society? Is it a reason or emotion? Isn't it based on love that goes beyond reason to save someone in danger?
It is not a crucial factor to make people cry or not while watching the movie. But the movie seems to convey the message that the reason we live is neither money and honor but to protect and embrace people who live close to us. If we are the person always think and decide logically when we are plunged into the situation of survival games, the way to survive would be not so difficult and complicated. Just sacrificing your colleges quickly. And cutting off the limbs one by one is the best choice no matter what. We've seen enough of the situation through the pandemics of Covid-19. Why do we live? How to cope with it. Director Yeon has made a fascinating zombie movie. It will be a worldwide hit.
Peninsula, I strongly recommend the movie.
(However, if you're a little bit generous with low-budget quality and emotional movie)"

"2670","Peninsula",10,"Mad Max & Maze Runner","Train to Busan has that heavy emotion tagged to its name, this Peninsula is just complete trash. The first half was like slow paced no character development all, everything feels safe and the villains didn't have enough space to develop their vileness and the second half Is like a try hard breed of Mad Max and Maze Runner.Stick to your Korean screen writing style that brought you such recognition and stop trying to be Hollywood.

"2672","Peninsula",6,"Fast and furious, but not","I must first say, I watched the first movie, Train to Busan. Absolutely loved that, the story was action packed but still manages to put many heart warming scene.Moving on to Peninsula, it used it's same successful formula to create another fantastic movie with an equally amazing plot. However, this movie does have some points I do not like. For one, this movie puts too much focus on car chase scenes. Yes, car chase is cool and all but for a zombie movie, it just seems a little much. Moreover, with the many characters introduced in the movie, I feel that it leaves some of the characters underdeveloped and I did not feel anything when any characters died, more like an Okay noted let's move on kind of feeling. I do however, like that they are able add details in the movie that help in the plot later in the movie.Overall, I'd say, this is yet another interesting film to watch which I enjoyed. However, there were points that I wished can be improved on and that this film would focus more on the emotional aspects of the film that really brought part 1, Train to Busan to an entirely fresh and mind blowing level."
"2673","Le Mans '66",10,"Puts my faith in the movie business again","This is what cinema is supposed to be! Amazing chemistry and acting by both leads, seamless CGI and practical effects to enhance the film, a firecracker script, a true story, pulse pounding soundtrack, booming sound mix, and edited so well that 2.5 hours flies by! Completely and utterly engaging . So good in fact I saw it twice within 24 hours . Once in Imax and once in Dolby cinema ."
"2674","Le Mans '66",8,"""I had no idea. If only my dad were alive to see this.""","I've seen a lot of car movies, as a self-professed car nut. As such I judge them harshly, and immediately dismiss entries that don't provide enough reason to care about what is more important than the car: the driver. Think of the Fast and Furious and Transformers franchise. If you care about the driver, and the driver cares about the car, you care about the car. The car is a tool, an extension of the hero's body, and gains provenance with the audience when it helps the hero on their personal journey. Movies that come to mind that do this effectively include Gone in 60 Seconds, Bullitt, Need For Speed, The Italian Job, Batman Begins, and The Bourne Identity. Some of the James Bond movies do it well, like Goldfinger, The Spy Who Loves Me, The Living Daylights, and SkyFall, but many do not because of the lack of character arc in the story. We cannot forget about perhaps the greatest car movie of all time, Back to the Future. The shining example of how to make the car a proper star.And now enters a film by James Mangold and starring talented actors Matt Damon and Christian Bale called Ford v. Ferrari. My arms crossed, and expectations lowered, I was ready to be disappointed. Although I love Mangold as a director, somehow I assumed there would be a Michael Bay approach to the movie, putting more emphasis on car action sequences than the characters. To my surprise, not only was I dead wrong, but the film became one of the best car movies I had ever seen.Thinking back, I should have known better. Unlike many car action oriented movies, this one is based on a true story, and fact-based dramas tend to take themselves more seriously. It is sort of a shared biopic between legendary sports car designer Carroll Shelby and race car driver Ken Miles. The movie focuses on their efforts to beat Ferrari at Le Mans, a story I'm well aware of (like I said, bonafide car nut). And Mangold is an Oscar winning filmmaker collaborating with Oscar winning people such as Damon and Bale.And boy do their talents shine in this movie. The driving engine of the story, if you will, is the loving but at times clashing relationship between Shelby and Miles, portrayed brilliantly by Damon and Bale in a manner that in my opinion is more entertaining and engaging than the dynamic duo of DiCaprio and Pitt in Once Upon A Time ... in Hollywood. Damon and Bale have different styles of acting, but both arrive at the same place: creating a character that faces disappointment in the search for victory.Shelby has to come to terms with the disappointment of having to quit his racing career due to heart problems, and creating a winning team at Le Mans is his way of proving to himself he's still a winner. Miles is desperate not to disappoint himself because unlike Shelby, he's never had a shot at winning at a big race. This is due to his abrasive personality, despite an amazing talent on the race track. On top of this, Miles desperately doesn't want to disappoint his wife and son, who support him fervently in his dream. Both characters have their own obstacles in search of escaping disappointment, with Shelby dealing with the suits at Ford and Miles dealing with problems of the car in the race as they present themselves, and the trial of besting the other race car drivers. Their individual struggles intersect in the mutual desire to win at Le Mans, resulting in a brotherhood and mutual love for each other that feels genuine and earned.Henry Ford II, played by a very effective Tracy Letts, reveals in a quick but moving scene why he wants to win at Le Mans. After Shelby takes Ford on a whirlwind nauseating ride with the new race car they have engineered, Ford breaks into tears. Not so much because of the physically jarring experience of being jostled around at breakneck speed, but because of what the car means to his family name. ""I had no idea. If only my dad were alive to see this,"" he tells Shelby. Damon, in that scene, responds with wet eyes. The character Ford reveals how much he doesn't want to disappoint his family legacy. In fact, the entire endeavor started with an insult from Ferrari, stating, ""You're only Henry Ford the second, you'll never be Henry Ford."" And in an earlier scene, Ford compares himself to his legendary grandfather in a speech to Ford factory workers concerning his disappointment in current company sales.Cars represent man's desire to chase a dream. Whether it be designing the fastest car, or driving cars the fastest. And despite all the obstacles that may get in man's way, the biggest one is always himself. But with perseverance and the help of others, this obstacle can too be overcome. Ford v. Ferrari manages to get to the heart of this message with deceptive ease and supreme confidence. The film's absolutely gorgeous cinematography and direction capture some of the most amazing car sequences ever put to the big screen. A surprising but believable behind the scenes factoid is that Mangold and the cast are not car nuts at all, and were simply moved to tell the story of the characters. This is why the movie works so well, because they understood the car as supporting the story rather than the other way around.Ford v. Ferrari is an absolute winner, with memorable performances from its cast, and my favorite Mangold picture thus far. For me, it is one of the best of the year, and as far as car movies go, one of the best ever made, and miles away from a disappointment."
"2675","Le Mans '66",10,"Fantastic","Just saw F v F at the Telluride Film Festival and it is phenomenal. Perfect performances, incredible visuals and editing, immersive sound, and a riveting story. A real winner. Christian Bale lost 70 pounds Defoe the role and is a delight. Damon is spot on. Catriona Balfe is excellent. All the actors playing Ford executives are excellent as well. Masterful direction from James Mangold. A must see."
"2676","Le Mans '66",8,"I know nothing of cars or racing, nor do I care about either yet....","To start off, I have always hated racing. Yes, hated. It think it's a ridiculous waste of resources, and boring to watch. I have zero interest in cars - and thus I know absolutely nothing of the history. I knew nothing of this film beyond reading the blurb before I started watching it, so I was very interested to see whether I would like it at all. I did. Despite being so uninterested in the subject, the film got me interested in the story, and especially during the final race I was on the edge of seat not knowing what would happen. Fantastic acting job from both Damon and Bale, usual. They never disappoint. Excellent writing, directing, cutting, sound editing.. A very whole package overall.To finish off; I am STILL not interested in cars or racing, but this film stands on its own even so."
"2677","Le Mans '66",9,"Movie keeps you at 7000 rpm","Ford V Ferrari is one of the best movies I've seen this year, and for someone who has little interest in cars besides minivans and SUVs, that's saying a lot. Just like the race cars produced by its namesakes, Ford v. Ferrari is sleek and fast; a powerful and expensive machine. A supremely well-balanced combination of corporate rivalry, on-track competitiveness and human drama."
"2678","Le Mans '66",9,"An exhilarating and emotional ride","A lot of notes were hit by Ford v Ferrari. The characters are fleshed out very well and give you the emotional attachment you're looking for in a movie. Bale and Damon's performances are great; they pull you into the story and completely disappear into their roles. James Mangold proves, once again, to be a master behind the camera. The action scenes are shot to perfection and will have you biting your nails.The film's technical aspects were top-notch as well. Wait for this film to be nominated for sound design and editing. These technical aspects, during the climax of the film, will blow your hair back and give you goosebumps.All in all, this film provides a pleasing experience for the crowd that not many films can even come close to delivering. I loved about every second of it, despite its long runtime."
"2679","Le Mans '66",9,"Filled with Energy","Biopics can be a hard sell at times. Whether you're diving into the troubled life of an addict or exploring someone's sexuality, there are many touchy subjects these days. With that said, I feel there are also those that will stand the test of time, in terms of being able to please a wide audience. Ford v Ferrari is one of the latest true stories out of Hollywood that will be hitting the big screen soon, and here's why I believe it absolutely deserves attention.Following multiple characters throughout, Ford v Ferrari focussed on the fact that Henry Ford II was given an idea to create the fastest race car in the world. His mission is to take down the likes of the company Ferrari, who have held the title for years. Carol Shelby (Matt Damon) is approached by a member of the Ford team and is recruited, only to be the one finding himself recruiting the driver in Ken Miles (Christian Bale). That's the core premise and there's a lot to dive into from there.If you're a fan of racing or cars in general, this movie will be for you. This is a very well-directed film by James Mangold, and the racing sequences are quite long, taking up a good chunk of the nearly 150-minute run time. Luckily, they are very intense, practically shot, with a fantastic score to back it up, and sound effects to get your heart pumping. Everything about the exciting aspects of this film was top notch.Christian Bale and Matt Damon give stellar performances here as the two leading men in the film and I totally bought their rigid friendship that slowly developed. Sadly, without giving anything away, there is an incident that I feel was not explored enough, which slightly took away when a certain moment is meant to impact the movie. Other than that, this is a fantastic movie from beginning to end.In the end, Ford v Ferrari is engaging, emotional, and downright thrilling when it wants to be. I was invested in these characters and on the edge of my seat during the climactic races. I thoroughly enjoyed my experience with this movie. There is a missed opportunity in terms of emotion during a certain scene, but I was able to forgive that, seeing as the rest of the movie was so impressive. Ford v Ferrari is one of the best movies I've seen so far this year and it will be one to see when it officially releases."

Everything that needs to be said has already been said about the two leading stars in the movie but big shout out to the supporting cast including Jon Bernthal who was great.The story is good but it's a biographical drama so not much can be changed even though there were few liberties were taken with few facts that were presented.The sound design was excellent which made your heart race faster when you heard the roar of the Ford GT 40!Cinematography by Phedon (who was also the cinematographer for the pursuit of happiness) gives us some nice shots of the race which immerses you into action.I got to watch it as part of secret preview show!

I struggled with Bale's UK Northern accent occasionally, but a story of risk, achievement and friendship, with some great driving scenes. Would recommended, especially for any race fans.
8/10"
"2690","Le Mans '66",10,"One of the best movies I've ever seen in long time","I like the movie a lot, one of the best in so much a long time, the two lead actors nailed their roles and the story line is so good, effects and CGI are both great and the movie pretty much tells a story of faith and hard work on top of talent."
"2691","Le Mans '66",10,"Made me want to tear out of the parking lot at 7000 rpm.","One of the best movies I've seen this year. A reminder that not all modern movies suck."
"2692","Le Mans '66",9,"As good as ""Rush"" but in a different way...","Yes indeed, I say it; as good as ""Rush"" (the rivalry between Hunt and Lauda). This movie focuses on the rivalry between Ford and Ferrari. And focuses even more on the deal between Carroll Shelby and Mr. H. Ford II. And the driver/mechanic of one of the cars during Le Mans in 1966: Ken Miles.Christian (Bale) and Matt (Damon) are portraying there characters really well. I didn't know that Bale was British, now I know. But either way, every character in the film is believable. The story - based upon real life, so not completely accurate - is entertaining and comes close to the real deal.If you are looking for the real story of the race (and the events towards that) this ain't the movie for you, because it's a movie and not a documentary. And the movie needs to entertain the crowd that is coming towards this piece. So who should watch it ? Autosport fans for sure, Endurance fans absolutely (like myself), car enthusiasts perhaps - depending on which car-class(es).The way they set the whole vibe (I was instantly back at my first trip to Le Mans (2012)). The way they show you the track and the rivalry, and the cars. It's really an awesome movie. Just like Rush. Yes Rush was more about the race, but had also a story but a bit thinner then this one. The story isn't a big one in this one, but it's there. And if you expect a Rush look-a-like you will be sad, so expect more story !I will definitely get this on DVD."
"2693","Le Mans '66",9,"Christian bale + Matt Damon + Story = Perfection","Frankly speaking, whoever reading this review right now, please stop reading any more reviews wasting your time. Trust me, undoubtedly this movie belongs to the ""Best of 2019"". So what are you waiting for? I bet you won't regret after watching it.Happy watching!!! <U+0001F642>"
"2694","Le Mans '66",10,"Brilliant.","Review:
'Ford v Ferrari' is a sports-drama film directed by James Mangold.
What a film this is! I really wish I had waited to do my top ten list of 2019 until I seen this movie. My eyes were glued to the screen the whole time I was watching it.
The plot follows a determined team of American engineers and designers, led by automotive visionary Carroll Shelby (Matt Damon) and his British driver, Ken Miles (Christian Bale), who are dispatched by Henry Ford II (Tracy Letts) and Lee Iacocca (Jon Bernthal) with the mission of building the Ford GT40, a new racing car with the potential to finally defeat the perennially dominant Ferrari racing team at the 1966 24 Hours of Le Mans race in France.
Christian Bale and Matt Damon give stellar performances here as the two leading men in the film and I totally bought their rigid friendship that slowly developed. Jon Bernthal shows that he is more than an action guy when it comes to his acting capabilities, and Josh Lucas might just be the evillest villain to come out of 2019, including Thanos himself. What a dick he is in this movie and he plays it to perfection.
James Mangold proves, once again, to be a master behind the camera. The action scenes are shot to perfection and will have you biting your nails. The race scenes have the tension they need, and Matt Damon and Christian Bale bring the humor without over doing it.
Overall, this is entertainment at its finest. There are some true story films that don't relate well to the big screen, this one will excel expectations. Great direction with a phenomenal cast is an A+.
5/5"
"2695","Le Mans '66",9,"Very Re-watchable","It's not an ""important"" movie, but it's very entertaining and very re-watchable. Matt Damon and Christian Bale give solid performances as usual, as does the rest of the cast. Good direction and I loved the use of the song Polk Salad Annie. I had a minor problem with some aspects of the ending, but nothing worth bringing up."
"2696","Le Mans '66",10,"I feel it in every detail","Absolutely wonderful, ""speedy"" and heart touching movie.
I feel a race in every detail: from beautiful shots to the amazing sound of cars and the rest.
My palms are sweating on the turns.
Good acting, good characters and good story.
Yeah. I feel it. I feel this in every turn."
"2697","Le Mans '66",9,"It got better and better!","The first half an hour I was thinking how long is this movie. Then I looked back down and an hour and half had passed and was ready for more. You get so involved into the movie the real world melts away. This hasn't happened in a long time. You will be entertained!"
"2698","Le Mans '66",10,"Wonderful Storytelling","Enjoyed everything about this movie. Christian Bale's performance was thoroughly entertaining. Matt Damon was solid along with the rest of the cast. A must see, surprisingly a lot of character development and heart."
"2699","Le Mans '66",10,"A big Hollywood Film that delivers !","Once in a while, a big Hollywood film is made with big Hollywood stars, and big Hollywood production values and occasionally everything works to deliver a dynamic cinematic event.
Such is the case with director James Mangold's new film ""Ford v Ferrari"". Armed with superior talent in front and behind the camera, Mr. Mangold has directed his best film yet with bravado. A strong screenplay is the foundation of a great story involving the characters portrayed by Matt Damon playing American Car Designer Carroll Shelby, driver Christian Bale, and Tracy Letts as Henry Ford II, all involved in challenging the famous Italian car maker Ferrari at the famous race at Le Mans in 1966.
From the very first frame, James Mangold sets the tone with exciting, bold and energetic images that are visually arresting, alongside a great score that never overwhelms or feels generic. The editing is outstanding, as the pace is so fast moving, pulsating with nail biting excitement, especially in the racing sequences.
Cinematographer Phedon Papamichael, along with Production Designer Francois Audouy, and Costume Designer Daniel Orlandi, have created a rich canvas, always authentic in feel, full of subtleties resulting in a formidable palette that comes together beautifully.
Flawless performances are a high point under the guidance of James Mangold's direction. Matt Damon has rarely had the opportunity to show quite a range from confidant showman to a vulnerability we rarely see. Christian Bale as always disappears into his character and delivers another stellar performance, and Tracy Letts layers his performance with strength and flair.
Ultimately, James Mangold's master work delivers on all fronts, and on the whole one of the most satisfying films of the year, and certain to be a major contender for many well deserved awards !"
"2700","Le Mans '66",5,"Bale is great but the movie is tedious","I read a review of this film in the New Yorker that said the title was unfortunate because it would make people think it was a sports film when it was more than that. The reviewer was wrong. This is a sports movie, with all the sports movie tropes, and it's all been done better.The film follows car designers Carrol Shelby and race car driver Ken Miles as they work to help Ford create a car that can beat Ferrari's in a big race. This in itself is odd, in that the movie wants you to see the guys working for a corporate behemoth as scrappy underdogs, which is a bit of a stretch.This is very much a boy movie, by which I mean it's entirely focused on testosterone-fueled competition ranging from international pissing contests to corporate competition to fist fights on the lawn. You could easily call this movie ""Mine is Bigger."" And much of my problem with the movie was I didn't care whose was bigger.The best thing in the movie is Bale as Miles. Instead of the typical cocky race driver of other films, Miles comes across as grease-monkey engineer who not only engineers the car but also plans and engineers his entire race. It's a smart, amiable performance that should be in a better movie.I am perplexed that this movie was nominated for an Oscar against genuinely significant movies like Parasite and Jojo Rabbit. The best I can say of it is that it is less undeserving of the nomination than Joker. I'm also puzzled by all the gushing reviews.There are some good moments, particularly in the racing scenes, but the film is hugely overlong and everything past the end of the race feels like a needless and maudlin dragging out of something that should have been a zippy 90-minute film.Not recommended."
"2701","Le Mans '66",5,"Cheesy with many holes in the story","Knowing the full history of the event, this movie is more about American pride and heroism than cars. As an huge racing fan and a Formula 1 fan whom enjoyed the original Grand Prix and Rush, this movie does not hit the spot, rather childish."
"2702","Le Mans '66",6,"A Cheeseburger with extra cheese.","It is entertaining, its a crowd pleaser, Christian Bale (as always) inhabits the role and Matt Damon is Matt Damon. But this is made to appeal to the widest range of viewers and as such dumbs just about everything down. Its soooo predictable, corny as hell and of course the baddies are so archetypically baddy. There's nothing subtle here, though I did like Marmite product placement."
"2703","Le Mans '66",8,"Ken Miles!!!","Ford vs Ferrari... Great movie to respect Ken Miles. One of the greatest road racers ever."
"2704","Le Mans '66",9,"Excellent acting by the entire cast","Excellent acting by the entire cast. The race scenes convey the power and danger of the races."
"2705","Le Mans '66",10,"Incredible piece of entertainment!","What a great movie this was! It has been some time since I felt so excited while watching a movie. It is simply great, no wonder why it was nominated, I hope it wins! GO WATCH IT! Superb!"
"2706","Le Mans '66",9,"Rushing to the finish","After being very behind with film watching and reviewing, a lot of my reviews this year being dedicated to individual episodes of shows, completest quests and some cartoons, finally made the decision to watch more films released this year and to finally review the films seen earlier this year but hadn't gotten round to seeing. 'Le Mans 66' was a very eagerly anticipated film, due to liking the lead actors and loving 'Rush' that this has been compared to by some, and one of the year's (quite hit and miss) more acclaimed films, so there was not any doubt about seeing it.'Le Mans 66' (often advertised though under the easier to remember title of 'Ford v Ferrari') doesn't disappoint a vast majority of the time, almost everything is right with it. Found it an exceptionally well made, acted, written and enthralling film and one of the year's must sees, also one of the few films this year where the advertising actually did it justice which is such a rarity in film (having lost count of the number of great films that were criminally mismarketed or misleadingly so). Seeing as 2019 has been another hit and miss year, with a fair share of good to brilliant films, a fair share of mediocre films or less (including clunkers) and films sitting in between, that is saying a fair bit actually and am not trying to sound like a snob here.It isn't without its flaws, though they are hardly any. Did find the character of Peter and his scenes rather too twee for my liking, like when the film cutaways to him where he pointlessly explains the action. 'Le Mans 66' already had a lot of emotional impact of all kinds, the character and his presence just didn't seem necessary.Maybe it is a little too long too, it could easily have done with being perhaps 15 minutes shorter and lessening or excising Peter's role would have made things better.However, 'Le Mans 66' looks great. Especially the editing, which is actually quite astonishing in the action-oriented scenes and can see some kind of nod for Best Editing at any of the big awards. Likewise with the sound editing, which is quite striking in its authenticity, 'Le Mans 66' capturing the spirit of the sport and the personal lives behind it beautifully. James Mangold's direction is stylish throughout, the action-oriented scenes have plenty of thrills and mostly the personal lives scenes are emotionally investable.Script is tightly structured and is nicely balanced. The story is always well balanced and some twee moments aside is always compelling. The climactic race is absolutely thrilling in every sense of the word. All the performances are spot on, with Matt Damon giving one of his better and most good-natured performances and Tracy Letts excels in his role, especially in his post-drive breakdown and his frankness during the Ford executive presentation. Best of all is Christian Bale in the film's most demanding role, he captures the uncomprimising attitude needed brilliantly.All in all, excellent and one of 2019's highlights when it comes to film. 9/10"
"2707","Le Mans '66",10,"For me, the best Movie in 2019","I have to say, I am a big fan of fast cars. And I am a big fan of Christian Bale and Matt Damon. So this Movie should be good. But this Movie was Awesome! It has it all. You Laugh, you cry and it is exciting!This Movie is not made for Petrolheads only, its a Movie for everyone!"
"2708","Le Mans '66",8,"I'd have preferred to see Michael Mann's version, but this is an impressive and heartfelt study of friendship and triumph","Based on A.J. Baime's Go Like Hell: Ford, Ferrari, and Their Battle for Speed and Glory at Le Mans (2009), written by Jason Keller, Jez Butterworth, and John-Henry Butterworth, and directed by James Mangold, Le Mans '66 (released in North American with the equally generic title of Ford v Ferrari) counts Michael Mann as an executive producer. This is notable, as Mann himself has been trying to bring an adaptation of Brock Yates's Enzo Ferrari: The Man, the Cars, the Races (1991) to the screen since at least 1993. Indeed, at one point, Mann's Enzo Ferrari was set to star Christian Bale, before he was replaced with Hugh Jackman. Whether or not it will ever be made is open to speculation, but it seems unlikely in the wake of Mann's involvement with Le Mans '66, an excellently made but unadventurous movie.Mangold is a fine director, but he's no Mann, nowhere near, and the film did, to a certain extent, leave me pondering what kind of kinetic brilliance Mann would have brought to similar material. In contrast to Mann's body of work, Le Mans '66 could never be accused of breaking any new ground or trying anything especially original - it hits all the beats, it hits them well, but it never strays from the formula. Looking at issues such as friendship, male pride, personal integrity, sticking it to the Man, art v commerce, individuals v corporations; it is, in essence, a thematically broad and aesthetically anonymous pre-auteur theory audience-pleaser made with the technology and aesthetic sensibilities of modernity. And whilst the individual parts may be unsatisfactorily safe and familiar, the whole is unexpectedly accomplished and immensely enjoyable.The film begins in 1959 as Carroll Shelby (Matt Damon) wins that year's Le Mans, only to be told he has a heart condition and must stop racing. Cut to 1963, and Henry Ford II (a superb Tracy Letts, who steals every scene he's in) has just had an offer to purchase Ferrari rejected and been personally insulted by Ferrari himself (Remo Girone). Livid, Ford II determines to build a car capable of winning Le Mans, which Ferrari has won in 1958, 1960, 1961, 1962, and 1963. Ford Vice President and General Manager Lee Iacocca (Jon Bernthal) contacts Shelby, the last non-Ferrari driver to have won the event, and asks him to design a car. He gets to work but says they'll need a great driver as well as a well-designed car. He reaches out to Ken Miles (Bale), who has a reputation as one of the best drivers in the world, and is renowned for his almost supernatural ability to identify problems in test cars after only one or two laps. However, because of his volatility and unpredictable personality, few want to work with him. He comes on board, but immediately clashes with the Ford executives, particularly Senior Executive Vice President Leo Beebe (Josh Lucas).Le Mans '66 is somewhat similar to Michael Mann's Ali (2001), insofar as it uses the grandiose moments of history to tell an intimate story - Mangold uses the determination to win Le Mans '66 as the background against which to examine issues such as friendship and the clash between gifted individuals for whom success is its own reward and corporations who don't see value in anything unless it's monetarily successful. Indeed, the argument could be made that the film is actually a commentary on the Hollywood studio system, with Shelby and Miles representing independent filmmakers who love the craft and see the medium as an art-form, whilst the Ford executives represent the studio, always more concerned with the bottom dollar than artistic integrity, always getting in the way of the people who, if left alone to work, could produce something spectacular (we'll ignore the fact that the whole thing feels like it was made by an algorithm designed to hit as many clichéd feel-good moments as possible).The film is also extremely funny in places, especially in a scene where Shelby shows up at Miles's house, and the two get into a fight on the street. Miles's wife Mollie (an underused Caitriona Balfe) emerges from the house, looks at the two men fighting, goes back inside, and remerges with a garden chair, a drink, and a copy of Better Living. She then sits down to watch the action. It's a hilarious moment, but it's one with great thematic importance - this is very much an androcentric world (Mollie is virtually the only female in the entire film), but for this brief moment, the audience is allowed to pull back and laugh at the utter ridiculousness of competitive maleness - boys will be clichéd boys, always trying to outdo each other, and getting all worked up over something as pointless as a fast car.This thematic focus, however, is not to say the film ignores the intricacies of racing; on the contrary, there's a huge amount of techno-babble concerning vectors, aerodynamics, the mathematics of torque, the torsion of metal, and the ins and outs of physics. Additionally, although thematically, the focus isn't on the races themselves, there's no denying that the aesthetic design of these scenes is exemplary, albeit familiar. Mann would have done wonders here, but Mangold, cinematographer Phedon Papamichael, and sound designers David Giammarco and Jay Wilkinson have crafted some truly intense moments. For the most part, Mangold and Papamichael avoid any objective shots (for example, there are no overheads giving us a good vantage of the entire race), and there are very few shots showing us something that Miles is unable to see. The scenes aren't shot in the first-person, but our vision is anchored to his. This, of course, contributes to a subjective focalisation and creates the sense of being in the car with him, which brings a default level of intensity, as well as giving the viewer a perfect vantage point from which to see just how fast these guys are going and how difficult what they do actually is.In terms of problems, there are only two of significance. The first concerns just how safe and rudimentary the film is. Aesthetically, although the race scenes are kinetic and exciting, there isn't anything new or inventive in them; thematically, the film doesn't say anything we haven't heard before; and structurally, it walks a very well-worn path - chances are that everything that you think might happen in Le Mans '66 does happen. This is your basic underdog story, and it adheres rigidly to that template. The character of Beebe is a good example of just how rigidly. In essence, he's a poorly written token villain because you can't have an underdog story without a token villain (usually in the form of bureaucratic interference). In this case, when Mangold feels the need to inject some conflict into proceedings, Beebe will pop up to throw a wrench into the works. His motivation? Apart from some brief references to how he doesn't think Miles is a ""Ford man"", his antipathy is never explained - the character is a Swiss army knife villain who can be used for multiple purposes, a one-size-fits-all bad guy without an iota of nuance or interiority. The second problem concerns Shelby himself, who is disappointingly one-dimensional (at best), as we learn absolutely nothing about his personal life - for example, the film makes no reference to the fact that by 1963 he was on wife number three (of seven!). Who is the film's Carroll Shelby, and why should non-racing fans care about him? We never get an answer - he's Matt Damon wearing a Stetson and speaking with a Texas drawl. And that's about all the character development he gets.Although these issues are significant in isolation, the thing about Le Mans '66 is that it's so well made, it rises above the clichéd and overly-familiar nature of many of the individual scenes, resulting in a whole that is very much more than the sum of its parts. A film about friendship and integrity rather than racing, it doesn't take any risks, nor does it bend any rules. Indeed it does nothing that could be labelled innovative. For all that, however, I couldn't help but enjoy it. It won't surprise you, it probably won't move you, it certainly won't change your life, but the storytelling is clear and refined, and the journey is one well worth taking."
"2709","Le Mans '66",10,"We are in the dark ages of writing in movies... BUT","This movie was perfect. I really don't care about cars or racing at all. I just love Christian Bale movies so I thought I'd take my dad to go see it. He's a big car junkie so I thought he'd like it. When the movie finished, the entire movie theater clapped. That was a first for me in my lifetime (I'm 25). Bale and Damon's acting was incredible. For a long movie, it went by quickly. The writing THANK GOD was perfect. There are so many awful movies and TV shows with some of the worst writing I've ever heard. I seriously feel like we are in the dark ages of theater. There are about 2 movies a year that are good. I rarely mark movies as a 10, but when I left the theater, I couldn't help but mark it down as a 10. I loved the movie from start to finish."
"2710","Le Mans '66",10,"Got Me Back to the Movie Theater","I generally don't enjoy going to the movies anymore since I can wait a few months and watch on our big screen in the comfort of my own home but I was excited to see this movie. We saw it the day it opened in our local theater and I was not disappointed. What a great film. Damon and Bale were fantastic from beginning to end. The characters were very well developed and you actually felt like you knew these guys! The whole cast was phenomenal. I'm not much of a race car fan but this movie had suspense and humor that made it entertaining for everyone! Well done!!"
"2711","Le Mans '66",9,"The perfect balance","You know the best part of the whole movie? It's not Bale, Damon or the cars. They and the cars are already on the respected list. It's the ""background music"". Every time BGM began, it pumped me up. My adrenaline rush felt amazing. It makes any car/bike enthusiast, respect their ride. I had some good cars and I'm missing them all so much right now. Returning back home from the movie, the music in my car was all the way to the sky and I sat for another few mins in the car even after reaching my destination. This is what the movie did to me.Peace out!"
"2712","Le Mans '66",8,"Engaging Action Film","""Ford v Ferrari"" is an engaging action film based on a true story, when the American manufacturer Ford decided to build the racing car Ford GT40 to defeat the Italian Ferrari at the ""24 Hours of Le Mans"" in 1966. The plot is dramatic, funny, highly entertaining and not historically accurate (in accordance with those that are fans of car racing), with Matt Damon and the magnificent Christian Bale in the lead roles. But the film never disappoints the fans of a great action film.Christian Bale was nominated in the Golden Globe in the category Best Performance by an Actor in a Motion Picture - Drama and ""Ford v Ferrari"" was Oscar Winner in the Best Achievement in Film Editing and Sound Editing and nominated to the Best Motion Picture of the Year and Best Achievement in Sound Mixing. These awards and nominations would suffice to indicate how good this film is and the viewer does not need to be a car racing fan to like and enjoy it. My vote is eight.Title (Brazil): ""Ford vs Ferrari"" (""Ford v Ferrari"")"
"2713","Le Mans '66",3,"Could have been epic, ruined by cliches, and a total apathy for accuracy, film pace and realism","If you know bugger all about racing and don't care about an avalanche of Hollywood cliches, I'm sure you will love this. It's beautiful, Bale and Damon are wonderful as always, the sound it wonderful and there are more than one funny scene that made me laugh.However, if you are interested in racing and Le Mans, you will find this toe curling. First of all because of all the cliches are just standing in line for the full length of the movie. Most of all the ever-present protagonist-driver-changes-gear-and-reveals-that-he-hadn't-floored-the-accelerator-until-now stupidity. In fact they repeat this once every five minutes. And of course the drivers' ability to look over at other drivers for seconds at a time while they sit in a race car that does 974 km/h! Oh and of course the Hollywood cliche that never fails: Le Mans drivers that drive like it's stock car racing. Slamming into each other, going off the road intentionally, spinning and crashing out in epic fireballs ... they are all there in their vomit inducing glory. There's the totally unrealistic racing environment, handling of the race cars, driver and pit crew behaviour, a totally unbelievable person gallery and a farcical historical depiction. And of course there is the oh-so-evil suit and tie wearing villains and the oh-so-good heroes, which we are supposed to believe actually existed.Sigh! I felt absolutely nothing for any of the people at the end. Neither for the good guys nor the bad. If you are a racing fan, don't go watch this garbage."
"2714","Le Mans '66",1,"First time I have left a Cinema...","Well at thirty years of age this was the first time my partner and I had ever walked out of a cinema before the movie had finished...As a petrolhead I should have loved this film. I know the story, I have seen the documentaries, I have watched the old films. An actor I had been working with mentioned it to me a year previously as he had landed a supporting role, I was excited by the prospect of a new film for motorsport fans such as myself. After seeing the trailer I remained excited, and yet slightly nervous about the handling of it.After the first twenty minutes I turned to my fiance and stated ""this had better improve""....after 45 minutes, I was ready to leave. We stayed for an hour as we had bought drinks and hoped things would improve. But there was simply no way I was going to make it through the full runtime of this movie.The writing and direction is just so cliche and cheesy, it wreaks of hamfisted Americanism, how people are claiming this will be up for awards is beyond me. It could have been written by a high school drama student. There were moments that were pure cringeworthy.I am deeply disappointed by this movie, I expected far more from everybody involved. Visually it's okay to look at, as it has the budget of a Hollywood Blockbuster. But beyond that, you'll be watching much of it through gritted teeth."
"2715","Le Mans '66",10,"Flying by the seat of the pants","It just felt like the 60s when I was a kid. Uncomplicated and risky. But it was fun. And this movie reminded me exactly of the attitudes of the times. For me this was just such a rare and treasured experience. I watched the movie from start to finish and every time I had to leave it for a minute, I had to rush back to make sure I didn't miss anything. How can I explain what I was seeing? Enjoyable action performed by masterful actors woven into a meaningful story. Friendship, challenge and trust all displayed in a way that I could enjoy. Trial and error engineering before computers took over the decision process ... wow what a magical time to be alive. The Le Mans wins by the Ford GT40 on 66, 67, 68 and 69 ... epic effort and akin to the first Moon landing as far as motor sports is concerned. In this current political landscape, I can imagine that people who weren't alive then, being dismissive of this story. But for me it was a magical experience and I am grateful that this movie was created."
"2716","Le Mans '66",8,"Good.","Not a massive fan of motor racing or motor racing movies but i did enjoy this.
The major asset for the film is the cast, Matt Damon is very good but the real star of this is the fantastic Christian Bale, a superb performance from a great actor.
The story of an unsung British hero, a very modest and a very real hero, he did really drive a tank in WW2, is a tale very much worth telling.
It is long bit flies by - go see."
"2717","Le Mans '66",9,"Wow.","Laugh, cry, get the feels, this movie has it all. Christian bale shines as always and Matt damon loves chewing gum. I wonder what kind of gum he was chewing for 78% of the movie. Anyway it was great I just thought that was funny. If you love cars it's a plus. I almost skeeted my pants like 4 times during this movie."
"2718","Le Mans '66",6,"Massively overrated at 8/10","A huge disappointment for racing fans ( and who else would watch this sort of film ?). No mention of the original designer of the GT40 Eric Broadley of British car maker Lola on whose GT mk VI the Ford was based. No mention of Denny Hulme who co-drove with Ken Miles. It's as if he didn't exist. WTF ?!The largely hammy acting by Christian Bale also a let down as Miles' brummie accent sounded more like cockney in Bale's portrayal. Really poor dialogue and not even close to the real story. The best thing about the film was the racing machinery used but in the driving sequences a car wouldn't have lasted 5 minutes the way Bale smashed through the gears.Nowhere near the class of the racing classics Grand Prix and Le Mans."
"2719","Le Mans '66",9,"I'm not a car or racing guy, and I loved it.","You don't have to go in with any prior knowledge of vehicles, Ford, or racing history. It may help with feeling more attached to the characters but I feel this movie did a great job with character development. Great sound track. Great racing scenes. Great sound effects. Great acting. I went in expecting a boring ""dad movie"" and when the movie ended I had tears in my eyes and I had a whole new appreciation for the sport. It also felt like a nice history lesson. Don't do any prior research to the film and go in with an open mind, and enjoy the amazing performances by Christian Bale and Matt Damon."
"2720","Le Mans '66",8,"Laps of happiness but sorro-awful at the end","Shellby is leading the Le Mans where he is focused, determined and one could easily hear his heartbeat and hot breath in a fading raving engine sound mastered by a genius sound editing. The future is not too bright for Miles Ford and Ferrari but unlike Miles he does not hold the cards in life.. When people in high places determine people's fate, trusting a friend who is controlled by such is not that easy. But the Miles-Shellby bond is a prime example of great casting. In the end, your fate is determined by people in suits; mirroring why unchecked heights of inequality can determine people's fate in our this era. The tragedy of Miles losing his life was not the awful end to such a great picture but how weak dialogue and script diluted an already bubbling 120mins of great acting and powerful zoom-ins."
"2721","Le Mans '66",8,"Great Racing Drama","It's a good film, with good performances from Christan bale and matt damon, Racing scenes are amazingly shot with great sound effects."
"2722","Le Mans '66",9,"I don't even like cars","But this movie got my gears grinding and I was on the edge of my seat the whole time, the chemistry between Matt and Christian, legendary."
"2723","Le Mans '66",8,"So. Damn. Fun.","Damon did Damon things, and Bale did Bale things. More importantly, this movie managed to be sports-y and non-sports-y all at once. You still get all the adrenaline and polish of a giant victory rally, but you also get the kind of character-driven drama that's typically reserved for awards season. Let's be clear: this is a dad movie, and I am the target dad. But I have never cared about race cars or watched people turn left on TV...and I absolutely loved all 150 minutes of this story. Movies are supposed to help you forget real life and remember real life all at once. That's just what this one did."
"2724","Le Mans '66",10,"Spectacular.","Decided to make an account and write this review just because how much I liked the movie, the acting was spot on and so was the cinematography.
watch the movie, you won't regret it."
"2725","Le Mans '66",1,"Come ooon","I don't understand why this film is receiving so much recognition. It is a very bad movie with very mediocre acting (maybe even bad, cause too unrealistic and exaggerated), an unrealistic storyline, with dialogues that would never exist in the real world. I mean it's the classic american film that wants to glorify the american culture and all that. Maybe it was liked because of this. There are many stupid stereotypes too. This film don't deserve even a nomination at the oscars."
"2726","Le Mans '66",1,"Historically innaccurate.","Like many American films this title attempts to rewrite history.
The truth is that Ferrari were the complete underdog. What actually happened is that huge behemoth motor company Ford tried to buy the tiny Ferrari and Enzo said no. Ford threw their toys out of the pram and decided to build the GT40. With their limitless budget it took a few years for them to finally succeed at beating the tiny Ferrari company at Le Mans. And even when they did, Ford used a 5 litre engine versus Ferrari's 3 litre.
This film needs remaking to tell what really happened and who the reall heroes were. They would be wearing red overalls thats for sure."
"2727","Le Mans '66",6,"Too long, too many clichés","Not worth watching. Its exceedingly long for a movie composed entirely by stereotypes and american clichés. Some of the acting is good but it does not make up for the rest of the movie. Very commercial and not so entretaining."
"2728","Le Mans '66",9,"Amazing.","Breath of fresh for the film industry. Really enjoyed this one... I regret watching it on a small screen!!!"
"2729","Le Mans '66",7,"No Bat-Mobile, but still a thrill ride from Bale!","This movie has as much traction and grip, as the car that won Le Mans 66!Another stunning performance by Christian Bale (without any body transformation this time!) and the same goes for Jon Bernthal! Yes, this movie might be 20mins to long, but it takes you on a long and exciting ride with an end you won't see coming, unless you spoil yourself with how the race in '66 ended - my advice: DON'T! it will pay off.I'm a Formula 1 enthusiast and occasionally watch the Le Mans races as well, so I wasn't aware how the race in '66 ended. I wasn't even aware of the rivalry between Ford and Ferrari back then, but this movie won't bore you with the details to much. It gives the necessary overview of the needed context, so that every viewer understands what's on the line here.I'd recommend a viewing in an IMAX for sure, to feel the sound and experience the race for yourself. Much like Rush, this movie manages to get the excitement of racing transformed to the audience, without focussing on any crashes or the (back then) still live threatening motorsport."
"2730","Le Mans '66",1,"A tragic waste of time","Disrespectful towards Italians; the writing around Ferrari is just like about Super Mario tbh; poor, cheesy, childish; maybe Hollywood should keep its mediocre movies made exclusively for patriotic and nationalistic reasons, to Americans only. Also, I thought Bale was exquisite playing the mad boxer part a while back, which earned him an Oscar - he tries the same here, but soulless. Should have the option to give it zero."
"2731","Le Mans '66",9,"Genuinely engaging","Such a fun, engaging movie. I saw some critics say it was too long, but for someone who takes sometimes several additional hours, days, even, to get through a movie due to ADD and a short attention span, this film raced by.The character work with Miles was so great as to get the viewer on his side from the start, and Bale's performance was exactly what the movie needed to create a guy in which we're so invested. It's the combination of passion, skill, and knowledgeability that makes Ken Miles THE guy to root for.Matt Damon was good, however I think he could be replaced with virtually any other actor and the movie would be unchanged.The character building we are given before, the villainization of the Ford team; they inject the racing sequences with the same suspense and adrenaline present when your home team is fighting for a championship title. We not only have a favorite, we have rivals.And oh, what a twist--what a soul-crushing twist. I almost couldn't finish the movie. I had to look up whether it was real in the hopes that it wasn't. It's one of those times that you just wished based on a true story was fiction so as to console yourself."
"2732","Le Mans '66",9,"Entertaining In Every Way A Film Can Be","I've never watched a car race in my life. I have absolutely no knowledge of the historic events surrounding the Ford and Ferrari motor companies. None of those two things mattered in my viewing experience of ""Ford v Ferrari"". Not only does it allow the viewer to be a complete clean slate, but it provides the utmost of entertainment on almost every front.For a very basic overview, this movie tells the story of how the Ford Motor Company was struggling in the 1960s and thus turned to racing cars to give their image a boost. The problem? For years, Ferrari has been the gold standard in that theater. But with Carroll Shelby (Matt Damon) overseeing the project and the volatile Ken Miles (Christian Bale) in the driver's seat, they set out to take down Ferrari at the 1966 24 Hours of Le Mans race.One of the main strengths of ""Ford v Ferrari"" is that it tells a bunch of different stories within the basic framework. Not only is it the clash that the title anticipates, but also a story of personal redemption for Shelby, one of personal goal-achievement for Miles, and even a healthy dose of ""big corporation screwing over the little guy"" thrown in. All of those angles are very distinct, with nothing muddled along the way. The 2.5 hour runtime really helps with this, allowing such arcs to play out in their entirety.The acting is also incredible from basically the entire cast. Bale gives a unique, quirky performance as seemingly only he can, Damon is solid (as always), and everyone else does their part admirably. Especially affecting are Miles' wife Mollie (Caitriona Balfe) and son Peter (Noah Jupe), who both provide much of the sentimental emotions present in the film. A specific scene where Ken explains to Peter exactly what he does on each individual racing lap is as good as acting gets.There's also a never-ending sense of forward momentum and just overall fun to ""Ford v Ferrari"". It never takes itself too seriously, yet it isn't a comedy. It's long, but doesn't feel that way due to the expert pacing--a perfect balance of pulse-pounding action scenes and slower, more emotional scenes within the understated 1960s period feel. Director James Mangold probably deserves a good amount of the credit for making this all congeal together as well as it did.Overall, this is a spectacular film precisely because it can hit audiences in so many different ways. Whether through the action, emotion, true story, or underlying themes, most viewers will be able to find something to enjoy here. Even if, like I said before, no previously knowledge of racing is present."
"2733","Le Mans '66",9,"A wild ride","I loved it was intense and exciting at the same time the cast was great and the car scenes where great to the racing was amazing I loved it considering I grew up loving cars Ford vs Ferrari gets a 9-10 perfect movie great racing"
"2734","Le Mans '66",9,"Great performances and a lot of fun!","What a treat! I really enjoyed this movie and on numerous occasions found my heart pounding with excitement whilst grinning from ear to ear! Excellent film! Definitely worth seeing."
"2735","Le Mans '66",9,"Master class","Brilliant acting, brilliant storyline and the way it was done. Have the feel for old school and being there feeling the betrayal and emotions"
"2736","Le Mans '66",9,"Race enthusiasts","A beautiful movie, especially for racing and speed car enthusiasts, the level of the main actors (Christian and Matt) was very cool, photography, montage, lighting, photography, and clothes were very cool and perfect! The most beautiful thing about the movie is the sensation of excitement and the unpredictability of upcoming events. You will not feel like watching a biography, and I think this is a strength!"
"2737","Le Mans '66",8,"Cor Blimey, what a Picture!","The story of Carroll Shelby and Ken Miles gets the Hollywood treatment in this nostalgic look at the motor racing scene of the 60's. It also succeeds in harking back to the kind of films Hollywood doesn't make any more.Although this is in many ways a standard three act rise, fall and rise again narrative it's elevated by the excellent central and supporting performances. Damon is on top form as the bullish and ambitious good ol' boy Shelby. Compensating for his own enforced retirement as a driver by building up a successful race car construction company.Bale, as ever, gives a memorable portrayal as the flawed genius Ken Miles. Quick tempered but never nasty, a loveable rogue and family man whose own driving career could clearly have been one of true greatness if not for his inability to compromise or bite his tongue.The two leads rock and roll throughout proceedings, quick to clash but quick to make up again and once on board with the Ford motor company (who are desperate to end Ferrari's dominance of the Le Mans) the film really cooks.The Ford suits are played fairly stereotypically but Josh Lucas is the film's real hissable villain. Playing the smarmy exec role to perfection.Events play out much as you would expect but no less entertaining for it. Even the somewhat cliched speeches and corny English asides (all English people love cups of tea and say Cor Blimey!) Don't detract from the thrills.The racing scenes are noisy and muscular, visceral in the same way as Ron Howard's Rush and put you right in the driving seat. And the final race is the highlight. Here the story even manages a slight twist I didn't see coming and stops the film veering into well worn ground.Top notch stuff, well worth watching."
"2738","Le Mans '66",NA,"Great movie","I enjoyed every moment of this movie. Great story and wonderful acting. I already knew a little bet of the story because it was mentioned in Grand Tour but still it was very entertaining"
"2739","Le Mans '66",9,"A old-fashioned and engaging racing biopic.","I'm going to be posting the rest of my reviews for 2019 here now that the Academy Award nominations are upon us.Starting off with surprise best picture contender ""Ford v Ferrari""; this is a fascinating and entertaining examination of the real life rivalry between both companies, without resorting to simplicity or being too vague for non-automobile enthusiasts.Christian Bale, in all his British glory, knocked it out of the park as the firey Ford racer Ken Miles, and Matt Damon gives one of his finest recent performances as his sidekick Carroll Shelby. The rest of the cast are also great to see.If you haven't already seen it, definitely race out as soon as it's available to you and check it out.
Grade- A"
"2740","Le Mans '66",8,"Racing with a soul","As a Ferrari fan I was pleasantly on the side of a Ford driver, all because of the soul Christian Bale was able to portrayed as Ken Miles, a sports car racing engineer who's hart was beaten in unison with an engine of a race car. Aside of the fact that he lose several kg for the role, but being a method actor it cling a viewer to the screen. Excitement and rage can be feel in every scene. The passion take us to the circuit and made us push the accelerator. What I miss is the surprise of the plot since I knew the story. The cast is brilliant, and finally in one Americans movie I have the pleasure to see casted Italians brilliants actor for the roles of the Ferrari Team, speaking perfect Italian, as oppose as being disappointed when they cannot.
This year oscar is going to be a difficult choice."
"2741","Le Mans '66",8,"Quite watchable","Very good, and the photography from the racing scenes is amazing....but be prepared, probably 5% - 7% of screen time is focused on the footwork of shifting gears, braking or accelerating!"
"2742","Le Mans '66",9,"A Experience that makes me want to know more about cars.","Seeing this movie in the cinema is another thing, in the racing parts it is as if we were driving. Christian Bale makes an excellent performance, for me deserving of Oscar nomination, Matt Damon and Jon Bernthal perform as always, as the rest of the actors. Briefly one of the best movies of 2019, we highly recommend watching at the cinema."
"2743","Le Mans '66",8,"Good movie. Great dialouge","One of the better movies I have watched out of the last 15hours of recent films I've endured through.
Great acting, natural dialogue that's super relatable.... all up an entertaining film, with racing scenes that any rev head would appreciate."
"2744","Le Mans '66",9,"Beautiful","The scenes from the track as the cars running are phenomenal"
"2745","Le Mans '66",8,"Well done","Great story of Miles and Shelby. How they build a car worth risking. Nicely done movie . Emotions, power, engines, speed and CARS. Well done"
"2746","Le Mans '66",9,"A Classic Film","More than the Racing Stuff, loved alot of the Emotional stuff it holds. Yet it offers some Goosebumps in particular the 1st Race of Ken. Unexpected Ending thoughBoth Bale & Demon just Rocks the Role of Ken & Shellby"
"2747","Le Mans '66",9,"Stunning!","This film is like the cars it portrays. Slick on the surface, but complicated underneath. Yes it's a story born of corporate ambition in horn rimmed glasses and dark suits, driven by pride and stubbornness, but the heart of it is pure racing, to hell with money, marketing, good looks, any of that. I've watched half of this with my foot planted to the floor. The driving scenes are awesome, the roar of untamed engines (turn your sound up as loud as you dare!), shifting gears into blindness inducing speeds. Fast cars alone though can't carry a film, but thankfully the cast here is as great as the cars. Damon is very good as the lynchpin Shelby, as he drags Ford away from mass production and onto the racetrack to challenge Ferrari's dominance. Bale though, Bale is magnificent. His portrayal of somewhat renegade driver Ken Miles is the oil in the engine, the comic undertones with a 'my way or the highway' attitude. He literally drives this. The pacing is spot on, balancing the boardroom with the tarmac perfectly, all done with some Oceans 11 style slick, good ol rock n roll blasting out as men do manly things. It's a show piece with Ferrari painted as the bad guy. I'm fine with that. Yes the cars look sexy, ""If this were a beauty pageant, we just lost"", but gimme the brute force of the Ford GT40 any day. There's a ton of excitement and energy before the cars even get to Le Mans, but seeing that GT tear up the French countryside gets the heart pounding. Doesn't matter that I already knew the outcome, it's still exhilarating with some of the best racing scenes in any film, ever!"
"2748","Le Mans '66",8,"Solid","Beautiful film, kind of same old same old but adds its own depth. The performances of the cast is phenomenal, beautiful chemistry and look the film has. Great for the family. I hope Matt Damon gets nominated for an Oscar for his performance too. Christian Bale got a nom for the golden globes so I'm sure he's getting one too. Script is fine, director did great solid 8"
"2749","Le Mans '66",9,"Very close to reality and a must watch.","The blend of reality, excitement, community, passion, racing all captured very well. Christian Bale, you are just amazing. Huge respect to both Ford and Ferrari. Both Giants of racing."
"2750","Le Mans '66",8,"2.5 hours flew by as if it were going 7000+ RPM","This has become my favorite car movie as there are no distracting sub-plots about love or whatever.
This is a straight forward car movie based on real events and the 2 and a half hours went by as if the movie was going 7000 RPMAmazing acting throughout8.2"
"2751","Le Mans '66",9,"Chikaboom-chikaboom boom boom boom","Great movie Amazing performance and acting, The Amazing soundtrack"
"2752","Le Mans '66",9,"Really great movie","Ford v Ferrari was really a great movie. Just solid on all levels. Great script, acting, and story was told in a really great way. The driving sequences were really exciting and felt like we were there on the race track. Enjoyed this one alot!"
"2753","Le Mans '66",6,"A well-made, overly long, utterly predictable and formulaic feelgood underdog story that has been done to death","Ford v Ferrari is a well-made, well-shot film with some very good acting. It is also an utterly boring, predictable, by-the-numbers sports/competition success story, and that is its damning flaw. The plot contains almost conceivable cliche that can be found in this sort of movie, hitting all the usual story beats. A hastily-assembled crew of outcasts being given a seemingly impossible task against an unbeatable sports rival, dealing with their personal problems and struggling against the interference of smug, suited corporate figures who do not like the fact that our heroes are not types who play by the book, and growing as characters along the way. Directing-wise, this plot comes with all the usual accoutrements, the most obvious of which is montages where the team of underdogs progress in their quest.The result is a movie where one can easily guess all the plot points and how the next scene is going to play out. Even the lighthearted, comedic moments happen exactly the way such scenes happen in every other movie of this kind. All of this especially becomes a problem when it is far longer than it should be. And despite the bloated runtime, some story elements somehow remain underwhelming. We know that the main characters are good friends simply because the script pretty much tells us so, but this is not properly set up. Some of the context and the events that drive the story forward are difficult to figure out, although this may be less so for viewers who are familiar with the racing context and the real-life events. In addition, it is sad that for a movie titled Ford v Ferrari, we never really see the events from the Italians' side, who remain bumbling foes beset by their overconfidence throughout the film.All of this is not the say that the movie is not well-made. It is, despite the obvious CGI-y look of some of the racing scenes, and this is pretty much the reason behind my 6/10 score. If you are a diehard racing fan, or -for whatever reason- have never seen a sports/competition movie of this kind, you might really like it. Otherwise, the redeeming qualities of the picture are not enough to save it from being pretty much a total bore."
"2754","Le Mans '66",10,"I Loved This Movie!","I went into Ford v Ferrari a little unsure, as I'm not a huge racing fan, and wondered if the movie might be boring to me. My worry was unfounded - Ford v Ferrari is the best movie I've seen all year. It's surprisingly funny, completely engaging, historically accurate, and now my favorite Christian Bale movie. In fact, you'll forget you're watching Matt Damon and Christian Bale as they both completely disappear into their characters. So no spoilers here, just a recommendation to go see a great movie."
"2755","Le Mans '66",10,"Bale does it again....","Bit surprised to see the overall Box office collection... This movie deserves more...."
"2756","Le Mans '66",7,"Bale is superb, but the content wasn't for me","Going in, I knew this film had no shot of being a 10/10 for me. I am about as far from a gearhead or racing fan as one can be. With that being said, I was still intrigued throughout the entire 2.5 hour run time. Christian Bale dominated the screen with his performance. I expect great things from him, but he really did outdo himself by portraying the oddities and ego of his character. If you are a fan of cars or racing, I imagine you will love Ford v Ferrari."
"2757","Le Mans '66",10,"A Must See Story!","Few movies I will pay the expense of going to see because of the high prices of theaters these days. This is one of those films. Just came back and must say. It delivered! Well thought out and told. Matt and Christian as always shined in this project. In my personal opinion Matt & Christian are two of our times greatest actors. They don't play a role, they live it. Go see this feature. You wont be disappointed. it's a great story that needed to be told, and in the hands of those two. Well worth your time. 5 Stars*****!"
"2758","Le Mans '66",6,"A goofy attempt","I actually was pretty excited to see this movie. As an athlete myself I must say I usually don't agree with the hollywoodization of sports in general, but with Mangold at the helm and two of the best actors in the business as the main characters I got pretty optimistic.
Needless to say, all three mentioned above do their best, but the writting behind this movie is laughable at best. It tries really hard to be profound, with characters just charghing wrecklesly through the streets to show how pissed of they are, but it never really gets to the level of sentiment you would expect from and oscar nominated movie. I honestly don't know what got that nomination besides the shameless pro-american message.
Ford v Ferrari, which is not even the main thing about this movie, could be easily described like this: take a race car driver and put him in a movie that's not even about racing (it's unlikely it'll be any good). That's about the jist of it, just the other way round.
If you want to make a movie about a sport, just call someone who actually knows that field and listen to them. Sad to say, probably without his fault since it's a nicely passed, good looking movie, this is one of Mangold's misses.
Props to Bale for another great performance. Damon was fine, I guess. Also the movie is way too long at 2h and a half"
"2759","Le Mans '66",5,"Just simple and maybe a feel good movie for non-thinkers.","This is as simple as a kids Movie and the stereotype characters and simple-minded dialogues made me laugh. Womens (beside Ms. Miles) are completely missing. A lot of scenes are ungainly constructet (wheel nut, stopwatch, ...) or just boring. And why the hell Mr. Miles carries everywhere in the world everytime the same coffee pot? And beside all this to me the race scenes weren't really thrilling."
"2760","Le Mans '66",10,"Entertaining racing movie that'll make you sit on the edge of your seat.","One hell of a ride, your heart will beat and race faster while watching this movie especially if you are a fan of racing cars or etc. Directed by James Mangold (Logan, Walk the Line). Based on true story about American automotive designer Carroll Shelby (Matt Damon) and British race car driver Ken Miles (Christian Bale), together they plan to compete against the race cars of Enzo Ferrari at the 24 Hours of Le Mans in France in 1966. The story itself was so emotional and adrenalin pumping, I'd really recommend if you haven't know the story yet before watching this movie. I'm not really a fan of racing cars but I'm not disappointed either with this one, either you fan or not- you'll enjoy this movie.It's not just about the cars even the race or the business, that's why I liked this movie. It is personal, heartfelt, and touching. With all the long racing scene it won't even bore you, I wasn't even know before about the rivalry between Ford and Ferrari back then but big bravo on the writer and director, the racing scenes had me sitting up on the edge of my seat! This movie manages to get the audience feel the excitement and thrill of racing. A strong screenplay with phenomenal performance by Christian Bale and Matt Damon, not to mention other supporting actors like Noah Jupe and Josh Lucas. The chemistry between Bale and Damon is engaging, their characters fit so well.Solid movie from start to finish, I'd really recommend you to watch it with IMAX. One of the best movies for this year. The ending may wasn't explored enough but if you know the real story, you might know why it wasn't explored enough. It is for the best I guess."
"2761","Le Mans '66",4,"A formulaic, overly long, utterly predictable biopic.","My Rating : 4/10Extremely average movie, OK for a one-time viewing.The high ratings are absolutely fake according to me. The story also has been embellished to confuse the facts for cinematic effect. A real downer!I am not 'H-A-P-P-Y' after watching it - that's for sure!"
"2762","Le Mans '66",9,"Really Awesome","Ford V Ferrari (Director. James Mangold)James Magild once again delivers us another bloody great film. Ford v Ferrari is wild and thrilling film which I seriously did it expect to enjoy so much.At 153 minutes, the pacing honestly flies by. I wouldn't say it needed trimming down at all. The whole film is a load of fun, thanks to brilliant performances, a great script and racing scenes which are brilliantly directed and filled with so much energy. The last race is honestly so well done, it is one of the best film moments of the year. The visual effects are for the most part spectacular. Even the more drama scenes are still just as interesting.
Also ther racing scenes are downright brilliant with their sound mixing and editing.
Christian Bale once again proves he is one of the best actors of this generation. He alone makes the film worth watching. Noah Jupe, Matt Damon, Jon Berthnal and the rest of the cast are so amazing as well.
Overall it's one of the most energetic and memorable films of the year. Mangold is such an ace director and his talent really shines here. It's a really stylish film and such a likeable film and definitely worth watching.Overall Rating: A-"
"2763","Le Mans '66",5,"Far less than I expected","It's not a bad movie, but it's quite flat and nothing that you haven't seen before. Lacks in epic qualities and in depicting the true dangers of racing in those days. Forgettable soundtrack. See ""Rush"" for a far better outcome on all these aspects. The worst flaw is in the way they filmed the circuit De La Sarthe: first, there's no iconic shot on the Mulsanne straight, that's something I don't understand; secondly, they failed in showing what a grind was driving at 300kmh for three minutes, with a couple of very hard brakes. Also, they didn't show the slower classes of cars racing simultaneously, that were a true hazard. Overall, little remains for racing enthusiasts."
"2764","Le Mans '66",10,"A swift spike of beautiful cinema mastery","One of the best films of the year! Great enlightenment of incredible acting and magic in editing! Christian Bale's performance is a spark of excellence as always, he's one of the best actors in this generation. If I had one complaint it'd be that Matt Damon chews way to much gum but part of me thinks that added on his glorious performance. I really hope Ford Vs. Ferrari gets Oscar praise, it deserves every bit of love."
"2765","Le Mans '66",7,"Battle of Wills, Both On and Off the Racetrack","The (mostly) true story of two passionate gear-heads and their tireless quest to unseat mighty Team Ferrari at the grueling 24-hour Le Mans endurance race. Armed, that is, with the financial backing (and all-too frequent corporate meddling) of Ford Motor Company. In that sense, it's a war on two fronts: they're playing catch-up against a more advanced opponent while also fending off the various obstacles and bad ideas tossed down from their own corporate brass.Christian Bale and Matt Damon, somehow sharing the screen for the first time, provide all the personality this flick needs to maintain momentum, while the hair-raising cockpit scenes nail the hairpin turns. Bale plays the more fiery of the pair; a sparky, cocksure driver who comes out of near-retirement for this chance at immortality. Damon's man is full of piss and vinegar, too, but more amicable to the kind of machinations necessary for navigating a corporate American boardroom. From the first word, they're great together. It's not an easy relationship to define - blows are exchanged, often comically, more than once - but there's no arguing their kinship, even if both might brush it off as a mere working association. They both know the fine points of their job, and the slight quirks and deviations that make them essential to one another.Several of the film's plot twists are telegraphed, even for those (like I) who didn't know the full story coming in, and it's guilty of occasionally dipping into the well of over-worn sports movie tropes, but otherwise it's an effective pulse-pounder."
"2766","Le Mans '66",9,"Good movie for the entire family","I'm clearly not a fan of car racing, but I still managed to find this movie thoroughly enjoyable. It has a good combination of action sequences with family/friendly banter and there is something to enjoy in it for the whole family."
"2767","Le Mans '66",1,"Boring and irritating","If a movie gets that kind of budget and actors, you get punished with a score of one.
This movie only made it passed the 20 minute limit 'cause I was thinking about what to watch next.
I was immediately irritated by Bale's performance, and Matt Damon's character looked flat, boring, just doing his lines while trying constantly to put on his American charming smile. 5 minutes later I was done with this movie. Too many reviews promise a thrilling experience from beginning to end, don't go in with that expectation, and maybe you'll make it to the final lap."
"2768","Le Mans '66",10,"FLAWLESS, BEAUTIFUL AND RISKY: PERFECT","James Mangold fires a dart and hits the mark once again in his unique style and vision of the facts. A perfect film, exciting and with incredible energy. Perfect cast, from Jon Bernthal to Matt Damon, from Remo Girone to, of course, Mr. Christian Bale, the one who steals the scene and certainly in one of the strongest and most expressive interpretations of his career. Film that tells the story of the American dream in the racing circus and of the indomitable Ferrari. Flawless, beautiful and risky: perfect."
"2769","Le Mans '66",10,"This film is going to be a classic-not only in its genre","Christian Bale and Matt Damon - a combination which is perfect for cinema fans. This film is at least at the same level as ""Rush"" and sure one of the best films in 2019, which is tough in year where films like ""Parasite"" or ""Joker"" are the concurrence.
But this movie is not ment to be mentioned in the same list as those two films. Ford vs. Ferrari shows why and how cinema can be a wonderful experience again and again."
"2770","Le Mans '66",8,"old fashion greatness","Racing champ Carroll Shelby (Matt Damon) has to retire due to a medical issue. His racing friend Ken Miles (Christian Bale) is seen as difficult and the IRS has confiscated his garage. Ferrari has been at the top of racing in the 24 Hours of Le Mans. The Ford Motor Company finds its sales going stale and Henry Ford II wants a big idea. Marketing VP Lee Iacocca has the idea to enter the race. They first try to buy Ferrari and Enzo Ferrari insults Henry Ford II. Iacocca recruits Shelby to create a racing car and Shelby recruits Miles to be his driver.This is an old fashion rip roaring good times. Damon and Bale are great. All the actors are great whether it's Tracy Letts being told that he's not Henry Ford or the villainy of Josh Lucas. It's a solid sports underdog story. It's fun like Caitriona Balfe driving crazy. The race is thrilling. It is a perfectly made old fashion movie."
"2771","Le Mans '66",8,"Incredibly entertaining","It is the early-1960s and Ford Motor Corporation's fortunes are at a low ebb. In order to boost sales, Ford aims to win the Le Mans 24-hour race, a race dominated by Ferrari over the last few years. To head their team they call in Carroll Shelby, who won Le Mans in 1959. He in turn makes Ken Miles his chief test driver. Together they make a formidable team. However, it is not just Ferrari they have to worry about. Office politics and powerplays within Ford are an even greater threat to the success of the project.I did not have high hopes for this movie before watching it. Despite it being nominated for the Best Picture Oscar, it seemed just like a conventional revhead movie. Turns out, it's better than that, far better than that.Director James Mangold crafts a story that is highly engaging and very fast-paced. You wouldn't know the movie is 2 ½ hours long it is so engrossing: the time speeds by. The racing scenes are amazing, capturing the pace, danger and excitement of motor racing. Throw in good performances by Matt Damon and Christian Bale and you have a first-rate movie.Not perfect though. I found the political machinations a bit of a drag and contrived-feeling (even though many of them were true!). While Christian Bale puts in a good performance as Ken Miles, Miles's character is drawn rather stereotypically English, complete with ever-present cups of tea. It seemed a bit trite.Overall: highly entertaining. Don't be put off by the movie's duration: the time whizzes by."
"2772","Le Mans '66",9,"One of the best real life story movie","One of the best movie that I have seen, the racing of the cars was awesome."
"2773","Unhinged",7,"Most intense road rage movie since Spielberg's ""Duel""","You will never flip the bird to another driver again once you've seen ""Unhinged"".
This is the most intense road rage movie since Spielberg's ""Duel"" in the 70's with the pressures of life, marriage and death at its core.
Except the Truck is now just a Ford Pick Up with no discernible logos.
Obviously the Blue Oval didn't want to pay for product placement...it is an older model like its manic driver played by Russell Crowe.
This man can happen to anyone.
He only picks one project each year, but he chooses well.
His body of work speaks for itself.
His co-star Carin Pistorius moved to New Zealand as a child from South Africa and she brings a gritty, real performance to the big screen.
She also delivers the best action movie heroine line for 2020.
Veteran horror child actor, Gabriel Bateman, hold his own as her on screen son, Kyle.
This movie is adrenaline charged from the moment the curtain opens and rarely takes it foot off the pedal.
The road carnage and Rustys salary make up most of the 33 million dollar budget, but its investors will be making money off this film and buying many more new cars in the years ahead.
This is Crowe at his best and most threatening study of pure menace under Derrick Bortes direction."
"2774","Unhinged",5,"Unhinged, adjective. Meaning: unbalanced. A lot like this movie","There's nothing wrong a decent thriller where two people face off on the road using their wits and their heavy machinery. So this movie could have been the Duel (1971) of the 2020s (or at the very least a Joy Ride (2001)), but unfortunately, it lacks a director like Steven Spielberg or John Dahl to make it work.After a shocking opening scene, director Derrick Borte starts off nicely with a disturbing montage that shows us the horrible consequences of explosive aggression and road rage. For a long time, his movie seems to be a passionate plea to have more patience and compassion with others in a harsh society where everyone is under constant pressure, because you never know what the other person is going through. Too bad that he gradually undermines this message with cheap shocks and sadistic violence.It's good to see Russell Crowe again after such a long absence, because watching his heavily disturbed maniac snap and terrorize a lady that just happened to piss him off is definitely one of the scarce highlights of the film. No Oscar material, but the man is still an acting heavyweight (no pun intended... well, maybe a little), so much so that leading lady Caren Pistorius cannot hope to carry this movie in his presence. In fact, her character is so passive and uninteresting that I felt very little sympathy for her plight. I don't know if it was the intention here, but I always love movies where you cheer for the bad guy for a very long time, like Face-Off and Law Abiding Citizen; everyone loves tragic villains, and you always hope that the makers can delay that moment where you lose sympathy for them until the very last.Unfortunately, this moment comes way too soon in the movie. In the first half we get some motivation from Crowe's and Pistorius' character for their actions, but that wears off quickly in an endless rampage that seems to be an excuse for a lot of torture porn. There is nothing fundamentally wrong with that, as long as you keep developing your key players. Especially psychopaths work best when they remain completely unexplained mysteries, or when they get fleshed out properly, like the psychologic-meltdown classic Falling Down. However, Crowe and Pistorius never get beyond their minimal and one-dimensional backstories. When the bad guy gets to the point where I no longer rooted for him (again, way too soon), you hope that your allegiance changes back to the heroine. But Pistorius' character keeps making such bad decisions (up to and including a laughably set up climax) that by that time, I no longer cared about either, and could only worry about the collateral damage.Too bad for Crowe and Jimmi Simpson, who probably have one of the best scenes together when this movie is still promising. But the pressure to marry action with psychology, and to increase the stakes with such disregard for realism really starts working against the film and characters. I don't mind violence in movies at all, but it should make me invest in characters, not get desensitized and bored.I like a good battle of character like everyone else, but when the action and suspense start feeling stale because I'm no longer emotionally engaged, then it's just mostly a waste of time. But granted, it's not a complete disaster and it had its moments. I hear people praising this movie as super-suspenseful, so by all means, try it out. But don't say I didn't warn you."
"2775","Unhinged",8,"Fantastic movie, exciting every minute","This is one of the few movies, that are exciting every minute. The car chase is well done, it is pretty violent and Russel Crowe is very scary.Go and watch this movie. You'll have a great time."
"2776","Unhinged",8,"Brilliant, brutal thriller.","Wow. I wasn't expecting that. Absolutely brutal thriller with a powerhouse performance from Crowe. It's like a cross between Falling Down & Duel & escalates the tension really well, especially as the sound design is especially prominent helping to portray the heightened sense of drama. The opening credits are there to remind you that escalating violence is on the increase and this plays out as a frightening scenario as to what could potentially happen. I'm never using my car horn again."
"2777","Unhinged",10,"Mind-blowing","Best movie I have seen all year.
Russell crowe is outstanding in everyway."
"2778","Unhinged",2,"Unhinged in every way","Just appalling in every way, no plot, no background to the characters, worst Crowe movie ever, couldn't wait for it to be over. I have no idea what movie the other reviewers watched..."
"2779","Unhinged",6,"Ignore the negative critics and just enjoy it for what it is.","This film won't ever win any serious awards. It is nothing more than a short-shelf-life popcorn film and, for that, it is great. I wanted to escape for a couple of hours and have an entertaining time and, I did.Russell Crowe sure packed the weight on recently and in this, he is nothing short of a tank and whilst he was unpredictable, menacing and definitely unhinged - I can't help but feel it made certain parts of the film laughable (Hence the 6 out of 10). For example, if a guy of this size repeatedly punches a slim build woman than I doubt very much she is going to get back up again for another barrage of punches to land on her. The way Crowe moves, the force of his punches and the added sound effects of the ""impact"" make it sound like it would take someone's head clean off or, at the very least, knock them out cold. But, that's a minor gripe.Some of the scenes are pretty tense but if you know nothing about the film, I would avoid the trailers for they give way too much away.A cross between Joyride (Paul Walker) and Falling Down (Michael Douglas), although that's almost an insult to the latter.Yes it is paint by numbers filmmaking but if you want something well acted, enjoyable (if you like film violence) and looking to pass the time - you'll leave happy enough. You just probably won't return to watch it again any time soon."
"2780","Unhinged",10,"Perfect thriller movie","The movie is a typical psychological thriller which can hold audience till the end. No need to take popcorn because you won't get hungry."
"2781","Unhinged",1,"Horrible!","What a horrible movie. Almost 2 hours of my life I'm never getting. The plot is flat, simple and you can predict it from miles away. Other than that, it's the most unrealistic 'real' movie ever. Don't watch this."
"2782","Unhinged",7,"A suspenseful and nail biting 90 minutes","Russell Crowe is definitely Unhinged! Solid performances from Russell (The Man) and from main characters Caren Pistorious (Rachael) and Gabriel Bateman (Kyle). A nail biting and suspenseful 90 minutes. It's not original, it's a bit cliche, but you will not regret watching this film! It may even teach you some things about road rage! ;-)"
"2783","Unhinged",6,"A grisly thriller with Crowe doing his best big bad","At this moment in time we all find ourselves in, going to the movies is more than a mere novelty, its a genuine treat, so in that way we can be thankful for Unhinged that opened in Australian cinema's this week.Lathered in a hearty dose of Falling Down, a little bit of Duel and a lot of very angry Russell Crowe (more diabetic angry Kernel Sanders than Maximus), there's nothing new or even particularly great about Derrick Borte's grim thriller, but it does do exactly as what was promised in all the promotions for this grizzly affair, that sees Crowe go into full meltdown mode against Caren Pistorius's unsuspecting mother Rachel in a road rage incident that will make you think twice about beeping the horn next time you're on the road.Originally supposed to be the film that heralded in the return to cinema complexes in America at the start of July, Derrick Borte's topically examination of the rage that is bubbling away within society at this present time, whether its from hour long traffic jams, relationship breakdowns or the mistrust in the ""system"" is far from nuanced or balanced but this simplistic and over the top thriller does provide enough thrills and spills to keep us invested throughout and offers Crowe one of his funnest roles in years.Not often found playing the downright bad guy, Crowe is at his menacing best as the unnamed man haunting Rachel's day, that goes from bad to worse very quickly after running into him on the road on the way to the school drop off, from the moment we watch him commit a brazen act of violence in the films opening scene to the the mere look he gives through the window of a car, Crowe is chewing up the scenery at every chance he gets and it makes watching Unhinged a guilty good time.It must be noted that outside of being extremely far-fetched (as is often the case with such films) and playing out in a fashion that is typical of this sub-genre of thriller's, Unhinged is frequently unpleasant.There's barely a moment of respite from the horrors occurring throughout and if your blood pressure was high before going into a screening of the film it would go through the roof by the time the film is done with you, as while its well-staged and performed, there's an oppressive bleakness seeping through the entirety of Borte's film, making it one to watch when your up for such a grim and grimy affair.Final Say -Charged forward by a snarling and frightening Russell Crowe, Unhinged is a polished thriller that achieves exactly what it promises to do, nothing more and nothing less.3 Fortnite strategies out of 5"
"2784","Unhinged",8,"Most intensely violent enjoyable movie iv seen in a long time. Crowe is superb!","Had to leave a review for this movie, ok so its not the most mind bending story but for what it is wow! So Russell crowe is having a bad day and is very angry, he bumps into Rachel who is also having a bad day in a traffic jam. Crowe doesn't like the way she honks her horn at him and demands an apology to which she refuses so that makes him even more angry and he starts road raging to a point which turns him psycho, like i said not the most riveting storyline. But wow is this movie god damn intense! Crowe is superb as the very angry road rager who completely loses his head and decides to completely ruin rachels life. I had a lot of fun watching this movie, its violent its intense and crowe is very watchable as a maniac! The film doesn't drag at all its breakneck speed doesnt allow you to get a breath, just when you think crowe couldn't get any more psycho he takes it up a level again. Very good movie, severely underrated. Its a popcorn movie for sure so don't go in expecting a complex mind blowing thriller because its not. Its fun its fast its furious and its intense, strongly recommend to check it out"
"2785","Unhinged",4,"Too caught up in its own sensationalism to be taken seriously","Unhinged is a horror thriller film written by Carl Ellsworth and directed by Derrick Borte. Starring Russell Crowe in the lead role, it attempts to offer an analysis into problematic anger issues but becomes too caught up in its own sensationalism to be taken seriously.While out driving to drop her son off at school, single mother Rachel (Caren Pistorius) becomes involved in a verbal confrontation with Tom (Russell Crowe), a hot-headed, mentally unstable man who doesn't take kindly to being honked at by other motorists. When Rachel refuses to apologise for her alleged rudeness, Tom becomes determined to ensure that she understands what it is truly like to have a bad day, even if it means going through anyone else willing to help her.In practically all countries where there are cars, road rage is a prevalent problem and virtually anyone who drives can recount at least one instance where they have been associated with such aggression. ""Unhinged"" tries to show us that no one is safe from falling prey to this behaviour, whether they are the instigator, the victim, or both, in perhaps the most shamelessly hypocritical of ways. Essentially, the film is trying to condemn these violent actions while at the same time telling the audience that they should be entertained by it. This ruins any attempt at clever social commentary as it reduces the film to a mindless thriller involving an angry man and his grudge against a random woman. I'm not saying it was absolutely necessary for this to be an in-depth study of the actions of every driver on the road, but considering it is made clear by the filmmakers in the opening titles that rage is everywhere and something needs to be done, I'm not sure what other approach they could have been going for.The film's writer and director clearly have little to no idea of how to communicate their message over to the audience, rather opting for generic car chases and strong violence as a distraction. Sure, the odd vehicular onslaught and fist fight can make for a fleeting amount of tension but it doesn't matter if there's no solid foundation of a story behind it to back things up. There's only so much graphic brutality that can be shown against defenceless victims, in this case a meek woman and her child, before it turns into sickening torture porn. What should have been a clever study of how rage can cause each of the two lead characters to act violently is instead reduced to just one sadistic man taking out his misogynistic anger on an undeserving woman who happened to be in the wrong place at the wrong time.Russell Crowe plays his character with a frightening amount of realism, almost too close for comfort. A role like this fits the veteran actor like a glove as many will be aware that it's definitely no stretch for him to play such a short-tempered man, bringing to mind such incidents like in 2005 where he threw a phone at a New York hotel clerk or even his humorous parody on South Park titled ""Fightin' Around The World"" (I suppose this movie should be called ""Fightin' Around The Road"" instead?). That's not to say he's worth watching unfortunately, as he's just so one-dimensionally hateful in that his only purpose is to hunt down his victim and inflict as much pain on her as possible. On the other hand, Caren Pistorius plays her character like every cliched woman in a horror movie, frequently screaming and making stupid decisions that end up with her in even more trouble. It became difficult for me to cheer for someone who makes so many sloppy errors, to the point where I was shaking my head constantly every time she made a mistake. As a side note, I felt she looked way too young to be playing the mother of a teenage boy, either that or the actor playing her son was too old looking. At first, I thought the two were older sister and younger brother, but all that changed when he started referring to her as ""Mom"", much to my astonishment.Normally, I would have been happy to see a film that tackles a worldwide issue such as road rage as it can bring awareness to the masses of what could be done to combat it, but this one does it in such a hollow, mean-spirited way that all it did was leave a bad taste in my mouth. It's also a shame that an otherwise talented actor like Russell Crowe has been reduced to starring in a film like this as it does nothing to showcase any of his dramatic range that won him acclaim in the past. I'm still confused as to what kind of lesson we are supposed to take away from all this. Are we supposed to stop violence and anger with more violence and anger? If so, that's an incredibly stupid moral of the story.I rate it 3.5/10"
"2786","Unhinged",3,"A Few Loose Hinges","Looked forward to this thriller but it had so many improbable scenarios that I lost the thrill before it ended.

"2798","The Wolf of Wall Street",10,"Awesome movie, watched it multiple times","This film is every definition of the word ""impeccable."" Scorcese's fantastic storytelling ability mixed with phenomenal acting from DiCaprio, Hill and the rest of the cast makes for an awesome combination. The film is never boring and gives you a glimpse into the life of a man who had everything in the world only to have it taken away."
"2799","The Wolf of Wall Street",9,"""Money is the oxygen of capitalism and I wanna breathe more than any other human being alive.""","It's no surprise that Scorsese is associated with the gangster genre with films such as The Departed, Goodfellas and Casino, of which the last two are possibly the best pure examples of the genre. In Goodfellas the gangsters are dangerous but they operate on a more underground level, in Casino they practically run a major city and can do whatever they like. The gangsters were and will always be a part in America's system. Now, the gangsters are not just accepted by the system, but are considered to be an integral part of it. In the first two films, the gangster is threatening and dangerous, but avoidable. In The Wolf of Wall Street, he's calling to hustle you at home and you don't even know it. Some people view The Wolf of Wall Street as a glorification of Jordan Belfort's lifestyle and want to be like him, as Scorsese portrays this life by its nature, enticing. That's the way it works, and it's impossible to portray it accurately without showing how a charismatic man like Belfort can suck an unsuspecting person into a world of money and fame. The film though, shows us just how empty and destructive that life can be.There is an undeniable similarity between the instantaneous joy, energy and euphoria that we have while watching The Wolf of Wall Street and how Jordan Belfort lives his life, this is a movie where the director skillfully mixes form and content to create an experience which is as hyper and as instantly ecstatic as the life of its flashy and opportunistic characters.The direction by Martin Scorsese which still has infectious energy and power is impeccable, there is no other director who has mastered pacing like he has. This is a three-hour movie that moves lightning fast and always manages to keep the audience invested in the story throughout the whole duration. Each scene is packed with so much visual information, and it is fast paced and quickly edited, which complements the general tone of the film. The cinematography by Rodrigo Prieto is gorgeous as well and displays an optimal color palette throughout the whole film. Each shot also looks precise, even during some of the more chaotic scenes.The script is fantastic, filled with many great and memorable lines of dialogue. Every character has a well-defined arc and motives, and the story is given proper breathing room to blossom. The performances are also exquisite, especially Leonardo DiCaprio who gives one of the best performances of his career and portrays the opportunistic nature of Jordan Belfort's character with great commitment as you can see a lustful, hedonistic and impulsive sex & drug-addict man who only wants to have more fun. Supporting him with equal passion is Jonah Hill as Donnie Azoff, Belfort's sidekick, and even he manages to make a mark of his own. Margot Robbie plays Naomi, Belfort's second wife and she does an alluring job in her given role. Matthew McConaughey is in for a very short duration as Mark Hanna, Belfort's mentor, but even in that little time, he is the show-stealer and he dominates the screen unlike anyone else.Martin Scorsese and Terence Winter set out to create a film about the Wall Street excess, and by definition, it contains an excessive amount of everything, such as cursing, sex, nudity, drugs, alcohol and partying. But the film is not really about those things. The story of The Wolf of Wall Street boils down to money, that ""most-addictive drug"" Belfort speaks of, and not just what it can buy, but what it can do to people. Not just how it changes one's lifestyle but the effects it has on one's morals, beliefs, and values, and how it can effectively change not just how a person thinks and feels but how they operate at their core.With a collection of truly incredible films, The Wolf of Wall Street stands out as one of Scorsese's best films, my personal favorite and by far his most humorous film to date. He truly went all out and it paid off in a hilarious satire on the reverence of money, drugs, women, and the admiration of a criminal money-maker. The Wolf of Wall Street is maddening cinema that's already high on coke but still continues to snort more white powder every 5 minutes for 3 hours. This is a fascinating vignette of excess, greed, abuse and decay and it's one of the best movies of the decade and surely one of the most entertaining movies ever made."
"2800","The Wolf of Wall Street",NA,"High energy and wonderfully excessive as it delivers an engaging true story, but the lack of morality anywhere was a limiting factor","This film arrived in the UK with awards and Oscar nominations all around it, adding an expectation which it really didn't need adding since even without any of that it is ultimately a Scorsese film with a big name cast. It also arrives with some other stuff because the film has been criticized for near glamorization of the excesses that Belfort was able to experience with his ill-gotten funds and, to be honest, it is an impression that isn't helped when you consider that this film was put forward to the Golden Globes in the Musical/Comedy section. Now I am sure that was a political move by the studio, but it does say something about the film because indeed for most of it we have stuff so unbelievable and so excessive that it is hard not to laugh at it. It is hard not to enjoy it.And this is a problem, because the first 2 hours and a bit of this film is really engaging and enchanting in how much of a rush it gives you, how enticing it is and just how much vibrant energy it all has. The viewer is swept along and I guess to a point this is the film doing its job well because not only are we being told a story but we are first hand seeing how easy it is to get caught up in the grab for success, for money, for status. In this regard the film works really well because throughout the film I really was glad to be part of it and wanted it for myself; I don't think the film goes out of its way to glamorize this excess and this life, but for sure it doesn't do much to balance it  and this really is my problem with the film.The structure, subjects and delivery of this film is so inherently similar to Goodfellas that it is hard not to mention it. If you remember the opening of Goodfellas you'll remember that it opens with a memorably violent scene where an near-dead man in the back of a car is stabbed by Hill and his colleagues in a scene that is oppressive and violent but yet ends with the narration telling us ""as far back as I can remember I wanted to be a gangster"" and snaps to credits under a big track from Tony Bennett. This scene is important because it works as a microcosm of the whole film  the appeal but also the cost, all in one place. Wolf of Wall Street never has any of that and it hurts it. I suspect the message of the film is that our financial systems are screwed and that ultimately the rich will never be in the same world as the average person, because this is what I took from the rather sobering final scenes. However if this is the point it is trying to make then it really hurts itself with the rest of the film seeming to say ""so why not get on board"". I know this is not the case but the lack of a ""point"" or an agenda it the film means that it naturally fills it with its own, which is a weird feeling.But then again  I guess it is a comedy. So the infamous Quaalude scene is not horrific but rather hilarious, the scenes of excess and of criminality are not equally appealing and repulsive  they are almost totally appealing, we hardly get the other side or get to see a victim here, and a few seconds on the subway with the FBI agent really does nothing but yet again make the suggestion that ""it's all broken so why not at least get rich yourself"". Getting away from this, it is a well made film. Scorsese makes this award season's second film to owe a massive debt to Goodfellas (American Hustle being the other) and he directs the film with energy; music is used well as one would expect and the editing makes the film pop. DiCaprio is great in the lead  OK he doesn't find the heart of the character, but the film doesn't ask him to. Instead he is charismatic and energetic, drawing the viewer in and giving the film its energy. The supporting cast is deep with names and familiar faces and it is a statement about how well the film holds the viewer, because it isn't distracting no matter how many famous faces or supporting character from TV appear (although I did notice that this and American Hustle had lots of faces from HBO's Boardwalk Empire). Jonah Hill is over the top in a way that works, although I am surprised to see him getting an Oscar nomination for it in such a crowded year.Wolf of Wall Street has had a lot of praise and this will continue as the Oscars approach and are awarded. Personally I enjoyed the film as a funny true story delivered with energy and excess but in many ways it is not Goodfellas and the most important of these is that the film lacks a moral core to itself, to its characters and to its message. I don't mind the ""it's all screwed so who cares"" message that it ultimately seems to give, but I didn't feel comfortable with how wide a smile it had on its face while it was delivering it."
"2801","The Wolf of Wall Street",NA,"Where Human Flaws Make a Rotten Core","Brilliantly acted, superbly written and as one would expect from a picture by Martin Scorsese, it is a masterclass of directorial craft.Showy when it needs to be, but also quiet and contemplative. ""The Wolf of Wall Street"" is the equivalent of something like ""Good Fellas"" or even more so ""Casino"" but set in the world of finance. The suits might be more expensive but the people who wear them are just as sick and violent as their street-mob counterparts. Sardonic in humor and unflinching in showing the depravity of its characters, it marks somewhat of a different approach to the world of stock-trading than Oliver Stone's ""Wall Street"".Where Stone seems more in line with Bertold Brecht who considered theater (or in this case film) a moral institution, does Scorsese take the position of the omnipresent observer of the dark side of the American and in many cases the human dream.Leonard DiCaprio gives another stellar performance of great intensity and even greater tragedy while this tale of corruption, greed and self-righteousness unfolds.It's a vast panorama that shows how during the last twenty-five to thirty years gullibility as well as our innate greed make all of us accomplices in this never-ending pyramid scheme far away from any reality.One could almost hear Scorsese's clerical background come to the fore again, according to which nobody is without sin, and therefore we are all susceptible to corruption.It is our decision on which side we choose to live that makes the difference. For every individual but also society as a whole."
"2802","The Wolf of Wall Street",9,"The Wolf of Wall Street is Leonardo DiCaprio's Crowning Work","Martin Scorsese has done it again. His newest and most refreshing effort he's contributed to the world of cinema in years, The Wolf of Wall Street is a roaring thrill ride that is both absolutely hilarious and meticulously constructed. It also presents Academy Award nominee Leonardo DiCaprio in possibly his finest acting performance of his career. At one-minute shy of three hours, I was both engaged and hypnotized nearly the entire duration. A comedic epic that studies the behavior and cultures of a time in America, feels like the uncovering of a time capsule that was buried and dug up to give insight into our current financial crisis. Much more than just laughs, it turns on the dramatic elements early enough in the film to warrant considerable reactions about the choices of our key characters. Expertly paced with intelligent moral questions presented, The Wolf of Wall Street is one of the best films of the year.Telling the story of Jordan Belfort, a young Wall Street broker that gets involved in drugs, money, and even more drugs during the 80's and 90's. In his tenure trading (and stealing), Jordan marries, divorces, does drugs, marries again, does even more drugs, makes solid friendships, and believe it or not, does a lot more drugs. Watching the destruction of Jordan acted as a documentarian's insight that felt like I was watching ""Intervention"" without the family that cares. The Wolf of Wall Street is a black comedy, giving hints of drama. Natural comparisons will fly to Oliver Stone's Wall Street which is accurate but you can see subtle hints of films like Trading Places, Glengarry Glen Ross, and even American Psycho. That's a testament to Scorsese's outstanding direction and Terence Winter's masterful screenplay. Scorsese keeps Wolf life-size, sprinkled with characters that are both geniuses and morons, but functioning morons. They're like the frat pack group that sat in a corner on my college campus, being loud and obnoxious, and made terrible life choices that they still aren't aware of until this day. Scorsese puts together an all-star cast to inhabit these beings that includes DiCaprio, Jonah Hill, Margot Robbie, Matthew McConaughey, Jon Bernathal, and Kyle Chandler. All of which seem to be having the time of their lives.A lot of the credit of the film's overall success has to be awarded to Leonardo DiCaprio. I've never seen him truly ""go for it"" in a way that he exhibits as Jordan Belfort. In his breaking of the fourth wall, to his long but completely engaging monologues about life, money, and greed, it's the most assured and compelling work by the actor to date. When DiCaprio unleashed his talents in the mid-90's in What's Eating Gilbert Grape? and later stole the hearts of tween girls everywhere in Titanic, who knew this is the role he'd been gearing up to play. This is the role of his career and something that the Academy Awards should look to for his long overdue recognition. It's a charming and adventurous turn that presents a conundrum to the audience as we find ourselves both enamored and loathing the pure essence of Jordan. A sequence of DiCaprio crawling on the floor will probably be the scene of the year. This is DiCaprio's crowning achievement.As the magnetic and cheesy-minded right-hand man, Jonah Hill's performance as Donnie Azoff is another great turn for the 30-year-old actor. He's allowed to explore some of his comedic ticks and beats that he may not have ever had the opportunity to explore in films like Superbad or 21 Jump Street. In Wolf, he relies on his own instincts, and his chemistry with DiCaprio, which has helped him before for his Oscar-nominated work in Moneyball opposite Brad Pitt. Matthew McConaughey, is one scene shy of winning the Oscar for Best Supporting Actor. While his work in Dallas Buyers Club will bring him the acclaim and recognition that he deserves, The Wolf of Wall Street is a prime example of what he should be doing when he's not working or seeking out the strong, independent features that are geared for awards recognition. Stealing every frame and focus from DiCaprio in his ten minute screen time, McConaughey utilizes all his charm and spunk as Mark Hanna, the mentor to young Jordan as he started out.Like any great Scorsese film, the women are in full-force and given the opportunity to shine like the others. Cristin Millotti, a toned down and tragic version of Marisa Tomei in My Cousin Vinny, is sensational in her brief appearances on screen. Beautiful and sympathetic, she offers much needed serious and dramatic elements to Jordan's outrageous antics. In the end, a star is born in the gorgeous and vivacious Margot Robbie as Naomi Lapaglia, Jordan's second wife. Whoever was going to be cast as Naomi, had to be an actress of considerable talent and had the ability to really be the sexy kitten but still warrant an emotional reaction from the audience when called upon. Margot Robbie was the perfect choice and she'll need to owe Scorsese royalties for years to come with the roles she'll be offered following this. Robbie is pure magic and is everything she's required to be. She's the more elusive, compelling, and more thought out version of Scarlett Johansson's character in Don Jon.I loved every second of The Wolf of Wall Street. Terence Winter's script is a natural and well-oiled machine that produces the words of a demigod. You couldn't make these things up. Thelma Schoonmaker is the utmost professional and continues to shine film after film. You won't find another dedicated and glossed editing work this year. The other supporting actors do sensational work especially Kyle Chandler, who has a very well-constructed exchange on a boat with DiCaprio, has us asking more and more, why is this guy not helming his own films on a consistent basis yet?"
"2803","The Wolf of Wall Street",9,"Wolf of Wall Street review","If you've seen The Goodfellas or Casino, then you'll know the story of The Wolf of Wall Street. This is another tale of a criminal whose ambitions sweep him away into a debauched world of dirty money, out-of-control substance abuse, endless lies, a troubled family life, and a downward spiral of corruption that inevitably leads to his own undoing. Only thing is, this is less about the gangsters and mafia, and more about white-collar crime. The guys wear suits, work in proper offices, and everything they do is just business; funnily enough, this whole movie still plays out like a kind of gangster film.Based on the memoirs of Jordan Belfort - the real-life stock broker who made millions by selling shoddy stocks to average joes - the film showcases one seriously messed-up slimeball of a man. If his scheme sounds familiar, it's because it's been the inspiration behind the 2000 film Boiler Room, and this film covers much of the same concepts, albeit with better structure. The film maintains a close and intimate focus on the man as he rises to power, suckers thousands into his schemes, and then lives a life of extreme excess. And it is extreme: the whole film becomes laden with drugs, sex, superficial luxuries, material things, and characters who want nothing more than to take and consume everything. The sheer corruption becomes palpable on-screen, and I couldn't help but to shake my head at numerous scenes when I saw just how far these wolfish characters have gone in their unrestrained partying and debauchery. I have no clue as to how closely this film adapts the real-life events, but at times it's almost hard to believe that things could have gone this far. And yet, the excesses serve to underscore key themes and criticisms on the American dream; the pursuit of money and success, through any means, remains the main drive of the characters and the movie, and it leads to a fairly hard-hitting downfall.This film features good-looking photography and editing. Acting is great: Leonardo DiCaprio is practically perfect as the titular character, and the rest of the cast pulls their weight really well (including Jonah Hill, who seems to fit into his character's archetype very comfortably). Writing is really sharp and good; the film is full of great lines and great speeches. There are some great-looking sets, props, and costumes on display in this film. Music has a varied mix of songs, and they're all used really well for their intended effect.The Wolf of Wall Street is every bit as good as Martin Scorsese's previous work with The Goodfellas and Casino. All these films work with similar plots and themes, but TWOWS is like a gangster film masked by the thin veil of upper-class corporate swindling. It is a film that candidly shows the crimes and excesses in full, before proving that, even for the super-rich, crime still doesn't pay.Recommended! 4.5/5 (Entertainment: Good | Story: Very Good | Film: Perfect)"
"2804","The Wolf of Wall Street",9,"The funniest movie of 2013","""The Wolf of Wall Street"" is infectiously entertaining. It is probably the funniest movie I have seen all year with witty dialogue, over the top characters, and filled with energy that bleeds off the screen. Between all the fun however,  there is also a story about addiction and how it can cause a downward spiral in your life whether it be drugs, money, or power.Acclaimed director Martin Scorsese does a wonderful job keeping this movie at a high at all times. Never once does this movie lose it's energy or sense of humor much like the drug induced characters. There are a lot of quick cuts and edits to keep the movie feeling as If you are on drugs as well as playing high energy music in some of the more serious situations.The cast brings their ""A"" game. The stand out is obviously Leonardo DiCaprio, who pretty much owns and excels any scene he is in. This film really showcases his diverse range.Overall ""The Wolf of Wall Street"" is a full on adrenaline ride that never loses momentum. It's directed with a lot of flair and energy and has an incredibly well written script that gives it depth and a ton of laughs. The cast is fantastic and DiCaprio gives his best and most fun filled performance to date. I really enjoyed this movie and think it's the funniest movie of the year 4.5/5"
"2805","The Wolf of Wall Street",NA,"Scorsese's best pic since Goodfellas","The last few Scorsese pics left me a little disappointed. I had begun to think Marty had become a 'gun for hire' and that his brilliance may have been spent (his earlier works were some of the best movies ever made). I attended a screening of The Wolf of Wall Street this evening, and was expecting to be unimpressed. I am happy to say I was completely blown away. This pic is Marty at his best. I laughed, I cringed, I related (with fond memories as well as a bit of guilt) and I TOTALLY believed every unbelievable moment. A good book, a great screenplay and a delightful cast were formed and molded into what I believe should get Scorsese a best director Oscar, and likely a Best Picture Award for the movie. Leo DiCaprio has grown into a versatile actor and his creation of this super hero dirtbag's roller coaster ride in this crazy (true) story is really honest and delightfully entertaining. Jonah Hill pulled out all the stops too and this is definitely his best work. Thank you Mr. Scorsese for delivering the goods so brilliantly!"
"2806","The Wolf of Wall Street",10,"Must See! DiCaprio and Scorsese are Brilliant!!!","By far the Best Movie of the Year, Best Actor, Best Director! The whole supporting cast is excellent as well. This movie will not disappoint it was much better than I expected and the duration of the movie is not felt at all. It definitely did not feel like a 3 hour production. Scorsese put this movie together brilliantly! You are on your toes and engaged throughout from beginning to end. Leonardo DiCaprio is at his best! He will take you through the highs and lows of the movie with an Oscar Winning Performance. I read about Jordan Belfort and it appears that Scorsese and DiCaprio made this movie as accurate as possible which I really appreciate. I commend Scorsese and DiCaprio for keeping this epic picture as authentic as possible. After all this is Hollywood."
"2807","The Wolf of Wall Street",8,"Reserved for the male of the species","The Wolf Of Wall Street details the rise and fall in real life of one Jordan Belfort who for a while was living high and wide off of other people's money. It was good while it lasted until some relentless FBI agents took him down partly because of his own hubris.Leonardo DiCaprio as he did with such other real life figures like Howard Hughes and J. Edgar Hoover, each of who lived large in his own way with power, DiCaprio lives large with money. At first it's the realization of the American dream, DiCaprio the middle class kid wants to go on Wall Street. He goes, but then is one of thousands cast adrift by the stock market crash of the late Reagan years. DiCaprio is not about to give up his dream.He organizes his own brokerage house, similar to what is seen in the more modestly financed film The Boiler Room. But DiCaprio takes it far from a penny stock outfit. With a collection of his own ill assorted bunch of friends chief among them is Jonah Hill, these guys and I do mean it is reserved for the male of the species DiCaprio makes obscene amounts of money and spends it obscenely. That is sure to attract all kinds of law enforcement attention.I have seen very few films that have depicted the alpha male world so well. Women just do not compete in DiCaprio's world. All they serve as are sex objects. Women work on Wall Street in the more traditional brokerage houses, but not with him where being one of the boys is the first requirement. The world consists of 50% orgies and 50% piling up paper profits and later on hiding them from authorities. True of DiCaprio and true to a lesser extent of all his associates.Martin Scorsese directed this film and handled the film like he did one of his gangster epics like Goodfellas. The narration of the film is by DiCaprio and it takes you from his rise to where law enforcement has him between a rock and a hard place. Like Ray Liotta in Goodfellas a combination of drugs and hubris makes him think he's invulnerable. But in Goodfellas would not have had a scene where the wise guys just out and out dared to challenge the FBI as DiCaprio does with agent Kyle Chandler. It so reminded me of that famous incident from 1984 where presidential candidate Gary Hart dares reporters to follow him around to catch him doing anything outside his marriage. And of course they did.Five Oscar nominations went to The Wolf Of Wall Street, nominations for Best Picture, Best Director, Best Adapted Screenplay and nominations for DiCaprio and Jonah Hill as Best Actor and Best Supporting Actor. Hill was something of a revelation. The kind of nondescript character that you wouldn't look at twice, Hill gets taken to a world that he could only imagine in dreams wet or dry by DiCaprio. In his own Hill is almost as fascinating a story as DiCaprio.The guy who beat Leo out for Best Actor has a brief but telling role as a mentor of sorts. Matthew McConaughey plays a stockbroker who takes him under his wing and they have a great scene at a club where he's getting his first three martini lunch. McConaughey only forgets to teach DiCaprio one thing, discretion.I can understand why women would truly hate this film as they are nothing more than pawns in a male power game, but The Wolf Of Wall Street gives us a fascinating look at a man who tried to play with the big boys of the Stock Exchange and for a while, did."
"2808","The Wolf of Wall Street",NA,"Entertainment, not reality","Yes, Scorsese has always entertained us so well with abberant types, from mobsters to street criminals to boiler room stock brokers, all dealing death or financial destruction 24/7. But, do any of them bear even a faint resemblance to what really happened, and did those people actually behave that way? Regarding this film, I worked on Wall Street during that time, and even though we had heard of Jordan Belfort's firm, it was totally discounted as a boiler room and had no Street cred at all, just a terrible rep as sleazebag junk. It was no more than a side story to the real Wall Street, as those boiler room types were the lowest level of that era's greed-is-good WS slicksters.But, the movie.....could any human superman take the amount of drugs and unprotected sex shown in this story and even function, let alone at a high continuous level and not have a fatal heart attack? None that I have known or seen, and I have seen a lot. But, Dicaprio as Belfort was a marvelous choice for this outsized role, and he played it to the hilt as never before, with Jonah Hill as his sidekick comic relief, and Matthew Macconaughey a great choice for Belfort's oddball, probably whacked out(off?)mentor, and Bob DeNiro in a short mobster spot.It was such fast action that the 3 hours went by quickly, with not a dull moment in it. I enjoyed the fantasy ride that Disney could not have done better, but I could never get past the fact that it was 99% dramatized fiction, done to sell tickets(greed is good!) but not to enlighten us at all about the real Wall Street of that era."
"2809","The Wolf of Wall Street",8,"A Three-Hour Bacchanalia Caught on Film","Based on the true story of Jordan Belfort (Leonardo DiCaprio), from his rise to a wealthy stockbroker living the high life to his fall involving crime, corruption and the federal government.As of now (February 2014), this film sits at an impressive #57 on IMDb's list of greatest films of all time. Using that as a jumping off point for this review, we will have to scale it back a bit. Whether the film should be on the list is debatable, but certainly not within the top 100 -- it is neither that good nor among director Martin Scorsese's best work.Along the same lines, the Oscar nomination for Best Picture is a bit much. While there is no denying it was probably among the ten best films of 2013, with some incredible acting and more than adequate cinematography and editing, the very fact it has no chance of winning makes one question why even nominate the film at all. (Of course, without nine nominees, we would be back to having the reasonable number of five...) Scorsese received a best director nomination, and this strikes me as more understandable. He managed to assemble an impressive cast and tell a story that is both compelling and entertaining, without trying to put some moral tag on it. Whether or not the viewer thinks this is a glorification or denouncement of the acts depicted is up to them, as the film itself is blank (in the best way).While on the subject, could the drug use and sexuality have been toned down? Absolutely. And there is a good argument that they should have been (especially the non-stop sex, which comes across as gratuitous and only adds more minutes to this lengthy financial epic). Another argument says the events are extremely unlikely and exaggerated at times. And this is probably also true; but the film is accurate to the memoir, not reality, and this is Belfort telling his story with all the embellishments that come with it. If you want just the facts, read the court transcripts.Leonardo DiCaprio is nominated for best actor, and this is a choice that is understandable and yet hard to rally behind. He truly becomes Belfort, and probably makes the man out to be even more wild than he was. That deserves a nomination. But this is not DiCaprio's best role (he has also done a fine job portraying Howard Hughes and J. Edgar Hoover) and not one he deserves the win for.Jonah Hill, on the other hand, was amazing and deserves to win his supporting actor category. Being up again Jared Leto, he probably has no chance, but Hill has come a long way in a few short years from a lovable doofus in ""Superbad"" to a formidable actor in his own right. At first, ""Moneyball"" seemed to be an anomaly in Hil's career, but he showed the world he could do even better when he became Donny Azoff in this picture. Incredible.Whether Terence Winter deserves Best Adapted Screenplay for this film is unclear without having read the book. Such a nomination seems fair, though the win is hard to say without more familiarity. I am surprised no nominations came for cinematography or editing, which are strong in their subtlety. But oh well.Of the film's five nominations, it may walk away with one win (Winter) or two at most (DiCaprio). More likely it will walk away empty-handed. The film is not flawless (we could go on about how awkward the soundtrack was) and may or may not go on to be memorable for much more than its nudity and pervasive cursing."
"2810","The Wolf of Wall Street",NA,"Scorsese and DiCaprio Make Another Masterpiece","The Wolf of Wall Street (2013)**** (out of 4) Two word review: A Masterpice.Martin Scorsese's latest film is yet another brilliant one with Leonard DiCaprio turning in the greatest performance of his career as stockbroker Jordan Belfort who takes some rather bland people and turn them into one of the biggest scams that the FBI ever saw. THE WOLF OF WALL STREET is going to make many people unhappy and there are many more who are probably going to be offended by it but the perfection that is Scorsese was right when he decided to turn this into a comedy instead of a drama. Yeah, it's GOODFELLAS on speed and ramped up sex but it's just so brilliantly and wickedly funny that you can't help but laugh at all the craziness going on. Yes, there are some moral police out there who are going to object to a movie being made about a man who ripped off poor people but I'm sorry, I like the fact that this film doesn't really care about those people and instead just gives us an in-your-face look at these wild people, their wild drugs and their wild sex lives. This film is certainly over-the-top in regards to the excess but so were the characters so I thought they just went hand and hand with each other. Scorsese was the perfect person for this project because of his ramped up speed but here is goes all out and really delivers an incredibly wicked little ride that will have you smiling and laughing at some very questionable things.I've been a fan of DiCaprio long before he became famous and this here is without question the greatest performance he's given so far. I was curious to see how he would do playing someone crazy and wild like this but he does so perfectly and I'd say it was a flawless performance. No matter what was going on in this crazy life you believe that you're watching a real character and as his character says throughout the film, sell him something. Well, DiCaprio sells this performance and role like no one else could. The supporting players are just as wonderful with Jonah Hill, Margot Robbie, Rob Reiner, Jon Favreau, Matthew McConaughey and Jean Dujardin all delivering terrific performances. The cinematography, the music selections and everything else are just flawless here. THE WOLF OF WALL STREET could have been a complete disaster in so many ways but the strong screenplay and Scorsese's wicked direction makes it an incredibly entertaining film that works so well. It's hard to fully put into words what Scorsese and DiCaprio have pulled off but it's certainly one of the best and most memorable comedies in ages."
"2811","The Wolf of Wall Street",1,"soft porn flick","This was like watching a cheap soft porn flick. The drugs were glamorized as if they were harmless, like crack being smoked as if it had no more harm than a cigarette. The sex was like watching a cheap porn flick, with full frontal female nudity in several scenes and the sex scenes left little to the imagination. The only thing not shown in the sex scenes was penetration. But the sex, too, was careless sex, like whores who use condoms, unless you pay them more, which is what he claims to do and then another statements when he went nuts over a beautiful woman, that he does not care if he gets aids from her, he just wants sex with her. This movie was recklessly and carelessly done for the younger viewers."
"2812","The Wolf of Wall Street",8,"Goodfellas Meets Wall Street Meets Biting Black Comedy",""" The business of America is business "" screams an old cliché but like so many clichés it's based on reality . Is there much difference between a gangster and a stockbroker ? It's the sign of a very poor mobster who can't make a profit for his firm and it's the same with the stock market . Thankfully capitalism is legal and every other socio-economic alternative has been a disaster for humanity but one can't help equating the stock exchange with being the same as gangsterism , supply and demand without any moral or humanitarian mores and one wonders how American auteur Martin Scorsese might bring a story of Wall Street to screen ? If there's a problem with Scorsese he sometimes remakes the same type of film as in THE KING OF COMEDY and BRINGING OUT THE DEAD are remakes of TAXI DRIVER . likewise GOODFELLAS was remade as CASINO .One can't help thinking the temptation to make a story featuring an amoral capitalist could quite easily end up becoming a gangster film set in the world of high finance . "" All my life I wanted to be a white collar criminal "" In effect this is how the film works to a large degree but Scorsese is on top of his game so having such a large similarity on a narrative and visual level with GOODFELLAS and CASINO doesn't matter because for a movie lasting three hours it just flies by . Once again Scorsese uses the directorial technique of intensified continuity which is film critic speak for in your face direction . All the Scorsese hallmarks are here , breaking down the figurative fourth wall , garish and glossy cinematography , constant camera movement , pumping intrusive music etc etc . It's all here and you've seen it all before but it's so well done that none of this matters and remains totally compelling as once again the master director brings us Shakespearean tragedy in its most American and cinematic form To be fair to Jordan Belfort he didn't torture or kill anybody and his methods of gaining economic profit only differs from the rest of the finance sector in that they're illegal . Actually in amongst the excess of drugs , sex and foul language the storytelling doesn't make a very good job in telling the audience the difference between legal and illegal stockbroking but we're asked to take on board that Belfort isn't that bad because he's played by DiCaprio . Fair enough and he does a good job as a shallow and greedy boy who seduces stupid greedy people in handing over their cash . The rest of the cast also go along with the loud colourful style of the movie but was I puzzled by the one scene cameo by Mathew McConaughey in a pivotal role and kept expecting his character to make a reappearance at some point in the film which doesn't happen . . it'll be very ironic if as I expect McConaughey beats DiCaprio to the Oscar this year . A British audience might also find the casting of Joanna Lumley distracting in much the same way as Ray Winstone in THE DEPARTED , but the cinema audience I watched this with spent much of the running time laughing at the grotesque blackly comical scenes as they played out on screen . Mission accomplished Marty , although one can't help thinking an inclusion of a scene where Belfort passes a card warning a colleague about something is trying a little bit too hard to paint Belfort in a better light than he deserves . I mean it's not like anyone would be queuing up to listen to his lecture seminars after seeing this film is it now ? This is one of the better films from the long , prolific resume of Martin Scorsese , possibly his best since GOODFELLAS but one that will probably be very under rewarded at the prestigious award ceremonies due to one of the strongest film line ups seen in many years . It also won't convert anyone in to being a new found Scorsese fan but for those of us who's enjoyed his familiar language of cinema to tell a story about the American dream turning in to a nightmare it's proof once again that he's Hollywood's greatest living director."
"2813","The Wolf of Wall Street",1,"Horrible","Hi, I never write reviews here.. ever.However, I need to say something about how terrible this movie is.I told my wife one evening, ""Hey, there's a really high IMDb rated movie do you want to see it?"" She says yes.We literally get through maybe 30 minutes of the movie before turning to each other and saying, ""This is horrible."" and turning it off.The gratuitous nudity and debauchery seemed to be all encompassing, completely drowning out any semblance of a 'story' in this movie. It is literally a non-stop bombardment of softcore porn for the first 30 minutes..If you go to see this movie, keep that in mind. If you can get past the half hour mark before being bored with it, then maybe there's a movie in there somewhere.I don't think there is, though..."
"2814","The Wolf of Wall Street",1,"Do you want your money to support someone lower than pond scum?","***This movie may contain spoilers***Having been a Di Caprio and Scorsese fan for as long as I can remember I found the Wolf of Wall Street disappointing in every way. I can't believe that a Director and actor of such talent would want to make a movie celebrating the life of a complete low life (I can't say use the words I would like to) like Belfort. Think hard before you spend your hard earned on this because some of the money that you spend goes to a man that sent a wrecking ball through the lives of thousands and then rolled all the people who helped him do it so he could get a reduced sentence. I actually feel sick that I wasted my own money on it.If you want to spend 3 hours watching vacuous morons cheat, steal, lie, screw and celebrate that like they are conquering heroes then go ahead. There is nothing redeeming in the story, there is no mention of what happened to the people that were cheated, nothing to show that Belfort actually learned anything or changed in any way. It's just excess in every sense that goes on and on, 3 hours in fact.The title the Wolf of Wall Street says it all. Belfort sees himself as leader of the pack, rounding up the vulnerable and feasting on them whenever possible. Through this movie he's still feasting, on your money. Don't be fooled!"
"2815","The Wolf of Wall Street",NA,"The Dog of Wall Street","I found this movie to be tedious, boring and not all that well made. This nearly 3 hour movie should be CUT to about two hours. Things drag on without much of a conclusion. The characters are poorly cast (what does Jonah Hill bring to his role?) with no chemistry or spark to justify their success or motivation. Even the sex scenes and frequent nudity got boring {I can't believe I even said that!). The drug orgies are way too frequent and way too long.Leonardo is a good actor, but not a very compelling character here. He's not that believable as a salesman or druggy. Martin needs to hire an editor who has the courage to CUT, CUT, CUT and tell a story succinctly as possible. Overall, not a very satisfying movie to enjoy on Christmas day."
"2816","The Wolf of Wall Street",1,"Awful movie - borders on audience abuse","I really can't believe anyone likes this movie. It is an over-budgeted indulgence in offensive (intentionally, I think)...what I guess you would call ""soft porn""...that seems to have no point. The filmmakers seem to show the same contempt for the audience that the ""wolf"" shows to his clients. Throw a bunch of lewd, disgusting debauchery into EVERY frame, every scene, over and over again, and they will eat it up as if there was something there. But there is nothing there. There is no real story, no real character development, no real reason to watch these immoral characters indulge themselves. I truly felt traumatized, and with no that reason I could see. Unless you love porn, and senseless violence on every level, don't go see this movie. You deserve better."
"2817","The Wolf of Wall Street",1,"The glorification of a narcissistic sociopath","If you are looking to waste three hours of your life watching the glorification of a narcissistic, douche-bag sociopath who makes a hobby out of exploiting every aspect of business and the people in his life, this is the movie for you.Based on Jordan Belfort's life (the real life narcissist) this movie is misogyny, corruption, and exploitation on parade. There is no moral, just the showcasing of the worst humanity has to offer. To a man with no conscience, conning people and spending their money frivolously is the only joy life has to offer. Why anyone would want to make a movie showcasing such a disgusting, sad human condition is beyond me.My main issue with this movie was it's failure to show the repercussions of Belfort's actions on his victims. Real narcissists and sociopaths ruin the lives of their victims and often drive them to suicide. The Wolf of Wall Street negates the real affect of these toxic people in our lives, especially the ones at the top like Mr. Belfort, the ones who operate the top corporations and are literally conning our money out from under us.The seriousness of the damage Mr. Belfort is committing is eclipsed by the extravagance of naked women & one man, copious drugs (nothing innovative there), and money.The Wolf of Wall Street is the worst movie I have seen in over a year."
"2818","The Wolf of Wall Street",1,"Over acted, repetitive, every scene and the film itself too long","A group of us watched this film with high expectations, but by a third of the way through everybody seemed to be shuffling in their seats with the repetitive boredom of it all; but no-one daring to actually say out loud what they were thinking. It seemed to be an over indulgent love-in of quality actors overplaying everything, the director trying to show off how fast he could get the cast to talk over each other with irrelevant excruciatingly long conversations of no interest to anybody except presumably the writer; and every character a ridiculous overplayed cartoon cutout. Even the steadfast investigating cop had to become a wisecracking Caprio mark 2 when the pair finally got together for their ""showdown"". The movie ground on relentlessly with orgy and coke snorting scenes: OK, we've seen you can do that: please can we have some plot now and learn in much more detail how he got to the top and how he fell from grace? A waste of too much time."
"2819","The Wolf of Wall Street",3,"3 hours of jackasses behaving as jackasses","Not for an instant can I recommend going to this movie. It has a few hilarious moments and for that it gets a non-zero rating, but it is really too much to stomach 3 (three!) hours of dumb jackasses behaving like wild reckless dumb jackasses, like the world only exists to serve and reward them. And time and time again, confronted with the truth that some actions eventually have their harsh consequences, they fail to react rationally and don't ever get out when things get hot until their actions take them to the critical point of no return where they can't keep escaping the inevitable and everything falls apart. The story seems to me just as an excuse to depict all that stupidity. I don't know if many people will bear it, I really didn't. It was a relief to see the movie end."
"2820","The Wolf of Wall Street",1,"This was a horrible movie","This was one of the worst movies I have seen for a long time. Bloated, self indulgent, lacking in story line and plot. No idea why everyone seems to like it unless they just really enjoy watching men be totally disgusting for 3 hours because that is all there was to it. And I am a man who does not mind getting disgusting once in a while. I am no prude and not easily offended but this was like watching porn. Once you see the first orgasm in the first 10 minutes its 170 minutes of all the same after that.There was what could have been a moderately interesting subplot about a straight arrow FBI agent chasing the ""Wolf"" around which might have been slightly interesting in a seen that 10 times before way but it amounted to nothing.It is a bit disturbing how Scorcese glorifies the use of drugs, degrades women to nothing more then F@#$bags as they say in the movie, shows wife abuse and child abuse with no consequences and shows all the morally conscious people as ugly, dull boring individuals. You can say he is just telling a story, but he can tell any story he wanted to and decided to tell this one, so what does that say about him?A clear case of no one wants to say anything bad about a Scorcese movie. I really can't think of anything good to say about it."
"2821","The Wolf of Wall Street",1,"Thin drivel that says nothing meaningful about anything","Anyone who feels there is a shred of merit to this movie needs to take a second look at the emperorhe has no clothes. That an iconic director like Scorsese would fashion such a juvenile, indulgent and ultimately boring piece of trash like this is unimaginable. It's as if Shakespeare were to pen a couple of episodes of Gilligan's Island or Mozart to compose a jingle for Justin Bieber. That it was nominated in the Academy's Best Picture category to the exclusion of movies like The Butler or Inside Llewyn Davis is reprehensible. It's also pathetic that Mr. Scorsese seems to be following in the dirty old man-director footsteps of Stanley Kubrick (Eyes Wide Shut) by offering as much nudity and sex as possible for no apparent reason other than crass titillation. But that's not the biggest problem here. I don't have any problem with pictures that deal with sex or aberrant relationships or violence or excess as long as they're created with some artistry. I DO have a problem with pictures that are simply tedious. Shame on you, Mr. Scorsese."

"2823","The Wolf of Wall Street",2,"Save yourself 3 hours..... don't bother!","Painfully long - this could have been a 90minute movie with pace and precision - instead it was a 180minute nose bleed full of irrelevancy that should have been left on the cutting room floor.Really slack storytelling - key bits never explained or exposed and often rushed. Dull peripheral stuff laboured over for 20 minutes a time.Such an obvious plot - after the first 10 minutes you knew EXACTLY what was going to happen - and then it did and then finally you got to go home.This is a classic case of a A List actor and director being allowed to do just whatever they damn well wanted to do. They needed a really strong script editor and a real producer who wasn't going to put up with their prima donna nonsense. Overall a wasted opportunity - although Leonardo's performance was really pretty good which is where the 2 points come from."
"2824","The Wolf of Wall Street",2,"Utter Waste of Talent.","This has to be among the worst films I've seen featuring one of my all time favourite actors;DiCaprio. Whom all together gave a lack-lustre just plain boring performance. This film is simply a waste of time. It centres around a group of creeps led by upcoming wall street big-shot Jordan Belfort (DiCaprio). Who thrive conning white-collar's out of their money until the government catches on to their scams and the ploy inevitably crashes and burns. The main problem I had with this movie surprisingly was not its glorifying of terrible human behaviour, greed, drugs and full-throttle misogyny throughout (which I did have a problem with), but the fact that it was all pointless, and continuously depicts the the same crap over and over; something that gets very old. Very fast. It is possible to show debauchery and distasteful conduct in context and with a POINT (I', not some crazy who can't bear to see nudity or cringes at the sound of profanity). But this movie is deprived of anything close to a message or even a dialogue trying to give any form of meaning whatsoever. It seems to show these things just to shock or for cheap laughs (I didn't laugh. But had I they would've been incredibly cheap.). And that is what I have a problem with, the movie glorifying these things for what seems like no reason, or for a reason the makers failed miserably to get across, it just makes the film itself seem rampant, immature and stupid.Another huge problem with this film is the fact that it constantly barrages you with this debauchery brought about by DiCaprio and his cohorts, but never gives it any real substance, no blowback, no depth to it nothing (as I've already said) this in turn makes the characters look like exactly what everyone in this movie seems to be: immoral scum. None of the characters have any redeeming qualities whatsoever, they are all creepy greedy sexist pricks with nothing to show for. And this is where the movie falls ultimately flat. Its not a ""love to hate"" relationship between the characters and the viewer, it is a simple loathing of pretty much every cardboard cut-out in this terrible film, the writing is awful, almost seeming like they cut corners on purpose to avoid giving any characters or acts any depth or meat at all.Overall its an immature film that Hollywood will eat-up. Ridden with dick-jokes and the grade of humour that appeals to most teenage boys. Its not quite boring, but flatlines of anything memorable throughout. Maybe there was some sort of thought and effort originally put into this movie as shown by all the A-listers who appear. But all this movie offers is a waste of time, a waste of effort (if there were any), a waste of talent and a waste of money. Its simply not funny and will leave anyone above the average 7th grader maturity level feeling like they have to wash their hands for a couple minutes after watching."
"2825","The Wolf of Wall Street",2,"Not a good use of our time","While Leonardo is one talented actor and does an incredible job in this movie, the film could have been shortened to 2 hours to make its point. Stronger cautions of content should been out there. Pornography was clearly evident Several people left the theater and we thought about it midway through. Seemed like 2000 f-bombs versus the reported 500+ were voiced. We liked Leonardo way better in ""To Catch a Thief and ""Titanic"". People have mentioned a possible Oscar nod for Mr. DeCaprio for this, but my preference would be for him would to get it one day for a future body of work. Actually writing this review is not a good use of my time, so...stopping here."
"2826","The Wolf of Wall Street",1,"The best part of this movie is the reviews here on IMDb","Three hours of story and I had no reaction to any of the characters - no likes, no hates, no caring, no nothing.There is no comedy, no drama, no scary scenes, no thrills, no acting! It's just a bunch of name and no name actors running around thinking they are making one of those goofy frat college flicks.This episodic tale of Jordan Belfort wants to be so much of what it is not and that not is 'entertaining'. The plot line just goes in circles and we all know he's got to have his downfall - otherwise there is no story.And if there is a message hidden somewhere in this tale it's that you can't trust Wall Street - what a shock! Who knew?"
"2827","The Wolf of Wall Street",1,"Porn Movie","This movie should be rated x. Still impressed the American public is so desirous of porn and drugs use...and thinks it is funny. Congratulations to Scorsese for knowing his audience. Interesting to see so many people under 18 laughing at the drug abuse. IMDb requires 10 lines of text to issue this review, but really, how long was Scorsese's outline of this movie. I doubt it was that long. Let's see, show lots of naked bodies, throw in continuous offensive language, snort all the cocaine off the naked bodies, villanize stockbrokers...yep, that is a great formula for getting high ratings and making lots of money."
"2828","The Wolf of Wall Street",1,"Soul-Sucking Mind-Poison","DON'T PAY TO SEE THIS MOVIE. The film reminds me most of The Ring, but this time the demonic oppression is real. The unstoppable corrupter in this case reaches his spiny fingers through the silver screen and into your wallet. This is a true story and he (who doesn't deserve to be named) isn't done finding ways to cheat us. According to The Wall Street Journal, this guy is still laughing all the way to the bank, making a killing on book sales and movie royalties, while failing to pay full restitution to his victims. If you mistakenly see this film, like I did, you leave the theater an unwitting accomplice."
"2829","The Wolf of Wall Street",1,"Pick a Freakin' Genre!","I wanted to like this movie, I really did. Leonardo DiCaprio has been epic in his previous movies, and had done Gatsby so much wonderful credit from the book I couldn't help but to wonder if he himself was a fan. After King of Wallstreet, and the high reviews this movie had received, I was excited and I really, really wanted to like this movie. I walked away feeling as if I had wasted not just the price of a movie ticket, but a painful, excruciatingly long 180 minutes of my time that felt closer to 300 minutes.Not only did this movie utterly fail in knowing when to cut things off (there were multiple times in the movie I expected the next scene to conclude the story, only to be dragged through more scenes that weren't needed), but it couldn't seem to decide what it wanted to be. The humor is a wash between slapstick, big-lipped alligator moments, god-awful prejudice against an assortment of groups, with a bit of witty commentary on the ridiculousness of the stock market and what big suckers most buyers are. Just a bit though, after all, let's not take things too seriously since there's drug addiction, adultery, and idiocy galore! I had suspected that some fridge logic was involved in all this since there was just enough wit to keep me in my seat. I felt like despite the movie's horrendous length, maybe I had missed something in the storyline that would wrap everything up in such a way as to explain the high rating and reviews and that this would be brilliant. Well, weeks later, I'm still left feeling utterly at a lost at how this movie is still rated so high. I'm starting to think that the movie industry is beginning to be plagued by what I lovingly refer to as the ""Napolean Dynamite Desease"", where a movie falls so short of a delivery and yet is rated at such critical acclaim. Hell, at least Napolean Dynamite had some okay quotes to make up for its anticlimatical ending. Wolf of Wallstreet just left me feeling empty inside. The only saving grace was the bit of comedy that didn't go so deep into the utterly ridiculous that it was actually funny.If you want to waste your time and money on this excuse to throw midgets around, go right ahead. Give me King of Wallstreet any day of the week."
"2830","The Wolf of Wall Street",1,"Run away!","I went to this movie with a group of six other people. Six of the seven of us deeply wished we had not wasted our money on a really stupid woman hating movie. Anyone who tells you that the movie is criticizing the woman hating attitudes of the Wall Streeters in the movie is ignoring the fact that not a single woman in the movie gets to say anything with the slightest bit of intelligence or criticism of the attitudes of the men towards them which another filmmaker would have done to make women in the audience have at least someone to identify with and cheer on for even two minutes of this three hour self- indulgent crap."
"2831","The Wolf of Wall Street",2,"Scumbag fest","Over the top cursing, drug abuse, dirty talk, dirty act, lying, cheating people out of their money, homosexual and regular orgies, sexual masochism, public masturbation, drunkenness, over 700 profanities and blasphemy; adultery, child endangerment, reckless driving, incest, international money laundering, low level bribery, prostitution and occasional fleeting tender or dramatic moment. A scumbag's rise and fall and return to despicable life of greed, conceit and moral void. Scorsese and DiCaprio revel with the revelers in this flick to show...actually for an unknown reason. There is no moral reference point in the film, rather a neutral excitement about the cunning of the main character. There is not one good or sympathetic person depicted in this film. All are scumbags with no hope or desire for any form of redemption, remorse or a lasting human feeling. Very dark and depressing movie; actually misanthropic. The macabre disregard of any value is well hidden behind dark or foul humor and a blur of debauchery, crime and excessive luxury.The one thing that maybe deserves attention is the depiction of Belfort as a magnetic and captivating speaker, a preacher of mammon. He seemed to me more of a cult leader than a con man and a trader. Whoever made this movie hates man with a fiendish craftiness. Also evident in the very last scene."
"2832","The Wolf of Wall Street",1,"Disappointed","The beginning of this film appealed to the adolescent in me with the break the rules, crazy behavior of the wall street swindlers but soon it became so clear that this film was glorifying amoral, unrepentant thieves who stole millions of dollars from unsuspecting hard working people. They haven't paid back their victims and are now out of jail continuing to make money off of their illegal/amoral behavior. The acting was OK but hard to enjoy in the context of the real story and the thought that I was contributing to their wealth and probably boosting their pathological egos, not something I want to spend my money on. Mr Scorsese may have thought he was creating a social statement on Wall Street greed and crime but I had a hard time finding any value in sitting through this disappointing movie."
"2833","The Wolf of Wall Street",1,"Its like watching Hell for 3hrs!!! Never seen such a horrible movie in my life..","Extremely horrible movie with no motive other than making money by showing horrible content including sexuality, drugs and inhumane scenes, which has unfortunately become the fashion of today and is enjoyed by many.If a movie this horrible can gain such popularity it only means that human kind is asking for their own destruction, and I am afraid at this rate they will get it soon! One must think what base are they preparing for their future generations and I don't think they are doing a very good job by encouraging such kind of movies, where there is nothing good at all.My comments might seem a bit harsh but sadly its the truth."
"2834","The Wolf of Wall Street",NA,"god-awful","I admire myself for sitting through this piece of crap. I wish I had walked out. This movies is so bad it might be time for the director to hang em up. The constant depravity, the use of drug scenes where those taken would have killed a real person and boring meaningless sex scenes. I guess someone forgot the word Edit. Di caprio made himself a star idiot. I cared nothing about the characters my first requirement for any drama. no matter what. Using the f-bomb hundreds of times was disgusting and no substitute for good writing. The only reason I went was the Directors career of great movies and this one was so bad it almost destroyed his reputation or at least damaged it seriously. He should be ashamed of himself got putting out his vile disgusting film. Total garbage!!"
"2835","The Wolf of Wall Street",2,"The Dud on Lame Street","Some genius slapped Scorcese and Leonard DiCaprio together and knew that the world would love the turd baby, that is, The Wolf of Wall Street. Add some drugs, hookers and a narcissist (somehow they even screwed up the typical 'loveable asshole'- there is nothing likable or sympathetic about this character). 8.5/10? Really? Nothing stands out in this movie except for the fact that it is certainly verrry loooong winded and, wow, I don't think i could watch another character-narrated Martin Scorsese film without being reminded of the bitter stench of this stinker. The Wolf of Wall Street, my god. I liked Jonah Hill before. So dull. Poor acting. Unintelligent."
"2836","The Wolf of Wall Street",2,"Ideas have and will have consequences","t is with a long due that I am writing my opinion on ""The Wolf of Wall Street"". I first wanted to inquire a bit into the opinions of my friends, and check myself whether I am missing something. Seems that I did not. I approach the issue of Wolf of Wall Street (WWS) movie with the question what was the main point of the movie? When people do or create things, they usually aim to make a point, at least 95% of the cases, excluding those that are doing things just for the sake of it. Here we talk about a movie. Here are some of the possible points WWS (in this case its director Scorsese) tried to make, and whether the means he used to make the point, actually served its purpose. Even if one does not want to moralize the story and just watch, a couple of ideas yet are hinted.According to the last part of the movie we might propose that the point was to learn how to sell a pen- first create a demand. This is I think quite a cheap point for an excessively long movie, since it is lesson 101 in each economy class. I wonder why this was depicted with the deep look in Belfort's eyes by the end of the movie when he was holding a seminar. I would have understood it as the starting point of an interesting, challenging money game that unravels throughout the movie, but this was basically it! Just make people believe they need this particular product! But hold on, this came only after he experienced personality transformation, got terribly rich by fraud and enjoyed sex, drugs and money to its fullest. Yet he has a lesson for us.Second point might be that power corrupts. But did we really need to swallow all that nudity, promiscuity, and orgies to get this point? Many movies capture this perfectly by telling a story, describing a historical event, even great fiction, but not taping semi- porn.The legal system holes. Probably movies can present realities, hence raise awareness of the issues with legislation and its paradoxes, the flourishing of corruption, and the easily corruptible heart of men (as Lord of the Rings clearly and nicely depicts). But by the sheer snugger to these facts, this movie says rather go get them than go fix them! I also wonder whether the point was to bluntly present reality of Wall Street. Then this is kind of a descriptive argument, for which I think a documentary rather then a classical movie is required. Why watch 3 hours reality of Wall Street, instead of watching a good documentary with a warning of the contaminating content it contains.Good performance of DiCaprio? Yes, he is witty, courageously teaching us directly speaking to the camera, amusing us with the Lamborghini part performance<U+0085> but really, is there anyone who decided that this is this movie's take away lesson?Additionally to these murky points, this movie also puzzles its audience with absurdity rather then cleverness. Has anybody noticed how on earth the nice looking young boy, just married, with a fuse to go work, earn, build a carrier and future, just in a second turns into fraudulent, tainted mind?I also wonder whether the director at all cares about the audience of the movie. Probably not, but generally, young and ambitions people are drawn to watch the movie, learn some more about money making or find at least bits of explanations why the economic crisis happens. Of course many young boys come to see it since the trailer promises fun, young buddy enjoying girls, cars, and using his super intelligence to get rich. But I guess most thought this was simply the context of a grander narrative. Well no, this was it. And these young boys simply take away this message to be very cool!I am not demanding a light at the end of the tunnel (the movie), but I expect myself to finish watching the movie, and have either an ""aha"" moment, or at least a question mark. This time my question mark really regards the very sake of making the movie, not the content itself. In this case, the end of the tunnel was the transformed Wolf teaching people how to sell a pen. If only they knew how this little trick has broader implications for turning the business world around them upside down and build them a temple to worship their deceit! The motives but foremost the point of this movie are entirely dubious.Dear Hollywood and Scorsese, in today's culture, the last thing we needed was yet another glorification of greed- there is plenty of it, both in movies and reality. How about some counter action to the media, fashion magazines and shiny attractive starry skies of materialism? How about many many more movies on personalities that do not just grasp opportunity whatever the price, but act and strive for what is right? Even if the motive for the movie was simply depiction of Belfort's life, Scorsese and Belfort and whoever thinking the project was worthwhile, should also know that no matter how meaningless, ideas have and will have consequences. The movie sets lowers the bar of decency, and I wonder what will be coming up next out of Hollywood in this vein?"
"2837","The Wolf of Wall Street",2,"Scorsese's worst effort ever.","I would just like to say that I got absolutely nothing out of the viewing of The Wolf Of Wall Street. It is easily the worst effort ever from Martin Scorsese. The story line is almost non existent , DiCaprio is just a loser with a loud mouth, and all the surrounding characters are one dimensional. I don't see any moral battle being fought, I don't care about seeing hookers, lots of drugs being taken , or stupid parties, very boring. The real role model in the story cites his hero's as Gordon Gekko of Wall Street, Don Johnson of Miami Vice, and Richard Gere in Pretty Woman, what a completely shallow loser, even in todays bottom feeding America. The whole effort is simple B movie territory, not just because of the 80's and 90's settings. Couple this film with American Hustle, and you have a pretty awful state of 2014 film-making."
"2838","The Wolf of Wall Street",3,"Poor over the top performance by Dicaprio, boring overlong movie","So Dicaprio is nominated for an Oscar for his role here ? What rubbish, while his acting is about OK, he does carry his role over the top, he over acts in too many of his scenes, seemed unbelievable. Always over screaming, shouting out loud speeches with inflated neck veins that does not seem to look real or in context with the scene, I also did not like his performance in Great Gatsby, is he losing his touch ? The academy does not seem to think so! The same goes with Jonah Hill, ridiculous over the top acting made to be funny but ended up lame.The plot is nothing original, the rise and fall of a powerful man, have we not seen that so many times before ? Similar movies include Blow, Scarface and even the Spanish film starring Javier Bardem called Golden Balls. Overlong run time filled with lame rubbish over the top sex and drug scenes that seemed to take forever. I really cannot find anything good about this film, except a few laugh out loud scenes and a promising start that took a strong curve downwards as the movie progressed, 2 1/2 hours of torture.Still the movie gets Oscar nominations including best picture and best actor, what a disgrace!! Shame on you Academy !!Do not waste your money nor time on this."
"2839","The Wolf of Wall Street",3,"Total disappointment","The title of the film and its director were clearly enough to warrant seeing this one. But I was annoyed at how poor the acting was, and the incessant ultra-sharp close-ups of bad actors speaking mindless dialog made it too hard to watch more than the first half. While the storyline had a decent premise, its portrayal was shallow at best. There was almost no character development and no one you could identify with, which made it a bit better than a SNL skit. While the photography was good, it was put too bad use unless you like watching bimbos and greedy nerds frolic in cartoonish and gratuitous sex scenes.This wolf was a total dog. I'm not a great lover of Oliver Stone flicks, but his ""Wall Street"" puts this one to shame."
"2840","The Wolf of Wall Street",1,"Absolute Waste of Time and Pathetic Movie","I'm not sure what they are trying to do here, other then glamorize lecherousness. The movie has no original theme, and you can tell how the story will progress from the very beginning, indeed even just be looking at the title. I'm amazed at why this movie was presented for Oscar nomination. There is absolutely nothing interesting or original about it. It was a total waste of time watching it, especially because it is so damn long. I forwarded it most of the time. It also reflects on how powerless the American public has become that they can no longer steer what they are made to watch by the powerful media. I hope that the number of negative reviews will serve to put this movie back in its proper place."
"2841","The Wolf of Wall Street",1,"Don't be Conned into Seeing This","This film was so bad that it finally drove me to writing an IMDb review. Supposedly an expose of the criminal activities that lurk behind the facade of Wall Street, this film is nothing but a glorification of dishonesty, sex and drugs. Jordan Belfort's swindles are portrayed in depth as a manual for those who wish to be happy and gain a standing in life, while honest dealers are despised and ridiculed. There is nothing funny about this film. The reviewer who found it ""A comedic epic"" must have a poor sense of humour which finds a few gross jokes and the sight of a grown man pissing into a paper basket funny.The only epic thing about this film are the scenes of drug-taking and debauchery on the scale of Roman orgies which are made out to be an almost normal way of life. Had the foul language, sex and drug-taking not been so over the top, the film would have had much more credibility, but they were so gratuitous and repetitive that they became boring! How could Scorsese have stooped so low - is this all he could come up with to draw the viewers?Within the first half hour the pattern is set. By the end of the first hour we were bored and wondering when the film would come to the point but another hour of torture took us no where. 8/10ths of the film was spent drumming in the message that the only way to succeed and be happy in life is through sleaze. Finally the law catches up with the hero, but he sneaks on his friends and gets away with a smack on the wrist. The film lacks characterisation; all the characters are one-dimensional. I can't understand how Di Caprio could have been awarded a best actor award when his role was so one-sided - even when he was down, Jordan was totally unrepentant. Not a single victim is featured to show the effects of Jordan's fraud. Even the jail looks more like a hotel and the final scene shows Jordan re-inventing himself, as successful as ever with little price paid to society. Similarly, the script required little effort since 70% is a repetition of the same speeches in which the F word is every third word.The hypocrisy of this film is staggering. One would expect some sort of message from Scorsese but there is none other than the mind-numbing adulation of money and its trappings."
"2842","The Wolf of Wall Street",3,"I'm a BIG Scorsese fan, but...","There have been big Scorsese productions that I wasn't particularly fond of, like Gangs of New York and The Age of Innocence, but this is a first: a Scorsese picture I actually disliked. Nothing can change the fact that Martin Scorsese is one of the great American film auteurs. His body of work is virtually unparalleled. But this picture is a big misstep for the great director. It is a failed satire, if indeed it was meant to be a satire. It's overlong, overwrought, and ultimately boring. He means to show us something about wretched excess, I suppose, but he fails to create a single character about whom we might give a damn, except for the antagonist, and in the end all you can do is yawn and be happy it's over."
"2843","The Wolf of Wall Street",1,"DiCaprio & Scorcese scammed the public just like Jordan Belfort","Jordan Belfort scammed the public for MONEY, SEX & DRUGS! DiCaprio & Scorcese are no different !!! This movie was solely about making MONEY. It's filth, Smut and Pornography sold as ""art"" in the name of freedom of speech.No GREAT Actor/Director/Producer or Critic would sell their soul for MONEY, they don't have to..You have a voice. BOYCOTT DiCaprio & Scorcese and others like them! Show Hollywood, you have had enoughThis movie was an ""X"" not an ""R"" rating. Shame on those who rated this Movie1/3 of the people left the Lowes theater I went to. Some left in 15 minutes others 1/2 hour. I too left after I realized the foul language and scenes weren't going to stop. The lobby had quite a few people asking for their money back. From viewers reviews, it appears other theaters had similar results."
"2844","The Wolf of Wall Street",1,"DiCaprio has gone down in my estimation","In person DiCaprio paints himself as a caring environmentalist and humanitarian who is standing up against governments and co-operations. You get the sense the celebrities really do think they are amazing people who can change the world by using their popularity for good causes. How he has the nerve to do so whilst making his livelihood from glorifying a true story and making all of the actions of the lead character is beyond me. Ninety percent of this movie glorified the 1% who rip of the 99% and live shallow lives with no thoughts of the consequences for others in their actions.A shocking movie, showing the true values and priorities of Hollywood and Wall Street combined."
"2845","The Wolf of Wall Street",1,"When funny become cheesy and abusive","Before this film, I could start watching a DeCaprio flick without second thought and I would know that the movie is going to be brilliant; but this movie changed it all. Although, it has the element of entertainment; performances were good, direction good but had too much of crass element in it. A man who has no respect for law, no respect of people's feelings, no sensitivities toward anyone but himself and that man is being shown as a hero is just untoward. Never expected such lowly kind of film from brilliant artists like DeCaprio and Scorsese. Although, its doesn't matter to anyone, but I no longer feel like calling myself a DeCaprio fan. Way to go..."
"2846","The Wolf of Wall Street",3,"Good for adolescent boys, I guess.","I didn't like Wolf of Wall Street for a number of reasons. It was very repetitive and ultimately boring. How many times can one watch people snort coke, get drooly on Quaaludes, and have sex with prostitutes? How many smooth-skinned blondes with shaved privates are enough, and how many times do we have to watch mindless machismo and bonding? After the third or fourth scene of juvenile debauchery the excesses of the central characters become mind-numbingly dull. I recognized many attempts to inject a little of the magic of Goodfellas into the proceedings, which made me wish I was watching it instead of Wolf of Wall Street. Don't get me started on the film's attitude towards women (even aside from the aforementioned prostitutes.)The movie had a bit of humor, especially towards the end, but the characters were not developed and many chances to deepen the movie were missed. The movie came alive only in a few scenes, usually ones accompanied by music. It made me sad to see a director I admire making such a hash of it, and reputable actors trying valiantly to turn two dimensions into three."
"2847","The Wolf of Wall Street",7,"The Wolf of Hollywood!","I have two main points to say, first being Mr.DiCaprio has delivered a cracker of a performance. Second being Mr.Scorsese has made a farce out of movie which could have been something else.I once heard a joke that if there was a movie made on Mr.DiCaprio in which the actor playing him had actually won an Oscar for the performance it would be damn hilarious as Mr.DiCaprio can never earn one himself. This joke i think struck Mr.DiCaprio rather hard, as you can see the desperation in his performance in this movie. Of course he has delivered many a memorable performances in ""Inception"", ""The Beach"", ""Catch Me If You Can"" and ""The Man in the Iron Mask"". This movie is different, it is different for him very much as never has he been so bang on in creating a riotous comic scene with the true conviction of a actor. Some scenes in this movie have been written for Mr.DiCaprio and he fits into the shoes like a veteran with such ease that it amazes you.Mr.Hill complements him very well as the awkward homo erotic klutz who is a steadfast friend. The pleasant surprise was Mr. Kyle Chandler with a determined and charismatic role. Mr.McConaughey in a brief but important role was a added asset to the cast. Miss Margot Robbie was ever so gorgeous as all the leading ladies in Mr.Scorsese movies are.Mr.Scorsese has been strong in weaving tales which grip you like a ""f**king"" iron vice, he hasn't faltered in this one too. Who am i to be even be able to review the great Mr.Scorsese but all i can say is ""tut tut"", as this movie could have been made into classic but it seems to have been settled down for a entertaining farce of urban gimmicks like drugs, stupid men who swear a lot and lot of ""A"" rated scenes.Kudos to Mr.Terence Winter for writing a entertaining script with such plot points which you can expect before hand yet can't help but admire. Cinematography by Rodrigo Prieto is crisp yet rich.Nevertheless some scenes hit you like a concrete wall and you cannot help but cringe at the crudity of life as it is shoved onto your face."
"2848","The Wolf of Wall Street",1,"Very disappointed","Scorsese is my favorite director and I was really looking forward seeing his newest movie. The first half an hour was running very good. McConaughey was really great and his speech contained the whole truth as we all know it. BUT then began the colorful and crazy party full of ""fun"" and spending of money to sex and drugs. And this is it. I didn't get any more info or feeling about this movie. (of course if I don't count the FBI ""investigation"") I'm not saying it wasn't fun. A few scenes made me laugh as nothing for a long time before. But I waited for some point for some explanation. But nothing came out. I REALLY don't understand how Scorsese could even choose such theme. These people are idols of these days? Three hours to glorify such stupid and unmoral person is too much and the story was as much simple as it could be. I can tell the whole story in three sentences. I know the nudity could be very interesting for all men and boys but it was just TOO MUCH. It had no point and if I wanted to see so much sex I would see other type of movie. I was chocked by the age limit for this movie. Not for the nudity but because of the whole the message. Just have to have fun and spend the whole money for drugs and prostitutes the stupid ""normal"" people will pay it. And I don't know how would explain my young son that this is not the right way how to live and he will be happy once he get a good job and a good girl who will love him no matter what. Or this is not the way how it works now?"
"2849","The Wolf of Wall Street",8,"Hugely entertaining, if a little long","Martin Scorsese redoes Goodfellas in the financial sector. Leonardo DiCaprio plays Jordan Belfort, a young man immediately smitten with the ruthlessness of Wall Street (at first represented by Matthew McConaughey in a hilarious cameo). After the market sees a startling crash in the late '80s, DiCaprio gets pushed out of the big leagues. He quickly finds a way in smaller markets, pushing penny stocks. He figures out ways, not all of them strictly legal, to make cash hand over fist. Soon, paired with new best friend Jonah Hill, he opens his own firm. All the rules go out the door as he pulls in millions of dollars a year, which leads to all sorts of drug-fueled mayhem. The draw here is the pure debauchery. It will surely offend some, but the pure spectacle of depravity is enormously amusing. The film really doesn't want to think too hard about the awful things that Belfort is doing, which is kind of a bold choice. Sure, he does end up suffering in the end, but, with all he experienced beforehand, the little bit of suffering seems almost worth it. It could easily be argued that it's a hugely immoral film, but I think it just wants to put us in the action. The film has an epic runtime, which isn't really deserved. I wasn't exactly bored with it (though I was feeling it physically), but it could have been shortened. DiCaprio gives one of his best performances, but I was most amused by Hill. Many will despise his abrasive character, but I thought he was hilarious."
"2850","The Wolf of Wall Street",1,"waste of time (unless you are really looking for soft porn)","Waste of some good actors and 3 hours of my time. With this offering Scorcese has passed into complete and utter irrelevancy ... one can only hope it is temporary. The sheer amount of soft porn in this film is astounding. Does Scorcese think this is informative, necessary or pleasing? Apparently ... and one can only think this might be a personal preference he is indulging.DiCaprio once again shows how brilliant he is ... turning a complete disaster into something I didn't just walk out on. One continually thinks, throughout the entire 3 hours, that he is going to pull a rabbit out of the hat. He doesn't.Does this film have ANYTHING to recommend it? If you've ever wondered what it would be like to watch an overdrawn Charles Dickens story where greed, hookers and cocaine are the sole focus and the bad guys win ... this might be for you. Or if you like soft porn."
"2851","The Wolf of Wall Street",1,"This movie gave me a headache... Contains Spoilers","There are some movies you watch for escapism. There are some you watch for the storytelling.There are some you watch for the artistry and beauty. And then there are those that leave you thinking long after the credits have rolled because the message was so powerful. This movie was none of those. For me, this may well be the most disappointing movie of the 2014( and it is only 7 days old!!!)if not forever, now having usurped the similarly hyped ""Prometheus"" and ""Gravity""(but at least that movie was pretty). I found this movie to be 3 hours of nothing but a bunch of boys misbehaving and getting away with it - almost a ""Wall Street""/""Jackass Movie"" mashup. Excessive drugs, alcohol, sex and stupid people doing stupid things. And the swearing - so much swearing... I have no doubt that teenagers and men who haven't quite grown up will love this movie. They will giggle at the foul words and gratuitous nudity. They will covet the expensive toys, the suits and the pretty females. They may even aspire to be like Jordan Belfort - and that's where this movie falls down. As abhorrent as this life and lifestyle was - it is glamorised in this movie. Spoiler Alert!!!! It is NOT OK to rip people off; it is not OK to molest/rape women (wives included); nor is it OK to smack them around; it is not OK to drive under the influence of drugs and/or alcohol. And most importantly - it is not OK to act like an idiot even if you have more money than anyone else in your delusionally perceived stratosphere. I shall waste no more words on this movie except... Dire, just dire..."
"2852","The Wolf of Wall Street",1,"Loser movie made for the average loser","If you love prostitutes, drugs, scamming people and dehumanizing midgets then you might enjoy this film. Personally, I walked out because the lack of plot. For me, the story is as uninteresting as a Jerry Springer episode. What is the point of seeing a guy doing crack cocaine, having sex with a prostitutes or tossing a midget like a dart? Personally, I find these things to be uninteresting. If you take these type of events out of the movie then there really isn't a movie here. Of course, I realize that there is a market for Jerry Springer type material. With this being said, it is sad that people consume this type of entertainment because it shows that many people live incredibly boring lives."
"2853","The Wolf of Wall Street",2,"Crass and Vulgar","From the very first scenes, the film is embarrassingly crass and vulgar, setting new lows in cinematic tastes, and assaults the ears with a volume of swearwords that would not have been found on the stands of Millwall Fc. It astounds me that Martin Scores and Leonardo Di Carrie would allow themselves to be involved with such trash. The only reason for allotting 2 stars is the quality of colour, audio and scenography.I really looked forward to seeing an updated and improved Wall Street but ended up with 3 hours of torment. Save your time and money and do not encourage Hollywood to make such disgusting nonsense in future."
"2854","The Wolf of Wall Street",3,"Debauched, lewd, incoherent, frivolous, Scorcese cannibailzes ""Goodfellas"".","This movie motivated me to leave a review. A negative, scathing, ridiculing review. I cringed at the many awkward acting scenes between the main characters. The juvenile toilet humour used in the movie to illustrate the debasement of Jordan Belfort was boring and even nauseating at times. I found it odd that Scorcese chose to leave out Jordan Belforts Jewish background, as well as many of the main characters in the actual biography of Jordan Belfort. This undercuts much of the meaning and social commentary, not to mention irony ie. when the up and coming lords of the universe decide to call their company Stratton Oakmont' such a WASPY sounding name tee hee. such chutzpah. The scenes where Jordan Belfort talks to the camera is reminiscent of the scene from Goodfellas when 'Henry Hill played by Ray Liotta"" gets up out of the witness stand in court and starts talking to the camera. Many scenes during ""wolf of wall street"" made me feel ashamed for Scorcese because he shamelessly plagiarizes ''Goodfellas"". The trajectory of the movie is obvious and not surprising. I found this movie to be far beneath expectation. Di Caprio was alright in his efforts. Nothing special. But Matthew Mconaughey was absurd, Cringe worthy! (I was very uncomfortable watching Mconaugheys outlandish display of pounding his chest and humming a mantra. He just was not believable, his cadence was off. I definitely thought this movie could not have been any more gratuitous or glorifying of scumbags in society."
"2855","The Wolf of Wall Street",1,"Boring for adults, fun for teenagers","About 75% of the movie consist of sexual content and consumption of forbidden substances. When I went to see it, I hoped to see another ""Aviator"" or ""Catch me, if you can"". Unfortunately, this movie is not even close to any of mentioned masterpieces. The main character is an ordinary control freak, who is constantly anxious and tortured by the fear of losing control and tries to remedy that by sex, drugs and booze. Teenagers will be happy to watch something ""Hangoverish"" here, but for a responsible adult the main character would look despicable and offensive. If you are a teenager, you should see this movie for sure: you will catch a lols and fun. If you are a grownup man with a sense of responsibility, this may be plainly boring for you. And God forbid you from taking your wife to watch it together."
"2856","The Wolf of Wall Street",1,"The dream-life of the criminal and irresponsible","Jordan Belfort (played by Di Caprio) wants to make money as quickly as possible and decides to pursue the fast track by selling hot air, otherwise known as stock trading. He also likes getting high on drugs and prostitutes (sort of comes with the territory). Therefore, we are ""force-fed"" lots of orgies scenes, even if I got the point after the first one.There is also a sort of love story gone sour mixed into the decadent life-style, but it won't break anybody's hearts. In fact, hearts are the accessory nobody needs in this movie.I had read some reviews mentioning how OTT this was, but they were not even close to reality. Told in a manic and repetitive style, this is the lurid tale of a disgusting, greedy, criminal ass**le and his equally despicable, moronic friends. In other words, Scorsese did a re-take of Goodfellas, moving from the mafia environment to Wall Street. I suppose this is to prove that all men are equally corrupted and disgusting, regardless of the environment... which is a rather depressing view of society (regardless of the orgies).Half-way through, I started to feel nauseated by the overblown and endless sequence of shouted profanities, illegal deals and all sorts of wild parties, inclusive of one guy masturbating at the sight of Jordan soon-to-be second wife. Even if I know that the Academy's standards are very low, I was surprised to see that a movie with a guy jerking off was considered Oscar material.Final note: even my male companion got fed up one hour into this, to prove that not every man is actually like Scorsese is repeatedly showing us."
"2857","The Wolf of Wall Street",7,"sometimes hilarious","Jordan Belfort (Leonardo DiCaprio) is a regular guy from Long Island working at the ground level in a Wall Street firm where Mark Hanna (Matthew McConaughey) is the star broker. On the first day of him becoming a licensed stockbroker, the market crashes in Black Monday. His firm goes bankrupt and he's thrown into the streets. With the support of his wife Teresa (Cristin Milioti), he ends up working in a Long Island boiler room dealing in penny stocks. He starts his own firm gathering a group of questionable salesman like Donnie Azoff (Jonah Hill). He quickly rises gaining the attention of FBI Agent Patrick Denham (Kyle Chandler). It is a drug-filled, stripper-strutting, midget-throwing wild-partying office. Jordan has an affair with Naomi Lapaglia (Margot Robbie) and eventually even marrying her. However the high life doesn't last even with their own Swiss banker.This has some funny moments and sometimes even gut busting hilarity. I do have a small problem trying to enjoy this movie at the start. Jordan becomes essentially a con man. The joke is that they're having all this fun but I can never forget that the fun is done on everybody else's dime. The characters laugh while I cringe. About halfway through, I do get acclimatized and feel more at ease with the movie. There are some great scenes. The scene of Jordan rallying the troops for the Steve Madden IPO is amazing. Leo gives a full-out performance."
"2858","The Wolf of Wall Street",1,"The ""Wolf"" Preys on Its Viewers","We watched ""the Wolf of Wall Street"" yesterday and could hardly wait for it to come to an end. I would give it an ""L"" for lousy, and for being 3 hours worth of wasted time. The movie was superficial and the characters lacked depth. The ""critics"" who recommended it also deserve an ""L"". Jordan Belfort its main character might be likened to Martin Scorsese its director. The former swindles the investor out of his money and the latter cheats the viewer of his precious time.However, if you like pornography, the movie has scenes which are merely rated ""R"" but which deserve at least an ""X"". Furthermore, although lacking in quality, the movie at least has shock value. Apparently shock value is what is used as a substitute for depth. Those who wish to be ""cool"" will appreciate its appeal to the herd instinct (e.g., the taking of ""cool"" drugs which substitute ""highs"" for reality)."
"2859","The Wolf of Wall Street",3,"Unbearable","American hustle was great a movie for grownups unlike wolf of wall street yet I am kinda ticked of at Cristian Bale acting like Robert Deniro and Leonardo Dicaprio wanting to be the next Jack Nicholson. The wolf has some serious parts very few the rest is a mindless carnival of bull I am surprised how bad everything was even hated DiCaprio's performance for the first time he was phenomenal in Django I had big expectations for this movie it tries to take a stab at a lot of film styles but succeeds in none it is a shameful movie from great artist a I was disgusted walking out of the treater. i will have to watch the departed a few times to get this out of my system."
"2860","The Wolf of Wall Street",1,"Really?...","Prompted by the excellent reviews, we went to see this film. Well, it was one of the biggest disappointment in our lives, and it's only because we were in a group that we didn't leave the room after about 10 minutes (we should have, as the ordeal lasted about 3 hours).It's true we were very put off by the countless nude scenes and by the language with so many swear words they seem to be artificially added to reach some kind of perverted quota. In France, the movie is forbidden to children below 12, but I can't imagine a child of 12 watching this horror.But in addition to this awful packaging, we also found that the box was totally empty. The story is boring, the main characters are neither compelling heroes, nor interesting antiheroes, just ordinary losers that think they aren't because they are loaded with money. There is nothing to make us laugh (although there are a handful of pitiful attempts), nor to make us dream, nor to make us cry.Cry, well that was a close call though given how abysmal this film is. There are no ethics, no decency, no morals; it's just as if the director is ripping off the audience just like Belfort is ripping off his clients. Stay away at all cost!"
"2861","The Wolf of Wall Street",2,"Pure junk, just like what these guys sold!","How IMDb ends up rating this 8+ would make a better story than this piece of junk. Scorcese should be ashamed to release this trash. did this really run 3 hours? I wouldn't know because I kept walking way, then coming back, and the same crap was going on, different locale. Sex and drugs and money. Really, did we need that for 3 hours to get the point that these a-holes were low life scum that scammed millions and loved it? No. we didn't need that. I ended up ejecting it after I don't remember how many scenes of masturbation and peeing into waste baskets and similar ridiculous excuses for movie making. Scorcese - this movie sucked. The only reason I have it two stars was because the actors did a good job portraying their characters. But the director, screenplay writers, and the producers let this one get way out of control.Skip this piece of junk. It stinks!"
"2862","The Wolf of Wall Street",NA,"THE WOLF OF WALL STREET (Martin Scorsese, 2013) ***","Considering its many affiliations with American HUSTLE (noted in that film's review), it is interesting to watch how in the former, the F.B.I. emerged as foolhardy in their undeniably well-meaning approach  while here they are treated more or less as the heroes of the day when their operation proves a resounding success! Anyway, much has been said of this latest Martin Scorsese/Leonardo Di Caprio collaboration  especially in how it treads the line of tastelessness for much of its 3 hour duration (with some of the admittedly over-the-top sex'n'drugs antics seeming to belong more in a grindhouse or even ""Euro-Cult"" movie from the 1970s!). Still, I feel this backlash (especially for the way such serious offenses as depicted in the film are treated in blackly comic terms) was itself extreme: just note how much attention has been given to the dwarf-throwing gag (the pros and cons of such a wild scheme are amusingly delineated just like any other business-related item!) but, seeing how it occurs during the very opening scene, one would expect the viewer to have totally worked it out of his system by the time the picture's end credits start rolling! Indeed, to Scorsese's credit, if the Jordan Belfort gang's scamming of both poor and rich people was dealt with so thoroughly  or, should I say, the rewards they reaped from it  these characters' fall from grace is at least as detailed and spectacular; so, in that respect, it comes off as a balanced evaluation of a particular lifestyle which, like it or not, exists<U+0085>and to which gullible people themselves contribute in a misguided attempt to increase their own bank account without having to work for it!As for Di Caprio, his performance is indeed among the year's best and one of his own towering achievements  but, personally, I feel he was even better in THE AVIATOR (2004) and SHUTTER ISLAND (2010; for which he was not even Oscar-nominated!), both also for Scorsese. The film under review is up for just five Academy Awards, which rather shuts it out from winning any of the top categories  unless the AMPAS voters prefer the star to Matthew McConaughey in DALLAS BUYERS CLUB (another initially reprehensible real-life character dealing in illegal substances but, in his case, for the common good rather than self-gratification), which I sincerely doubt!; incidentally, McConaughey himself turns up here early on as the anti-hero's mentor and whose ritualistic hum to get him functioning on a daily basis is even worked into a song by the actor and the film's music director Robbie Robertson (ex-member of The Band and a Scorsese regular)! Jonah Hill as the protagonist's sidekick is also shortlisted in the Supporting Actor category but, while his contribution is highly entertaining, there is little depth to the part (even less so where their other colleagues are concerned, who somehow seem stuck in the lower rungs of the firm despite its obvious flourish!). Di Caprio's role  being based on the book written by Belfort himself  is clearly much more rounded, then, especially since his intermittent narration is adamant that money and power (even more so when acquired at a young age and unlawfully) too often lead one on a self-destructive path<U+0085>and the fact that he was able to rise again after 'doing time' is a testament to his talent for survival, if nothing else! To go back to its ties with American HUSTLE, the F.B.I. sequences necessarily recall those of Scorsese's earlier and superior GOODFELLAS (1990)  which suggests that its best (and funniest) moments tend to involve the after-effects of the copious intake of drugs, notably DiCaprio getting tongue-tied during a vital telephone call and his 'spastic' attempts to reach his luxurious car and drive back home. For the record, film director Rob Reiner appears as Di Caprio's colourful dad and Jean Dujardin is a Swiss Bank manager (to where the countless millions are literally transferred out of the federal authorities' reach). On a personal note, I should say that I was expecting to hate this going in but I have had to eat my words and admit that it was an enjoyable if (no pun intended) taxing ride...which, as soon as it was over, made me run to the medicine cabinet and pop a headache pill myself!"
"2863","The Wolf of Wall Street",1,"Great in conception but immoral in execution","Granted it is based on a true story that apparently was kept as close to reality as possible: the obscenity, the depravity, degradation of women (not just prostitutes but wives!!), greed and all the vices possible to males are there. The pace was fantastic but the tone of the movie was very much misguided. To a lot of people the whole depravity/greed point was missed because the tone of the movie was light and had almost no weight despite the gravity of what happens to the protagonist by the end. A lot of my friends (males) actually thought that going to prison for 3 years was nothing compared to the blissful obscene life of Jordan and were actually ready to give it a try if the opportunity presented itself. The point of a movie is above all to convey a message and a morale and I am afraid to say that despite my admiration for Dicaprio, the message of the movie was nothing but the opposite. The sad part is some people get blaze when they watch this movie and think all of this is normal and acceptable! For so much callousness, greed and evil, the movie should have had a more serious tone. The ending shows a well off Jordan who was not crumbled by losing his wife, almost killing his daughter, possibly having Aids or his skin peeling off from all the drugs he had and not at all ashamed of what he did. It shows a man strong who is invincible JUST because he knows how to sell and take opportunity of people's stupidity and need. And this is a bad message all throughout. The movie depicts how he had a blast in prison! They say the beginning and the end are the most important parts...which is where he shines the most!The movie (director's vision) might have been great in its conception but is just abhorrent in its execution. Such a movie does not deserve to be in the Oscar!"
"2864","The Wolf of Wall Street",8,"The Great Leonardo!","I have been using IMDb for years & have never posted a review but after seeing TWoWS I felt I needed to finally enter the domain of amateur critics.I've always been a fan of Scorsese's since I was young, some of most memorable cinematic moments come from his earlier works but for me, when he teams with Di Caprio, it's a match made in the highest reaches of movie-making heaven. 'The Departed' is undoubtedly one of the best crime thriller's to ever hit theater's with outstanding performances from multiple cast members but 'The Aviator' was the role that took Di Caprio to that next level, Scorsese provided him the stage to perform and carry the movie to what I feel will go down as one of the greatest artistic portrayals on film.Everyone did not share my love for 'Aviator' but it looks to be a different story altogether with TWoWS with the film already receiving fantastic reviews and praise despite the controversy about the extraordinary excess portrayed. For those who haven't seen it and are sitting on the fence due to the criticism remember one thing, this is a Scorsese movie and you are almost always certain to be a part of a truly visceral experience, Scorsese is used to pushing the boundaries of what is usually acceptable to a mainstream audience and this is no different.At 3 hours the film never feels overdrawn, the characters are fantastically written (which is attributed to Terrance Winter's screenplay) and some truly memorable performances (Jonah Hill and Matthew McConaughy are both excellent) but it is Leonardo Di Caprio's execution of one of the most sincere slime balls ever portrayed on film that you MUST watch this film for.The best achievement I attribute to it is that without him, for this movie to be ANY BIT as good as it has turned out, you would only be looking at a very select few actors in the business.Will he finally get an Oscar? That remains to be seen.."
"2865","The Wolf of Wall Street",1,"The Wolf of Wall Street","The Wolf of Wall Street, which is Martin Scorsese's new film based supposedly on a true story and book by Jordan Belfort, is not only the single worst film I have seen in 2013 so far, but it is also one of the worst films that I have ever had the misfortune of sitting through. The film sounded interesting enough as I have an interest in wall street and the business world and more times than not I have enjoyed Martin Scorsese's films and Leonardo DiCaprio as well as their collaborations together, but this film just did not work. First off, I think that this is one of the most vulgar and profane films that I have ever seen. I would actually be curious to know how many profanities were uttered during the course of this film because it must have been an awful lot because there was barely a minute that went by without someone cursing. Besides the filthy language and lots of it, the film showed the lifestyles these characters lived and showed in graphic detail all the immoral and perverse things that they were up to. Basically this was the whole of the film, showing a bunch of spoiled an arrogant rich people behaving badly with no real message, or anything to wrap the film up with. The film was just endless excess and then some. I have seen a lot of films over the years including some that have objectionable content of varying degrees and styles and usually unless it is done in a certain way, I do not let it bother me, but for The Wolf of Wall Street, it felt like there was no point to it and the whole objective of this film was to be loud, crude, rude and vulgar. To be honest I am shocked the film did not receive an NC-17 rating. I guess I was not the only person to have felt this way because people actually left during the screening I was in for this movie and I read that during an official screening of the film with cast and crew, someone actually went up to Scorsese and said ""Shame on you!"". I wish I could have said the same thing right to his face. This is the type of film that I absolutely hated so much that I wish my friend, who very kindly paid for the tickets for the movie, would have asked for his money back because this film was almost 3 hours of my life that I will never get back, 3 hours I could have spent doing something better, or seeing a much better film. I am personally really surprised at the high ratings the film is getting and also all the awards nominations as well. Did they see the same film I did? To me though, there was nothing that made this film special at all. Every single character was loathsome, so to say I admired the acting would be hard for me to say, seeing as I did not care about any of these characters and after awhile they got on my nerves and I just wanted the film to be over. The film's screenplay was just excessive bad behaviour and wild living with no moral, or point to it, other than just showing it and going as far as they can with the content and hoping that the audience has a wild and fun time with it, which I didn't. Also the film was way too long. At almost 3 hours in length sitting through this monotonous and vulgar bore was actually painful. I sat and squirmed in my seat and wished for better lighting in the theatre, so that I could check my watch to get a rough idea of when this piece of trash would be over. Alas, I sat patiently and this film would just not end. The editing was all over the place and there were scenes in this film that had no point of being in there and others just went on for way too long. The film is being classified as a comedy, but I do not think I laughed once. Often it's attempt at humour, or trying to make me laugh was just scenes that I found awkwardly executed and filmed and they looked clumsy and poorly done. The whole film felt like it was made during a college fraternity party and written and made after everybody had probably way too much to drink. This is certainly a major disgrace for Martin Scorsese, the man behind such classics as Taxi Driver and Raging Bull. I didn't think with all his talent that he could make a film this bad, but he proved me wrong. Unfortunately, people are going to go and see this film and probably kick a big kick out of it for all the wrong reasons. I will certainly throw a fit if this wins any major awards over much better and deserving films this year though. As it stands, The Wolf of Wall Street is a film that I hope to never see ever again in my whole life and it was a rare occasion where I saw a film where I wanted a complete refund from the theatre chain. The absolute worst film of 2013 and don't make the same mistake I did by paying, or sitting through it."
"2866","The Wolf of Wall Street",1,"This movie DEFINITELY should have been NC17","Leonardo and Jonah's acting was so overshadowed by the sever vulgarity of this film. I don't understand how it is possible that this film got the R rating and wasn't NC17??? I get that the director wanted to capture the essence of the ""true story"" but if he was going to be this graphic it should have been NC17 to give the audience some warning!!! We saw it before anyone I knew did so I had no idea how extremely vulgar it was. If u haven't seen it read IMDb's parent guide description and you'll Definitely know what you're in for. Just wish I had, then I would have passed on seeing this explicitly vulgar film. I'll definitely be reading the IMDb parent guides for all R rated films I see in the future since apparently Critics love XXX films masquerading as R rated"
"2867","The Wolf of Wall Street",9,"Wolf in a $2,000 suit","An old adage goes that if on a certain day, everyone in the world received a million dollars, by the end of the day, ten percent of the people would have all the money.""The Wolf of Wall Street"" pretty much shows how that could happen.Based on Jordan Belfort's book, this is a very entertaining movie - although probably not for those who lost their money. The film follows Belfort (Leonardo DiCaprio) from newbie stockbroker to head of Stratton Oakmont, the largest 'Over The Counter' stockbroking firm in the US.Along the way he has two marriages, acquires luxury homes and automobiles, a sea going yacht with a helicopter, a taste for wild office sex parties, which would put a Roman orgy to shame, and a huge drug habit. But even after the FBI steps in and everything unravels, the guy still can't help making money.The movie is loud, lewd and often hilarious; it doesn't have a boring minute.Matthew McConaughey gives a brief but telling performance as Mark Hanna who initiates Belfort into the darker side of Wall Street. He also introduces the tribal chest-thumping chant that becomes a motif throughout the film.Aussie Margot Robbie is hard to take your eyes off as Belfort's second wife, Naomi. She was also an amusing guest on talk shows when the movie was released where she told how she pulled off the Brooklyn accent, and kept the news about her nude scenes from her family for as long as possible.But this is Leonardo's movie. Although in his portrayal of Belfort, where there appears to be almost no moral or ethical boundaries, he keeps our sympathy because he can actually laugh at himself; it's a high energy performance, but with a light touch.In a way, the performance has echoes of the one he gave for Spielberg in ""Catch Me If You Can"". Despite the fact that both Jordan Belfort and Frank Abagnale Jr. break the law, their sheer audacity dazzles us. Also, both Spielberg and Scorsese have great comedic timing; they know how to deliver a punch line. If you were looking for a reason why this film works better than Scorsese's ""The Aviator"", which also starred Leonardo, it could simply be the latter film's lack of humour - Hughes was eccentric but he wasn't funny.Enjoyable as ""The Wolf of Wall Street"" is, at the end you can't help wondering if even half of it is true, how it is that with people like Belfort and his friends helping themselves to such over-sized slices of the pie, that the world's economy hasn't descended to the level it did in 1929. In a way, it's actually a very scary movie."
"2868","The Wolf of Wall Street",NA,"Don't Get It...","... boggles my mind why this crappy movie is hailed as such a work of art. It's a terrible movie. Virtually a work of pornography, really... Filth, drug use, irresponsible behavior and all of it a pack of lies. May be based on some true story somewhere, but it certainly doesn't mirror any semblance of reality anywhere.The acting... Yeah it's great when the script is crap and the actors just have to pretend to hump like rabbits and get high left, right and sideways. Doesn't take much acting skill to pull of a porno.Horrible waste of time movie! Something is definitely wrong in Hollywood when this type of crap is lauded as a great award worthy movie. Should be ashamed of themselves, honestly..."
"2869","The Wolf of Wall Street",5,"would have been enhanced by cutting 1.5 hrs of orgy/drugs","When you start checking the time while in the theater, you know the moving needs editing. In this case, a good hour and a half could have been easily edited of orgies and drugs without losing the effect of lots of orgies and drugs. Actually gets boring after a while, more orgies and drug taking. On top of that, nothing whatsoever new or original here. Just more. Maybe bigger (if bigger means more minutes on drugs and orgies).Lot of (soon boring) scenes of the brokerage firm employees all acting happy and nuts -- more editing would have helped.And did anyone else see a couple scenes where you envisioned Tom Cruise in the role rather than Leonardo?In all, boring, too long, uninspired. Waste of time and money."
"2870","The Wolf of Wall Street",1,"Why I walked out on ""Wolf of Wall Street""","I love Scorsese's films. Sure his films are violent, male oriented, but beautiful filmmaking. Yet I began to be bothered in ""The Departed"" by his repeated use of the f-word in the script. It was distracting from a great story, great acting. But ""Wolf"" was something else. An hour of relentless f-wording and brutal sexist behavior toward women was enough for me. I walked out. Mr. Scorsese you are starting (if not already) losing some of your best admirers by this. To me it reflects a screenwriter who thinks he needs to use explicit language to make a film about a bad guy interesting to audiences. Might I suggest you get your screenwriters together in one room and watch the entire series of ""Breaking Bad"" to see how to write a great script. No profanity. No sexist drivel. Just creative language for a great actor to speak and to build his bad ass character as someone we'll never forget."
"2871","The Wolf of Wall Street",2,"Better Choice in Genre","Can't understand why this movie is getting the acclaim that it is getting. Yes, there's many like me who found the three hours squirm-inducing,dull and much in need of an editing scissors. For a much better choice in the same subject matter, try ""Boiler Room"", better acting, better story, and much more disciplined direction and editing. Although it is contrary to my nature and even though I'm writing a review which is essentially saying that this movie is overlong, too wordy, repetitive, and should be edited down to remove all the superfluous fluff, I find myself repeating myself here even though my credibility as someone who appreciates conciseness is now in jeopardy."
"2872","The Wolf of Wall Street",5,"Excess Is Boring, Especially When It's Three Hours Long","Martin Scorsese at his undisciplined worst.""The Wolf of Wall Street"" is 90 minutes of glib satire stretched over an interminable 180 minute film. I get it, I get it -- the excess of the film itself matches the excess of the Wall Street world depicted in it. But excess, both as a subject matter and as a style, is boring after a while. The first hour or so of the film blows the roof off the joint, and I was sure I was experiencing a film that would go down as one of Scorsese's best. But as it went on and on, and Leonardo DiCaprio's performance became more and more histrionic, and the film made the same point over and over, I had that depressing feeling that comes when a movie you're really enjoying makes a wrong turn and becomes one you really dislike.""The Wolf of Wall Street"" is of course critic proof. Anyone who doesn't like it is instantly categorized by its fan boys as stodgy and unable to handle the subject matter, as if it's an impossibility that someone could dislike the film simply because they don't think it's any good. Whatever. It's an overblown mess, stupid when it's trying to be funny (the Quaalude scene, for example) and in desperate need of someone who had the balls to tell one of America's greatest directors that he was letting his material run away with itself.Grade: C"
"2873","The Wolf of Wall Street",5,"A punishing marathon of excess","Biographical or not, this never tried to avoid comparisons to ""Wall Street"" (simply cranked to eleven). Throw in some ""Goodfellas"" and ""Casino"", add a dash of DiCaprio's charm and that's ""The Wolf of Wall Street"" in a nutshell. I guess I don't really have anything bad to say about this movie - I mean it's Scorsese in the director's chair - but for all of the energy put into scenes of unrepentant debauchery, the movie only really feels alive during a late-hour FBI raid set to a ""Mrs. Robinson"" cover. And that moment happens all too close to the three-hour mark. I can't imagine sitting through this again."
"2874","The Wolf of Wall Street",6,"Capitalism","It's a very good movie, but the message of the movie is horrible: people who see it could think ""oh, it is very good being DiCaprio. Capitalism is good. Poor people is popr because they want"".
I don't want heros like DiCaprio in WallStreet. I want heros like Zorba, the Greek, Larey Durrell...
I am sorry for my english"
"2875","The Wolf of Wall Street",6,"The wolf of anything but Wall Street!","I was so excited about this movie when released, Scorsese and DiCaprio teaming up again, a story taking place in Wall Street, what else to expect. I don't know why but it took me two years to watch it. And I am kind of ""Gosh, it could have waited more"". The reason is it doesn't tell you anything from a financial standpoint. All we see is a greedy broker who suddenly makes lots of money, parties all the time, and too much sex, sex and sex. I think the name should be changed to ""Sodom and Gomorrah All Over Again"" or something like that. The story doesn't clearly tells how Jordan Belford (DiCaprio) gets rich and climbs to the highs in Wall Str. We know he and his friends sell penny stocks and lead the IPO of SM women shoes, and that's it. It is never told how the penny stock mechanism works, or what happens to the people that trust Belford, and moreover he starts being ""Robin Hood for himself and his colleagues"" but are the rich that fool, do they just give away their money? Similarly, all of a sudden we see him lose everything, FBI investigation, wiring, everything getting out of hand, no story telling whatsoever. Jonah Hill does a perfect job. DiCaprio too much, overacting again. The speeches he gives in the company, for me, are too emotional, it looks more like a cult religious ritual than an ordinary speech to employees. Maybe they are not ordinary, maybe it is that stealing other people's money needs that kind of encouragement. Lastly, I think, the name of Martin Scorsese makes us expect something great, and this movie does not fit and come anywhere close to that expectation. It seems to me that the fantasies of somebody was pictured."
"2876","The Wolf of Wall Street",1,"prude is not the problem","Supporters of this outright horrible movie miss the point. I can watch sex and nudity and violence, and can listen to cursing, but I can't tolerate pictures that are just outrageous. If I hadn't known that this is a Scorcese film, I would have thought it to be Oliver Stone, with total distortion of truth in business and the reality of doing business. Nobody can function daily with that much intake of alcohol and drugs. Plus normal people have problems with any story that gives the viewer absolutely no one to root or hope for. My rating is a reluctant 1 of 10!We watched this mess for one hour and gave up on it. The Dicaprio performance is laughable."
"2877","The Wolf of Wall Street",5,"Way too long","One of the rare occasions when a potentially great film becomes BAD courtesy of its running time. I have truly never experienced so much fluff in a movie before. And what's worse it was totally unnecessary because the material was there and it was more than enough. I can't even begin to praise the merits of The Wolf of Wall Street (it did have a few) because the redundant scenes and dialogue are too much to get over. It's sort of like trying to enjoy a fine steak while tofu is being forcibly stuffed down your throat. It's all ruined.All and all what a pity. It could have been the best movie of the year if only....."
"2878","The Wolf of Wall Street",1,"A study in ultimate crass vulgarity","This movie is so offensive, so filled with endless drug and sex fueled debauchery, so full of rot, squalor, and porn that I am almost loath to even spend time writing about it. There is virtually no conversation  simply hundreds of expletives that are connected with inconsequential words in a doomed attempt to fake dialog. And drugs-porn.Most of the shallow characters portrayed, show such a gargantuan lack of class that it leaves you breathless. A moneyed common lot that act on virtually every debased animalistic urge that their festered brains can come up with. And everybody is screaming at some point or another  one of noisiest (non-disaster) movies I have ever been tortured with. And drugs- porn. (Drugs are even snorted out of a woman's assh*le. So classy<U+0085> ) After this, what can possibly be the next level Mr Scorsese? Scenes of child rape? I really expected a bit more class from you. But hey, we are all in it for the money hey? It is our right. And it is your right to shove this rubbish down the audience's throat.As true as the sun rises in the morning, this excruciatingly-three-hour-long-stretch of bawdy, very noisy and lewd porn-vomit, can never be called art."
"2879","The Wolf of Wall Street",NA,"Way too long","This movie can be summarized as follows: DiCaprio is excellent; the movie is boring at its current 3 hours and needs to be cut to half its length. There's a thin story line running in the background which lightly covers the history of Stratton Oakmont (the boiler room stock brokerage firm). I came away feeling more like I'd watched an endless loop of the movie Hangover - sex/drugs/rockandroll. Here, there's maybe one hour of stuff that's worth watching and then literally 2 hours of nothing but snorting drugs, naked boobs, more naked boobs, and then more debauchery - no, I'm serious, NOTHING BUT that. Just to get my biases straight, I have no problem with naked bodies on screen (on the contrary!). But, it truly becomes boring when they stuff that much in your face. Really, what's the point?"
"2880","The Wolf of Wall Street",1,"I waste my time, money !!!","I do not know why they produce this movie ! No story, lots of disgusting sex scene, and 3 hours of your valuable time !!! I still can not imagine how people can give ranking of 10 for this movie !!! The trailer does not match with the content of that movie !! It seems the huge budget of some rich people can help to produce such awful, senseless movies. I wish I would never go to cinema for this movie and ruin my Sunday afternoon. Do not always trust on ranking, some of them (and unfortunately lots of them) are misleading . Martin Scorsese has to retired himself, stay at home and enjoy the rest of his life ! Do not donate your MONEY & TIME to him !!!"
"2881","The Wolf of Wall Street",6,"Excessive in style, lacking in substance","When the final cut spun in some back room, I wonder what Scorsese thought he had here, a comedy, a thriller, a drama. This movie has a little bit of everything, but the sum of its parts adds up to very little. Very little that we as movie goers have not already seen 100 times before and nothing that I necessarily needed to sit through 168 minutes to see again. The lack of a conscience, the drive to make money at all costs, these are things we all already associate with Wall Street. So when Leo takes his messed up principles and quickly turns his smooth talking ways into millions of dollars, the audience says to itself, OK, now what? How will the story turn dark, how will the greed and booze catch up to these guys, because it always does, right. Wrong. The plot here floats at the surface to allow the merry pranksters of Leo and Jonah Hill to basically do whatever it is they want throughout the entire movie. The parties and intoxication are normally something I love, its fun to watch people party and do drugs (at least for me). Here, the excess becomes tiresome, and that would be fine, if the film was intended to show the perils of excess. But that's not the intent, the negative effects of the drugs is touched upon, and as the plot slowly veers toward the end for our wild wall street bunch, the drugs naturally move the plot deeper down the rabbit hole, but its too much after awhile and thus the film becomes a caricature of itself. A comedic display of excess that the viewer may enjoy like an exaggerated drawing, but not something that has any staying power. Scorsese may have realized this, so the plot meanders through FBI investigations, ship wrecks off the coast of Italy and Swiss Bank fraud. Its the classic example of throwing too much at the window and hoping something sticks. I found the plot to be unnecessarily bloated, I found the story to be largely superficial, and I found the actual direction to not be nearly as good as Scorsese's past films. Leo and Jonah are fantastic, some of the bit actors are good, but there is no real story here. It's just a party with consequences that do not seem to bother the characters and therefore, never really create any tension in the narrative. Its an enjoyable film at best, a plodding, repetitive, shell of a movie at worst. You be the judge."
"2882","The Wolf of Wall Street",1,"Wolf On Wall Street- Most vulgar and distasteful movie.","As a 16 year old, I have never been so taken back and mortified by something as simple a movie. I went to see this movie last night with my mom, and even bought tickets online so we could beat the lines. The previews displayed a fun, maybe action filled, interesting movie, and Leonardo is one of my favorite actors, so we had to go. One of the first scenes in the movie shows Leo and a woman in bed, naked and using drugs. After seeing that scene I was a little hesitant on whether or not the rest of the movie was going to be better or not. Despite the vulgar and disturbing scenes we sat through hoping for a turn around. In between the unnecessary sex scenes, and promotion of drugs, Leo is a stock broker trying to make it big on Wall Street. The main point of this movie is the unrealistic promotion of drug use and the complete opposite of the truth in showing that drugs will not only benefit your life, but will give you the ability to make loads of money. In all of my years, I have never walked out of a movie, making The Wolf on Wall Street the first. Once I walked out I immediately realized that even though I looked away in most of the sex scenes, I should not have seen those images. Sitting through the movie was sad, and most of all extremely embarrassing. If you are a mom or a dad thinking that this movie is going to be a fun getaway for you and your child to enjoy together, it is NOT. DO NOT TAKE YOUR SON OR DAUGHTER TO SEE THIS. It is sad that children have the opportunity to see this movie, and have those images pressed into their minds. If you have any common sense do not see this movie."
"2883","The Wolf of Wall Street",3,"Way too long & just not very good.","This movie easily could've been edited down to about an hour and a half but even then it would've only been an average movie at best. There are some good individual performances by Jonah Hill, Rob Reiner & newcomer Margot Robbie. In fact, Robbie is so stunning to view at times, it is unnerving that this girl can really act as well.In the end however, there is not a single main character developed to the point of giving a damn about them. This coupled with the fact that the plot is extremely predictable and linear leaves this movie as a real bust. The scenes of excess go on way too long. We get it and we got it very early on. I kept waiting for a reason to care what happened to these characters and it never happens.For the life of me, I cannot understand the hype on this one. Yes, it's Scorsese, DiCaprio and Hill, but that shouldn't give them a pass to not entertain us with something other than gratuitous nudity, drug use & profanity. That's just too simple a formula to warrant this kind if critical praise."
"2884","The Wolf of Wall Street",NA,"thanks for ruining my Christmas IMDb","Took my whole family, children and grandparents to this movie based upon the excellent review from IMDb. Left after an hour and a half of nothing but drugs and debauchery. Worst movie I have ever seen, period. Nothing but Garbage. Had to apologize to my whole family. I was ashamed at myself for exposing my children to this level of sex and drug use. This movie will stop me from taking my family to the movies in the future. Ciniplex should be ashamed for showing this movie during the holiday season without lots more warning of how bad it is. It will be a long time till I go to the movies again myself. Would like my money back. Never will see another movie with leonardo decaprio in it.Garbage Garbage Garbage Garbage Garbage"
"2885","The Wolf of Wall Street",1,"Honest words about the movie","I expected a lot. Probably those of you, who new in the beginning that it was a biography had other expectations than me. But I really regret having spent three hours on this movie because actually nothing happens. The movie is filled with very well acted scenes but that is all. It seems like one action takes hours - the expected climax never comes. The pointed out actions are also meaningless for the development of the story - they are just pointed out because... ? maybe because they are obscene. But that is all the movie gives you: an obscene junk of something, where you wait for the tragedy to start. But at the end there is only well acting actors and a huge black hole of nothing."
"2886","The Wolf of Wall Street",1,"Misogynistic, Ableist, Racist, and apologist.","I'm going to come right out and say I did not finish the movie. The fact that the main characters are portrayed as people to be exalted is absolutely disgusting - especially given that the titular ""Wolf of Wallstreet"" robbed his own daughter repeatedly. Belfort left his teenaged daughters thousands of dollars in debt by laundering money in their names.I'm guessing that wasn't seen as important to the writers of this movie.The movie itself is a seizure-inducing parade of hyper-fetishized women, shameless drug use (which is heavily glorified, even within the context that these guys are bad people), ableist slurs (at one point a character says if they had a ""retarded"" child due to an incestuous relationship, they would just send it to an institution, and the movie opens with a ""midget-throwing"" contest).Even though the heroes of this story (as there was no possible way to interpret them as villains except for conscious disgust with the writers) are eventually caught, it is far overshadowed by the hours of cocaine-snorting whoring villain protagonists and the high life they appear to be leading.While I understand that movies with scantily-clad sex objects (as the women are reduced to for the purpose of this film) tend to rate highly at the box office (and apparently on IMDb), this film claims to take from real life.When a movie supposedly follows real events, I expect them to be real, not glamorized for the sake of saving a con-artist's reputation (which ought to be so befouled no amount of name changes or money could redeem).This movie is absolutely revolting and shame on anyone who reviewed it as otherwise."
"2887","The Wolf of Wall Street",1,"The pot calling the kettle black?","Hollywood liberals take their best swipe at Wall Street liberals. Still, the old saw applies: you have to be one to know one. Is there really a clean end of a turd called art? I am no prude, still this rendition of the depravity of Hollywood excesses, projected into the Wall Street excesses leaves one feeling violated. The audience laughed, because it was reviled to an extreme, so that the laugh was preferable to vomiting. Try as you will, you cannot roll in manure and come up clean. Most people recognize that depraved behavior in the end is destructive, to self and society. Why spend hours examining excrement? Is the critical merit ascribed by critics and users alike, that the movie is so repulsively done that it makes it art? By Hollywood standards, it seems so. The movie actually did what the characters did, it stole from viewers for its own excesses, to make money and achieve notoriety. They tried to portray filth without becoming filthy themselves. That's an illusion. How sad a commentary on an aging director, and a failing industry. Yet we the public eat ""it"" (this crap) up. What a sad commentary on us. This movie is beyond tragic."
"2888","The Wolf of Wall Street",1,"R rating ""Really!""","This movie is set in the 80's and is full of the worst of that decade; drugs, drugs, and more drugs, sex and greed. This should have been rated NC17 or X. Although, those ratings are never used today. No one under 17 should be admitted to this film. I have seen less sex in porn movies. The acting is top notch. Leo is at the top of his game BUT the excesses in this film made it difficult and uncomfortable to watch. There are a few scenes that are hilarious. But the whole premise that drugs are the way of life for this character is ridiculous. I have talked to other parents that made the mistake of taking their teenagers to this film only to say that they agreed this is not a movie for anyone other then adults. Wait for the DVD. Do not watch it with anyone other then adults!"
"2889","The Wolf of Wall Street",1,"Gangs of New York updated...","There was a real opportunity here to make a powerful statement as well as a highly entertaining film but it got completely thrown out by the director & author of the screenplay. Instead of a stinging indictment and/or satire of Americann greed & lust we get an over- the-top presentation of sex & drugs as male pre-pubescent fantasy. Everything the average 13 year-old imagines his future to be. Not surprising given that the director Martin Scorsese gives the majority of his films the same blockbuster treatment: everything short of singing & tap dancing. The only other director using a similar approach is Baz Luhrman. Interesting that Dicaprio starred in this movie & Gatsby in the same year, highly miscast in both. Casting him is understandable: he's likable & cute & popular with the mainstream movie-going public. Here he basically replicates his performance in Catch Me If You Can. I don't say he's a bad actor, just wrong for the part. Here he reminds me of Bob Hope in something like Monsieur Beaucaire: likable but clueless as to what makes the character he's playing tick. Years ago there was a TV series called Profit in which Adrian Pasdar perfectly depicted a similar character. Ah well, gotta go for the biggest-paying demographic, I guess."
"2890","The Wolf of Wall Street",1,"Didn't deserve any of the acclaim it got","This movie is comparable to a project x, or other teenage party flick. I am appalled that my generation, the generation of the future, considers this movie more deserving than the brilliant masterpiece, ""12 Years a Slave"". There are some films that can be riddled with profanity and still be great (case and point: ACTUAL Scorssese masterpieces such as ""Raging Bull"" and ""The Departed""), but that profanity isn't what's great about the movie as is the case with ""The Wolf of Wall Street"". This movie is filled with nudity and drug and alcohol use as are the popular movies with my acquaintances today, however, those movies don't deserve Best Picture nominations, and they don't receive them. Just because this movie is set against the backdrop of Wall Street corruption, doesn't mean it deserves anything. There are great movies about Wall Street, such as ""Wall Street"", but this movie is a sorry excuse for an Oscar nominee. As for the acting, DiCaprio and Hill have done much better. The best acting job of the year for DiCaprio was as Jay Gatsby in ""The Great Gatsby"", and although that film was plagued by many of the same problems as ""Wolf"" (too much partying and modernization) and was, much like ""Wolf"" bogged down by the societal need for action that has lead to a detriment of the art of film, DiCaprio gave a performance that was superior to Robert Redfords in the 1970s version. Mr Hill has showed us that he can make the transition to serious actor, as he did in "" Moneyball"", this performance is more comparable to his performances in ""This is the End"" and ""21 Jump Street"", as those are the same quality as this film. Altogether this film is just a stupid party promiscuity drug film set against a ""serious"" backdrop. Scorssese, DiCaprio, and Hill have all done MUCH better, and hopefully will do better in the future. Don't waste your time."
"2891","The Wolf of Wall Street",NA,"waste of time","Love porn as much as the next guy maybe more,but other than sex, plenty of it and drugs not a whole lot to this movie, Leonaro does do a terrific job as do a few others,but no much plot development especially for such a long movie! basically we got rich,cheated other people, laughed about it,do lots of drugs have sex,do lots more drugs, have more sex with pros,do more drugs have more sex and on and on with women everywhere we go,and repeat that for about two hours. Couple of memorable scenes .....sell me this pen .......scene with FBI on boat..country club scene....but I'd wait for the red-box $1 to see....send wife and kids out when watching"
"2892","The Wolf of Wall Street",1,"Terrible. 1 star.","This movie was so disappointing. And I'm usually a big a Scorcese and DiCaprio fan. After the first hour, the movie becomes a one-note song. And how many people in the audience actually know what a Quaalude is? The line about taking enough Quaalude to get a ""cerebral palsy"" high was totally inappropriate. It added absolutely nothing to the movie. It was in very bad taste and completely unnecessary. I cringed for any in the audience who had a family member with cerebral palsy. And after the first 30 minutes, the movie became very predictable. It just dragged on and on. Should have been edited down to about 90-110 minutes. Save your money, save your time."
"2893","The Wolf of Wall Street",4,"You have got to be kidding-what a mess","Quite an achievement to make a film as filled with sex and drugs as this one and this BORING. Yes, if you are 13 years old you will likely enjoy this flick because your parents probably don't want you to see it and it is ""forbidden fruit"", but there aren't many adults left in North America that haven't seen this exploitation garbage done a lot better countless times. As for the promised ""comedy"", this simply isn't funny at all-some were forcing laughs in the theatre I was in but EASTBOUND AND DOWN or SUNNY IN PHILADELPHIA it sure ain't. Major disappointment all around. How exactly is Jonah Hill in so many movies-the guy literally has no business in front of a camera at all. As for De Caprio's big ""Oscar"" performance-at no time at all during this film did I for even two seconds believe De Caprio as Jordan Belfort. Jeez."
"2894","The Wolf of Wall Street",2,"movie with a wrong name","It can have lot of display of nudity. It can show drug usage as if it gives lot of pleasure. It can use lot of foul language in the pretext that people use , and foul language in pressure or when they are in a high.but using the name of Wall St and Wolf makes one look for some details of intelligent or rather cunning manipulations of Wall St in some way, the main personality would have resorted to in a better manner, but the movie was more of all the former rather than any of the latter. I have looked at the name of the movie and then the reviews in IMDb and just by looking at these two went to the movie., but am proved wrong because the movie is not what the name suggests it to be ... i mean out of the 3 hrs in the movie less than 20% focuses on what the name suggests and hence i was disappointed."
"2895","The Wolf of Wall Street",1,"O Unlucky Moviegoer!","""...is sickening, utterly worthless, shameful trash. If it is not the worst film I have ever seen, that makes it all the more shameful: People with talent allowed themselves to participate in this travesty. Disgusted and unspeakably depressed, I walked out of the film..."" That's Roger Ebert on ""Caligula"", a man who rarely walked out of films. Put together by the publisher/pornographer Bob Guccione, the graphic and elaborate orgies in ""Caligula"" featured A-list talent: Malcolm McDowell, Peter O'Toole, John Gielgud, and Helen Mirren. One difference separating these two cinematic debaucheries - upon release everyone connected with the film disavowed it, and Gore Vidal, after seeing it, sued to have his name taken off it. (He wrote the original screenplay.) It seems everyone connected with ""The Wolf of Wall Street"" is standing proudly by it. Many better critiques of capitalism have been made about selling out. Just a few: ""The Devil's Advocate"", ""Glengarry Glen Ross"", ""The Boiler Room"", ""The Social Network', ""Wall Street"", ""Trading Places"", ""Risky Business"" and ""Blow"". And then there's the incomparable ""O Lucky Man!"" by Lindsay Anderson, another allegory about the pitfalls of capitalism. And oddly enough, it stars the star of ""Caligula"", Malcolm McDowell. And Helen Mirren too. Inspired by ""Candide"", McDowell's character, Mick Travis, experiences a moral revelation at the end. (As does Kevin Lomax in ""The Devil's Advocate"".) Jordan Belfort? No revelations of any sort, moral or otherwise. And no revelations for the audience as well. As Ebert wrote of ""Caligula"", shameful."
"2896","The Wolf of Wall Street",1,"One of the Worst Movies I've Ever Seen in 40 Years","8.2 Rating for this tripe? Wow, did the sheep get caught in the echo chamber and herd for this one! They heard, ""Oh Scorcese! Oh Leo DiCaprio! Oh Jonas Hill!"" and they all fell for it! Haha! Suckers! They got sucked into it just like Jordan Belforte sucked all his clients in! That's the only thing funny about this garbage.And please, don't try to pretentiously turn this movie into some kind of moral message, or some kind of hipster perspective on it because there is nothing deep, profound, or any message about it.Looking back on it, this is one of the most insulting films I've ever seen, and not because of the adult content at all, but because it was really a bad movie. The only part I even remember was DiCaprio high on Quaaludes and having a hard time crawling out of his car and up or down the stairs- that was actually funny to see, but that's it. Sure Robbie spreads her legs in the skirt, woopedy doo, nice meme for the vapid millennial generation.Everything else was pure garbage. And another thing: DiCaprio looks nothing like Belforte. Belforte has an alpha male suave about him when this was going on in real life, while DiCaprio is just playing DiCaprio, and I didn't believe for a minute he was capable of being in charge at that corporation. This whole thing is awful.If you want to see a more subtle and intellectual take on the very important topic, then just watch the far superior ""Boiler Room"" with Giovanni Rabese, Vin Diesel, and those guys from around 2000. It is much more intelligently made and still portrays all of the same material, but just with a little more realism and subtlety.It should be in the Bottom 100 worst movies ever made!1.5/10"
"2897","The Wolf of Wall Street",4,"As shallow and egocentric as its main character","I really can't wrap my mind around the rates given to this movie. Though I love Scorsese and Dicaprio's work with him there is just no reason to consider this movie more than a playful comedy. 3 hours of, in all honesty, nothing. No context, no punch not even that great of acting. There is really not a line to follow or any biographical data to grab on. It's just an endless display of ""funny"" (was it really?) scenes where the main characters display their excesses and appetite for luxury.By the second hour of Leo getting drugged I was completely fed up with it<U+0085>at least these kind of teen/party/drug funny movies are short and give no higher expectations<U+0085> I was really expecting more of Leo and especially more of Scorsese..."
"2898","Black Is King",1,"How many fakes","I was slightly interested in seeing what this was all about, but, seeing how 99.9 % of all the 10 star ratings are made from new accounts from July and this is the only movie they reviewed. If you need this many fake accounts to bump up artificially the star ratings, then it makes me wonder how good this is really. So i'll pass on this one , but it would be nice if there was a balance and checks system on IMDB instead of the whole 10 stars OMG this is the most amazing most perfect most life changing movie I have ever seen!!!!

I don't think this title is appropriate and it certainly doesn't help the state that the world is in. If we stand for equality and inclusion, why would the movie be named ""Black is King""? It's just as bad as if the movie would be called ""White/Asian/Native/Latino/Whatever is King"". What comes before ""is king"" doesn't really matter, it doesn't welcome all groups of people. I know that this movie is supposed to parallel The Lion King hence the choice of words but it really makes it sound like ""black is better"" in the way it's worded. A better and more fitting title could have been ""Beyoncé: The Black Queen/King"" or just ""The Black King"". The movie itself is decent enough for a glorified music video but it's the premise and the title that leaves a bad taste personally"

"2912","Black Is King",10,"Stunning visuals brought me to tears","This is breathtaking music to the ears and eyes. A representation of black beauty, diverse African culture and history. It is a shame that resentful and insecure people have voted this movie down without having seen it. She included people of all races, focusing on one specific race that needs a little more love and celebration. If you don't understand how important and monumental this movie was, I hope you will in the future. This one is for the history books!Directed by Beyoncé Knowles Carter and dedicated to her son Sir! I hope to see this movie at the Oscars."
"2913","Black Is King",1,"Self indulgent crap","Honestly people are actually giving this 10/10? Absolutely laughable! Take your head out of Beyoncé backside for just a second and realize that she has zero talent! Take out all the white hate and race baiting and see that Beyoncé can't act and to be honest never been a fan of singers doing the vocal gymnastics crap! Would have given 0/10 if I could! There are much better ways to waste your time than watching the wife of a convicted drug dealer...oh we should forgive him because it was a long time ago? Yes so was slavery! But apparently I'm to blame for that too?"
"2914","Black Is King",1,"Makes Cats look like movie of the year","No wonder Disney is going bankrupt. Calling this pretentious is an understatement. I really do think that Beyonce and Jay-Z consider themselves the King and Queen of black people. All they are trying to do is promote their music with other black singers. I get that the target audience is black people, but there is no way black people enjoy this crap, it's an unentertaining musical LOL."
"2915","Black Is King",1,"Here we go again","After everything that is happening in the world can't we just drop it. Some people just want to keep banging on about their race being better then the next. Black is King.. no it's not, Earth people are!"
"2916","Black Is King",2,"Not a movie","1.5 hour visual music video but not a movie. Weak parody of lion king. Good special effect and post production but so unprofessional and weak story. You might be able to hire and pay heaps of people to the job for you but you need experience and knowledge of writing, directing, production and movie to make a movie which has been not found in this visual video. Racism and overselling wrong information which has come from lack of knowledge or prejudice toward race. Overall can be called long visual merged music video, not even experimental as lemonade."
"2917","Black Is King",10,"Just what we needed!","This woman can do no wrong. She's such a creative artist. This film provides amazing visuals as well as an in-depth look into African/Black culture. This is for all people NOT just black people. Enjoyed this film in it's entirety. Thank you Beyonce and Disney!"
"2918","Black Is King",1,"Cheesy","Watched this to see what all the fuss was about. It's definitely not Beyoncé best piece of work, would not recommend wasting your time watching it."
"2919","Black Is King",1,"Garbage","More boring, uninspired, racial dividing trash that has been shoved in our faces for what feels like forever now. 90 minutes I won't be getting back. Stick to making filler music, Beyonce. Films are obviously not your strong suit."

"2921","Black Is King",1,"Not that impressive","A bunch of costume changes that's all it was. The entire album was all about Beyoncé. She has used black folks over and over again in an attempt to sell music. All Beyoncé does is throw on glittering outfits and calls it art."
"2922","Black Is King",10,"THANK YOU BEYONCÉ","Black is king was obviously created by people who see black as a synonym of strength, power and humanity. Seeing this much representation literally made me cry, thank you Beyoncé and every one who worked on this amazing project."
"2923","Solo: A Star Wars Story",7,"A non-hateful Star Wars fan who liked it","So I am of the generation who got to experience Star Wars feom the beginning. Standing in a crazy ling line, literally wrapped around the local theater back in 1977 as a kid. Totally unaware I was about to see a movie that would become my central interest for all my childhood, early teens and once again as an adult. And all these years later, able to share this fandom with my own son. 
I liked Solo. I wouldn't say it's my favorite but it was a fun ride and it evoked the feelings that I associate with Stat Wars. The world and characters felt right. It showed us some cool new things about life in that world, living under the Empire. The amazing cityscapes of Corellia... It felt similar to me to Rogue One. Modern filmmaking techniques yet convincingly evoking the vibes of the classic Star Wars world. 
Anyway, I just wanted to put in some positive review for this movie to contrast this strange wave of hate feom ""fans"" on here. I don't really understand it. I have liked something about every Star Wars movie there has been. Some are better than others. There are weaker moments in every one to be sure. But none are worth the irrational seeming hate some people are putting out there.
Solo is good and worth your time if you like Star Wars. Just one fan's opinion."
"2924","Solo: A Star Wars Story",9,"For anyone who feels discouraged by the reviews","For anyone who feels discouraged by the reviews, I tell you this: They're not complaining about the movie, they're complaining because they feel abused by a continous stream of movies from a beloved franchise. It seems ironic, I know, but having nothing for so long and suddenly watching different posters every six months, has to be confusing and bound to raise some eyebrows. 
However, we have to look at it as objectively and simple as possible: If you love movies, you want to watch as many movies as you can. And if you love Star Wars, you love to experience the Star Wars' story! So all of this backlash for having so much of the thing you love is simply a tantrum that I hate to see on so many of my fellow Star Wars' fans.This a very well made film that anyone can enjoy. Plot, acting, FX, Photography, Cast, etc. They did a great job with everything. Taking into account the enourmous pressure of making a film from such a historical franchise, I take my hat off for anyone who has the bravery to do this.So, go and watch it, not with skepticisim, but with that natural feeling of curiousity and love you have every time you sit at the movie theater. I promise, you'll be pleased."
"2925","Solo: A Star Wars Story",9,"A solid adventure movie","I'm a big Star Wars fan (watched Empire Strikes Back in the cinema when I was 8 years old) and I loved this movie. With Empire Strikes Back and Rogue One, my favorite in the series.As for the movie itself, my opinion is that it's a solid adventure movie, in the style of the great Indiana Jones movies, with lots of fun and intense action, witty dialogues, great humor and solid acting from all actors. Yes, Han must meet a certain Wookie, obtain a certain spaceship and meet a certain curly hair character to maintain coherence with past movies, but the ""necessary"" scenes, even if expected are still brilliantly developed. On top of these scenes, there are several surprising scenes that run the gamut of the best of what the Star Wars universe offers: chases, spacecraft battles, shootouts, aliens galore and lots lots of anti laws of physics split-second solutions.Still, my favorite take from this movie is that they finally managed to shoot an amazing movie that is far from the epic good-evil battles of previous Star Wars movies, and this is completely in tune with the Han Solo character (and, btw, I think Alden Ehrenreich is a perfect match for the role).In summary, if you think the movie is ""unnecessary"" and not needed, it will indeed disappoint you and I would advice you not to watch it, but if you go to watch it with a no-expectations open mind, I think you'll be greatly pleased and much entertained.(and my excuses for any English mistakes; my mother tongue is Spanish)"
"2926","Solo: A Star Wars Story",7,"Better than TheLast Jedi","Better than I feared it would be, Solo is a different type of star wars film, which I welcome. No lightsabres, no mention of the force, and no big climactic battle. 
 Alden Ehrenreich is passable as Solo,I found myself warming to him towards the end. Emilia Clarke is completely wooden and the most memorable thing about Woody Harrelson is his bad wig.
 Effects are excellent as you would expect, the set pieces (train heist, kessel run and the end fight with Paul Bettany are good. Only the middlesags because of Clarke's poor acting.
Worth a watch"
"2927","Solo: A Star Wars Story",8,"True to the saga","As expected, the film has been met with huge criticism, which in my opinion is wholly unjust and just another opportunity for so called 'star wars' fans to voice their disapproval for Disney. Solo is not the biggest and boldest SW feature by any stretch, but it is true to the original trilogy material without resorting to overly complicated plots, ropey CGI effects and forced comedy. It provides action , excitement, great dialogue, romance and a vast array of alien creatures (that were lacking in Rogue 1) and genuinely feels like a SW film, albeit with an interesting western inspired spin. Its Star Wars with everything we love about the saga. If you hate it.. perhaps its time you realised you might not be a SW fan after all."
"2928","Solo: A Star Wars Story",10,"Thoroughly enjoyed the movie","Good Origin story not just made up for fans, took my girlfriend to see it who has not seen any star wars films and she understood and enjoyed it. Defiantly a recommendation ( don't listen to the haters) and can't wait to the sequel for it."
"2929","Solo: A Star Wars Story",9,"Better than expected","A nice adventure in the Star Wars Universe. No more, no less.. I enjoyed most of the movie. The negativity on this page is disturbing.What did you guys expect from an Anthology film? Ehrenreich does a decent job,the story is at least ok and contains a nice surprise in the end."
"2930","Solo: A Star Wars Story",6,"Solo: A ""Skip This"" Story","Gone is the time when an aloof and mysterious character like Han Solo can stand on his own. When the pure imagination of fans opened up countless debates on how the Kessel run really went down, or how Hans eventually won the Millennium Falcon and eventually became a staple of his character. The hard truth is, fans and casual viewers already knew these milestones in Han's story happened and will happen, so the only thing that mattered about this movie was, how was it going to happen? For awhile, the magic of Star Wars was that of not knowing what to expect and getting to analyze an entire lived-in universe by yourself or with your friends throughout the years. With Solo, that magic is lost. You know you will be dealing with limited stakes since Solo and Chewie are pretty much okay and surely alive after this movie. You know that it will hit the basic story beats of how he becomes an outlaw, a rebel and eventually the iconic smuggler with a secret heart of gold we all know and love. You know he'll get the Falcon, you know he'll end up with Leia anyway. There's no mystery here, everyone knows the answer and we're all left with awkward suspicions about how things will play out.  Alden Ehrenreich does a, for the most part, fantastic job as Han Solo and he makes the role his own, probably one of the better parts of this movie. Lando (Donald Glover) and Chewie both get their moments, and also stand out in their roles. Beckett (Woody Harrelson) and Qi'ra (Emilia Clarke) weirdly fall flat as the new additions for Solo, aside from an obvious wisecracking droid to entertain us and give us some emotional moments, the two side characters that are meant to be the people that influence the title character are bland and uninteresting. Beckett seems to be just a ticket for Han to go follow him wherever he goes only to just ride backseat in the mission in the end. While Qi'ra plays the love interest of Han who we never get to know much about aside from pointless and explicit exposition. She also has a vague and messy arc that makes not just Han, but the audience confused as well. At one point, you're not sure where her allegiance lies, what her motivations are and what drives her to stick or stay away from Han.  Moreover, the story really doesn't aim to tell a properly structured narrative, instead it felt like a ""Han's Biggest Hits Montage"" all through out. Now this is not to say that it's hard and impossible to tell a proper movie about iconic persons/events we probably know about and/or have learned about and theorized ourselves. Rogue One (2016) was able to do it to an admittedly better extent, and quite masterfully in the James Bond reboot with Casino Royale back in 2006. To use Casino Royale as an example, it's a perfect story that shows how James Bond became THE James Bond we know and love, the commanding, suave and rough 007 agent. When the movie starts, he's not yet quite the Bond we're used to know yet, but what happens in that film contributes to why he changes. Then in the end, that's the only time we get the iconic line of James Bond introducing himself because that character has earned it through the context of the film. 
 While Solo tried to achieve this same level of success, it falls hard on its knees really hard in the process. The definition of ""context"" the filmmakers had in mind with Solo was just throwing in fan service after fan service of what made Han Solo iconic, but we never really see why THIS character in THIS film in particular earned that iconic status. Han is basically the same person from the beginning till the end, compare this to James Bond in Casino Royale wherein his relationship with Vesper and how it ended changed his character forever, inevitably giving strong emotional and narrative context as to why he became how he is. This is never explored in the film and it instead becomes a by-the-numbers, monotone, and dull looking film.Verdict: 6/10"
"2931","Solo: A Star Wars Story",8,"A Fun Sci-Fi Heist Flick When Viewed Independently From the Star Wars Saga","Solo: A Star Wars Story boasts one of the more inventive plots I've seen lately. They play with Han's story and aren't afraid to take it some unexpected directions (at least for those just familiar with the movies and haven't researched to extended continuity of the franchise). One of the small problems I had with Solo was while the movie does have some intriguing ideas and exciting sequences, they reside in the middle of the movie. The bookends of this movie (beginning and end) are the weakest with all the best stuff in middle hour and a half. This isn't a major flaw, but I had to be patient for it to get going and the finale felt a little rushed.After the news of Alden Ehrenreich needing some extra help to get the character of Han Solo, I wasn't sure he could capably perform in the lead. He caught me completely off guard, he was great as Han Solo. He's not Harrison Ford (and no one could have matched him as Han), but he has the charisma, the toughness and the comic timing and I think he pulled it off. He bounces off Joonas Suotamo (who plays Chewbacca) well and I thought he also had good chemistry with Emilia Clarke who played his love interest Qi'ra. Clarke did well, her performance as Daenerys is still better but this was a step in the right direction. She's had trouble getting off the ground when it comes to acting in movies and this will hopefully be that stepping stone for her. Donald Glover does a fine Lando impression, there was a lot of praise for his version of this character and I largely share those sentiments. Woody Harrelson is solid as Beckett, he's appropriately slimy but he invites you in enough that you want to believe in him. Thandie Newton is good for the limited time we get to spend with her. I also liked Paul Bettany, but he was kneecapped by his character.I would put this in the heist movie genre but there are a couple of big action set pieces. Despite the troubled production, they were actually pretty great. Between the fight on the train and the escape/heist from the spice mining planet are both excellent. I didn't have a problem with the ending fight for the action choreography and even that bit had its moments. They pack the thrills and there were some unexpected outcomes for that little extra payoff. If anything, Solo proves you don't have to have a lightsabre duel to keep audiences on the edge of their seat.My problems with Solo: A Star Wars Story boil down to 2 things. The first is that Bettany's character of Dryden Vos is a weak villain and although the ending boasts a couple of unique twists, its undercut by the lack of a real threat. Bettany's a great actor and they gave him a decent backstory, but a surprise betrayal comes in the 3rd act and instead of getting 2 sinister threats, we end up with none. The second is that Solo feels somewhat clunky or as if the movie is being too obvious when it brings in iconic items for Han or connects to the larger Star Wars universe. Solo works best when it operates as its own story, the seams only start to show when you really examine how it fits in the original timeline or when characters from other movies cameo.I expected very little from this movie. I already mentioned all the bad press the movie got and while I went into this movie open-minded, the negativity surrounding Solo did lower my expectations accordingly. While it's far from perfect, I had a lot of fun with this movie. Between the taught pace, the solid acting from the cast and the infectiously happy vibe the movie boasts, I was swept up in it. It doesn't nail every aspect, but it gets far more right than it doesn't and I'm not going to drop it down to a 4 or a 5 because of some nitpicks. My actual rating for Solo: A Star Wars Story is somewhere between an 8-9/10 but I'll go with an 8/10 to be safe."
"2932","Solo: A Star Wars Story",10,"Very enjoyable, why so negative everybody?","Wow, some people are never pleased. This movie was enjoyable to the very end. How can anyone who is remotely interested in Star Wars not enjoy can entire movie dedicated to Han and Chewy??? And this wasn't a cheap production either. The best part is Disney kept their political agenda relatively at bay with this film, unlike the main saga films. So refreshing and rare these days. HAN IS THE MAN!! (and Chewy)"
"2933","Solo: A Star Wars Story",6,"whats happening to star wars ?","It's an entertaining film with out the soul of star wars. i don't feel han solo is there, just an action movie full with clichés."
"2934","Solo: A Star Wars Story",3,"Boring","They call it Star Wars but it a boring train heist movie!Why make it if it is so boring and stupid?You have never seen a scene as soulless and emotionless as when Han meets Chewie."
"2935","Solo: A Star Wars Story",3,"Star Wars And Disney","Fire And IceCat And DogEntertainment and juvenile trash"
"2936","Solo: A Star Wars Story",6,"Spoiler Alert: This is a cash grab.","Oh dear!! Never has a franchise been so abused for such a cynical cash grab. I'll give it to you straight. It wasn't teribble; but it wasn't good either. I tend to think that as the second stand alone Star Wars movie, they didn't need to deal with such an iconic character, unless the story was so compelling that it just needed to be told. And based on the evidence here, it wasn't and didn't. 
The casting was clunky. Clearly aimed at luring a few more bums on seats by appealing to the fan bases of TV pop culture juggernauts Game Of Thrones and Westworld with their respective leads showing up here. I'd pay little attention to this gripe if the movie was fantastic, but it fell far short of that. 
The attempts at humour are hit and miss, and whatever character development there was left me uninvested in their fates; No emotional engagement as I had in Rogue One. 
All in all it was underwhelming and disappointing and as I'm well into my middle age years, I see this as purely an exercise at gaining box office dollars rather than delivering a worthy chapter in the epic Star Wars universe."
"2937","Solo: A Star Wars Story",NA,"It's the same as every other generic CGI-fest movie that comes out of Hollywood every week","Really, there's nothing special here. Solo: A Star Wars Story is just another movie in the ocean of bad ones that tries to aim for the lowest common denominator in order to bring some bucks for the studio behind it, while it also shamelessly tries to capitalize on the Star Wars name that seen better days. It doesn't have a clear vision - hell, it doesn't have any at all. The pacing of it is all over the place. The story is cliched, weak, it lacks a strong direction. The jokes most of the time fall flat - most of the time they do not work or feel inappropriate and forced. Also the movie's tone is quite inconsistent, while the actors don't really do a convincing job portraying their characters either.This movie sums up perfectly what Star Wars has become. What once was the holy grail of pop-culture and a shining beacon of hope that showed how mass-appealing movies can carry just as important messages as art-house movies and dramas, turned into something that's anything but reminiscent of Star Wars. It feels like a 4 days old dry burger from a fast-food restaurant that was halfly chewed and spitted out.There's only one good thing in this movie that leads to my two star rating: as much as it tried through it's entire runtime, it wasn't able to spin SW in the mud the way The Last Jedi did. This movie just wasn't able to be as disrespectful to the world and characters of Star Wars and to it's fans as The Last Jedi was. Because making such an unbelievably bad and insulting movie takes true talent - that the 'masterminds' behind Solo (fortunately) did not have. Or maybe it just wasn't able to make things worse, because Rian Johnson already killed the Star Wars movies, at least in my eyes."
"2938","Solo: A Star Wars Story",10,"Expected to hate it (based off of adverts) LOVED IT","Despite being a huge fan, I had lost faith in Star Wars and Disney after the abomination that was TLJ and then the adverts for Solo. THE ADVERTS DO NOT DO THIS FILM ANY JUSTICE. I fully expected to hate it and ended up leaving the cinema completely shook. The casting is perfect and all of the lore is spot on. No ridiculously over comedic parts (like the ones in TLJ) Please give this film a watch, you will not regret it. FAITH RESTORED"
"2939","Solo: A Star Wars Story",8,"Great Star Wars for Adult ! Why so underrated on imdb? I just watched it and it was great! at least 8 of 10!","I watched Solo on Wed, 23 of May 2018 at XXI at Baywalk Mall Pluit in Jakarta, Indonesia and didn't have much expectation as it shows low rating on IMDB (around 5.6 smthg). However, i was very surprised with the outcome. This movie is great, but why it shows such low rating here. Emilia Clarke performs so well here and i think she needs no 'blood of the dragon' any longer, as she looks hot here too. The American actor casted as Han Solo worried me a bit in the opening of the movie as he looks somehow a very serious personality compared to Han Solo played by Harrison Ford (a character which should be such a funny douche bag), but as the movie moves from scene to scene, the character played by Aldenrich convinces me that he is that Han Solo just like in the original Star Wars. I can't wait for the sequel, and don't tell me i don't know Star Wars, I grew up with it and already saw all Star Wars Movies from 1 to 6, and all the disney sequels. I'm giving it 8 out of 10!!!!"
"2940","Solo: A Star Wars Story",3,"yes of course it is better than Jar Jar Abrams' trilogy!","But what isn't?On its own it is vapid and pointless.
Two hours of cliched fluff and then credits. That is it. A waste of time, stay away."
"2941","Solo: A Star Wars Story",6,"No happiness or anger - Just an average feeling in between","""I have a really good feeling about this!"" That's the line that Han says in the trailer that's playing in the cinema before the movies. And I remember my friend leaning over to me and saying: ""I hate that he says that so much"". There's no denying that all of my friends felt that this movie was not needed, me included. But we got it nonetheless and I always wanna give every movie a chance. ""Star Wars"" has been a very meaningful and inspirational saga for me and my family since ever before I can even remember. When Disney took over I held out hope that the new adventures would give me some joy of revisiting these characters in this world that I love. Unfortunately, I have been feeling more and more let down about the whole situation. I'm not gonna get into it here because there's too much to discuss. And there's already plenty of people who have voiced their displeasure of the mishandling of this property. The fear of us getting a new SW film every year is that the specialness will fade away. That they no longer feel like the events they were and that SW becomes over-saturated. It's been talked to death on other platforms, I know. I'm gonna get to what I thought, since that's why you are reading. Well, I did my best to go in with no expectations. Just to be open with the whole ""expect the worst and hope for the best"" type thing. And yes, you feel the ""Star Warsy""-ness, but I couldn't help but to leave the cinema less happy than you should watching a SW movie. The action set-pieces, the references and the practical effects are appreciated. But the core of the story needed more.Every beat of what you sort of expect to happen happens. Chewbacca and Han's friendship was what I bought the most. It honestly felt pure and sympathetic. They got that right. Of course, the heist stuff is fun, but the care for the people and story? Other than the fact that you already know some of them based on previous films, you don't feel the importance of why this needed to be told. It becomes an un-eventful film in the series that really adds nothing new to what you already know about our main characters. It's nice to see Lando because you know him, but in the end he is just there in surface-level form. Nothing against Donald Glover, he was a great casting choice. But if this was your introduction to him or Han, then I'm not sure how much you would care. The reason I felt I could care a little was based on knowing who Han or Lando are in the other movies. I will again say that I enjoyed when the sense of urgency kicked in. You know, when a mission or quest is presented and you go: ""Yeah, I'm ready. Let's go on an adventure"". It's unfortunate that the adventure leads to no special impact. Creature effects and designs felt organic to the world, so that was nice to see. I bought the underground gambling places a lot more here than I did in ""The Last Jedi"". Here they blended in to the world and didn't distract. Everything looked and felt like it belonged in the SW universe. Although I would be happy if they didn't over-relay on everything that's nostalgia. Some new element would be nice to introduce. But this movie lands in a safe zone where no big leaps of risks are taken. The problem is that it failed to engage me in the actual story.The movie didn't make me feel happy or angry, it's a feeling in between. It's probably just fine, but you won't remember most if it. An average sci-fi movie that doesn't do much more than to be mildly entertaining. I have nothing against Ron Howard. I feel more bad for him because he had to take over mid-production and fix what he could. I respect the commitment in his effort, but I think I would have done some changes to make sure it got a warmer reaction. How about Alden ""Would that it were so simple"" / ""The rules don't apply to you"" Ehrenreich? Well, he's not a bad actor, kids. Leave him alone. The issue is that I just couldn't buy him as Solo. I'm sorry, Alden. You did your best, but you seemed more like another character. There's glimmers towards the end that remind you that it's supposed to be Han, but again, it's surface level. Not to say that I didn't think his character was like-able. No, he has charisma and humanity about him. But it's sad that it's never to the point where he earns the role and you go; ""That's Solo!"". I'm gonna end the review by saying that I'm conflicted about it. There are fun scenes to enjoy, but the the bigger picture is... kind of ..uninteresting. I hate to say it, and the worst part is that I'm starting to feel ready to let go of the new SW. If ""Episode IX"" doesn't give me the motivation to see what happens next, then... What's the point?PS: There's a cameo at the end and it was actually the most unexpected and exciting part of the movie. But it's also a little bit like: ""Oh, I'm happy to see you.. But, what.. Why again?"""
"2942","Solo: A Star Wars Story",1,"Thanks for the input Disney bots.","Before I tee off on this piece of garbage disguised as a Star Wars movie using only cheap cinematic nostalgia magic tricks and sleight of hand, all you really need to know is that this is the ""Greedo shot first"", version of Han Solo. The completely unbelievable version of a ruthless smuggler who owes the whole galaxy money and lives on the run. Nah, this is cutesy pretty boy Han, who's weakness would be savagely taken adavantage of among the space scum in that line of work. Point being; right off the bat, the character doesn't fit who he would need to be to believably live on the run breaking the law. So, now the fun part. You can always tell it's a Disney bot/click farm when they start the review with something like ""i didn't like the last one, but...."" or ""don't listen to The haters"" ""my opinion is worth more than anyone Bc I'm 13 years old and have never lived my life without a constant stream of dopamine release from internet likes."". Matter of fact, it would be even worse if it wasn't bots working to keep the average score above 7. If these people are just average humans reviewing the movie, why do they care what other people think? It's almost as if it's really about not only feeling part of some arbitrary greater collective, but being the most loyal media slave. They need others to like the movie so they can know what to like; Actively fighting to deny Disney doing this for any other Reason beyond hi jacking & inserting subversive but subtle mind control into the most popular fictional franchise of all time. These people are clinging to a last shred of self dishonesty Bc they don't want their number one method of escapism taken away from them: leaving them only with the uncomfortable truth of which they've spent their whole lives sanding the edges down, if not running full speed away from it. All whilst being encouraged to do so subtlety underneath the surface of the 4-6 hours of tv watching daily. Throw phones into the equation and the average lemming is in front of a screen for 8-10 hours a day, happily and gullibly following the one directly in front of them off the proverbial cliff. When u start the review with not liking another movie, it's makes it sound real, ya kno? Like no one can watch this movie and actually dislike it, it has to be an attitude of disdain toward Disney that does it, or being a ""hater"". It's as if Thyre not lemmings who think they have to like something To be relevant in this culture of escapism and franchises that have risen above criticism. Well I'll take it to the opposite side, I thought both the new trilogy episodes were awful(TFA especially, watch it after the buzz of it being a new continuation to the orbital story wears off if you haven't, and there's zero redeeming value to it) but really enjoyed ""Rogue One"". I was robbed of so many of my passions when Disney bought everything from Marvel comic books to Vice news(go ahead and google it, u didn't know they Owned the propaganda for hipsters mill), with the only intention of wringing them dry of every cent, until every piece of power is stripped from the storytelling and we can't stand to even hear the words Skywalker or superhero without becoming nauseous. When u own the full spectrum of media consumption (ESPN, abc, A&E, soon to be FOX, Pixar, marvel, Star Wars, I can keep going but I wont)it's about something far more sinister than simply financial gains. Club 33 y'all. Shhhhhhh! Anyone find the classic hidden weird subliminal messaging designed to wear down a child's moral compass and initiate them, unbeknownst, into an occult state of being? Back to the point ar hand. Steer clear of this garbage. Beyond the inconvenience of remembering the real Han thru out the flick and how terribly off The guy who plays this ""I didn't shoot first"" version of solo is; he's also an absolutely horrendous actor. The only redeeming quality of this movie is Emilia being super easy on the eyes with her beauty. Boba fett is the next character to be systematically decimated by the Disney machine. At least rent this or DL it so that Disney doesn't get their cut of the ticket prices.....there's an attempt at a story in here somewhere under the cheap nostalgia triggering cinematic tricks in between lowest common denominator WAY over CGI'd space chases and laser fights that trick your subconscious into believing you're watching a Star Wars flick. This movie could've literally been 45 mins long but somehow got stretched to 2.5 hours. Anyone looking for an actual well told solo origin story should turn to AC Crispin's Han Solo trilogy of novels from the late 90s, far superior; way more enjoyable and believably character driven, and Ron Howard doesn't over milk every emotional sentence, thank God!!!"
"2943","Solo: A Star Wars Story",1,"A movie based on three lines from OT","SPOILER: I hoped this movie will ""makes things right"". Boy I'm happy I didn't pay for the ticket. This movie has no story. It's just a bunch of situations glued together. There's a meetoo robot, Alden is not Han, no villain, death in Star Wars movies doesn't matter anymore,. It just needs few years and a bad writer with lack of imagination and anything goes. You've seen Phasma die? We'll see about that in 9. I can't decide which movie is worst - Last Jedi or Solo. And I like Ron Howard. The guy once said A movie is 90% writing and 10% the rest. He's right. He just did his 10% and wasn't involved in the writing. It seems that rushing these movies (4 in 3,5 years) damages the quality of the story. In one word - terrible!"
"2944","Solo: A Star Wars Story",1,"Star Wars Is Dead and Disney Killed It","I won't waste your time - Star Wars is dead.This movie is completely unnecessary. It's bland, annoying, predictable and boring.
I honestly didn't think it could get much worse that The Last Jedi but it did.
The constant SJW identity politics that they insist on injecting into these movies has stolen the soul of the universe.
The robot is terrible (worse than JarJar). Han Solo is not charismatic like Harrison Ford. Lando is a joke. 
This movie was literally a cash grab and you are a sucker if you waste a single dollar on it.
If you have to watch this cesspool of of bad puns, cheap jokes, weak characters and terrible story - there's a torrent with your name on it.
Two enthusiastic thumbs! PASS!"
"2945","Solo: A Star Wars Story",2,"Yawn. A real snorer","Man I was pumped to see this movie, took my posse and everything. Well, I almost fell asleep! Boring, uninteresting, not funny - the list goes on. Waaaay too long, and failed to capture/hold our interests. We booked it as soon as the credits rolled because we were all really over it (not just my clan, EVERYONE in the theater scramed). In fact, I considered asking for my money back. Do yourself a favor and wait for the movie to come out for home viewing (or maybe just skip it altogether - it adds nothing to the saga). 2 stars for Donald Glover"
"2946","Solo: A Star Wars Story",3,"Feels Like a Disneyland Ride (in a bad way)","The best was to describe it is... it's like a Disneyland ride with a rushed storyline. Where they try to pack a story in 10 minutes and the actions scenes are intense, but seem to just work out for no apparent reason at all. And then at the end of the ride it's like, ""congratulations, you just saved the universe."" That's how Solo felt."
"2947","Solo: A Star Wars Story",1,"Don't waste your time.","I hated the last Star Wars. Last Jedi was horrible. I decided since I got free tickets to see this I might as well check it out. And happy I didn't waste my cash. This movie just a let down as the whole Star Wars universe went to crap. Disney destroyed this universe. I'm disgusted."
"2948","Doctor Sleep",9,"Perfect Balance","Finally got to see my most anticipated film of the year and I'm happy to tell you it's everything I wished for and more. Flanagan has done an amazing job adapting the book from Stephen King and giving lovers of the Kubrick film adaptation of ""The Shining"" (1980) a cinematic sequel.
Now i read the book and while I enjoyed it for the most part, I found parts of it underwhelming. I feel in this film adaptation, Flanagan takes elements from the novel and manages to make them more darker and serious which in turn really helped address some issues I had with the book. He does make some serious changes though and while I embraced them I'm not sure how others who read the book will feel about them. ""The Shining"" (1980) to me and I'm sure a lot of you, is a masterpiece in filmmaking. I for one prefer it over the novel and with this film, it most certainly feels like a sequel to Stanley Kubrick's version and a love letter to that film. The last 30 mins or so are absolutely amazing and kudos to Flanagan for pulling it off.
Ewan McGregor does a great job as an adult Danny Torrance and Rebecca Ferguson captivates as Rose the Hat. The film sets a great tone with some stunning visuals and the score completely grabs you. How much you enjoy this film really depends on what you want out of it. There's practically no gore here and no cheap jump scares. What you'll get though is expert filmmaking from someone who you can tell really loves the source material he's pulling it all in from. Everything struck a balance for me that I was tremendously pleased with, top horror film of the year."
"2949","Doctor Sleep",8,"Surprisingly, better than expected.","The ever-beautiful Rebecca Ferguson and a favorite from the Fargo series, Zahn McClarnon team up to bring us some somewhat scary, but more so eerie/creepy moments in this adaptation of King's Doctor Sleep. For the most part, and with the help of Ewan McGregor who plays an alcoholic, grown-up version of The Shining's Danny Torrence, they pull it off.While Doctor Sleep is a rather drawn-out and, mostly, slowish-moving film, it still has enough to it, to not lose one's attention. The story-line is solid and engaging, although those unfamiliar with the book and looking for outright horror and gore, will find little satisfaction. There are a couple of scenes which can be construed as ""horrific"", but in my opinion, Doctor Sleep is not really a ""horror flick"" by definition. To me, it is more like an intense drama about good vs evil, with a couple of well-done 'end-of-life' scenes thrown in. :)What I most enjoyed about it, is that in this day and age where practically every story ever has already been made into a movie, this one's plot was just a bit off the beaten path and came across as slightly new and original in its approach, while still pretty seamlessly tying it in to the well-known classic: The Shining.If I had to add one con, it would be a somewhat minor one, in that, at times, the girl who plays Abra (Kyliegh Curran), who also possesses 'the shining', and who can communicate with Danny, delivers her lines in almost a stone-like manner, and at other times as if she is rapidly reading. It occurred one too many times, and I found that it took me out of the movie for just a bit.While good, the scenes leading up to the ending are a bit predictable, and the 'showdown' (remember, good vs. evil) leaves a little to be desired. For the most part, however, I can live with it, seeing as Rebecca Ferguson saves it by just being in it, and King and the creators do their best to come full circle. In short, like the entire film itself, it is satisfying-enough to where one can feel as if watching it, was time well spent."
"2950","Doctor Sleep",8,"Excellent if you have the right expectations","If you are going into this film expecting it to be a straight up sequel to the Kubrick film with the same horror tone, you'll be disappointed, however if you have an open mind, this movie is very well directed and acted and the story is very compelling. This is more of a fantasy thriller than a horror film and I really like that about this film. It also does quite a bit of homage to the 1980 film, but takes it into a new and interesting direction with a deep underlying theme direct from Steven King."
"2951","Doctor Sleep",8,"One of the better film adaptations of a King novel","This is easily one of the better film adaptations of a Stephen King novel, and also one of the better films I've seen this year.
Yet again, professional film critics have proven they mostly have no idea about the cinema of the fantastic (fantasy, SF, and horror). If you're a fan of the genre, you'll love this film - ignore the critics."
"2952","Doctor Sleep",7,"Surprisingly a neat little companion piece to the classic! That doesn't just rely on nostalgia to tell their story","What a surprise... That wasn't so bad actually! Now, hear me out. When I first saw the previews for this I felt disappointed by the visual look of the film, as it was all too green-tinted and lacked the Kubrick-esque framing I want from a film like this (it being a sequel to ""The Shining"" after all). Remember, I care too much about the visual aesthetics of these things sometimes. Especially when it was clearly supposed to connect right to the iconic classic. The green tint stays throughout the film, much to my displeasure. Worked great in ""Joker"" though. But once I got what the story was and paid attention I realized I was getting invested. This is a different type of film while still remembering to pay huge amounts of respect to the legacy of the original. Once you do get to the elements that carry over from Kubrick's film it felt well earned. Interestingly enough they kind of blend well together too eventually. We delve into the supernatural aspects of what Stephen King was going after in his book, and that's completely fine. I don't mind a chilling spookie once in a while. Recently I've felt done with most of the modern day horror film tropes, so it's such a shock for me to say that I had a good time with ""Doctor Sleep"".The progression of where Danny Torrance's character goes to is a natural right step. They go for the 'father like son' kind of thing, and I was completely onboard with it. The ghost of Jack Nicholson's presence looms strongly over the story too, with Danny fearing not to follow his father's footsteps. The new story elements were able to grab my attention as well. Again, as soon as it clicked what type of plot/movie this was, then it worked. It's its own thing, and that's great. No ""Shining"" remake - except for some re-created imagery (handled with nice respect) - But most importantly: The story and characters moved forwards. Loved what they did with the character Rose the Hat. What a sinister yet oddly charming antagonist portrayed hypnotically by Rebecca Ferguson. Hope she gets the deserved credit. Ewan McGregor will always be Obi-Wan to me, but he was a fantastic choice to play Danny. He can convincingly make me believe that he's got the 'shine'. It surprises me how positive I feel about the movie! It's a neat little companion piece to the classic. Again, big props for them to go for their own thing. This is no ""Force Awakens"", if you know what I mean. You'll walk though memory lane here for sure. The difference is that it doesn't rely on the nostalgia to tell their story. It actually stands on its own. I'll say that if you're a big fan of the original, then it's worth taking a looksie"
"2953","Doctor Sleep",7,"3 hours long...","It deserves a good rating because besides its slightly average story(imo), they still managed to make me watch the full 3 hours in one sitting without feeling bored for a minute and enjoying it. Good camera work too."
"2954","Doctor Sleep",10,"If you get it you'll agree...","...mike Flanagan GETS IT. He feels it. Few people can translate this well from an original tale within a tale within a tale. YOU certainly can't!
If your heart doesn't beat to the soundtrack, and you don't feel those happy goosebumps several times during the film, then, history is lost on you.
After seeing this movie, you may have an awakening of sorts... and see the world's periphery in a new light...with details you may not have noticed before. At least that's what I hope for every person who gets a chance to enjoy this truly unique and amazing cinematic experience!"
"2955","Doctor Sleep",4,"A tedious ""Shining"" sequel deficient in real tension and dread","Almost four decades ago, Stanley Kubrick's ""The Shining"" not only terrorized audiences, but also sparked plenty of unique reflection and analysis on its remarkable use of suspense as both a cinematic device and a tool for fostering character development of its protagonist, Jack Torrance. The film's impeccable attention to detail has also ensured that it is still studied and well-respected today. As a huge fan of the Kubrick film as well as Ewan McGregor, I was really excited for ""Doctor Sleep,"" but unfortunately, I found it to be a huge letdown.The plot of this sequel centers around an adult Danny Torrance (McGregor,) working in a clinic in New England while also trying to deal with a severe drinking problem. He must work to defeat an evil cult called the True Knot, led by ""Rose the Hat,"" after a 12-year-old girl who also has the powers of ""the shining"" gets in its crosshairs. I was never expecting this film to top the genius of Kubrick, but Mike Flanagan seems like a talented director who wanted to really honor the source material, so I was hoping for it to at least try to be meaningful.The first major problem with the film is its tedium. While the pace of ""The Shining"" was slow, it was slow in a great way, as in ""slow-burn to build up maximum suspense and dramatic tension."" On the other hand, ""Doctor Sleep"" just feels tedious. Large stretches of the film pass by with virtually no keyp lot or character development not explored in other scenes, and the film feels repetitive and like it's going nowhere after a while until we get close to the climax. The film also lacks the genuine suspense and tension of the original, since this tediousness impedes on any sense of impending dread. I also feel that the more sprawling narrative of this story as opposed to ""The Shining"" may have been somewhat detrimental to its sense of tension. It also lacks the psychological fear of ""The Shining."" Even though the True Knot and its followers are creepy, attempts to build up a real sense of terror around them generally fall flat. Ewan McGregor tried his best, but his performance is unfortunately rather bland and very limited in range. The only real positive of the movie is that it's fun to see the Overlook Hotel again, but the climax still doesn't feel fully satisfying. Not recommended. 4/10"
"2956","Doctor Sleep",4,"Never got going","It's probably King's fault, but the bland story never seems to find its footing while slowly building up an excuse to go visit the Overlook Hotel.Ewan Mcgregor feels oddly miscast, barely moved by anything that happens and so making us not care about anything either. While most of the cast is there just to stand and talk (there's an awkward amount of standing in this movie), the lonely highlight Rebecca Ferguson is very animated, throwing everything and the kitchen sink to elevate the dull proceedings. But she only gets so far.When the action eventually returns to the Hotel, the last act barely connects to anything that happened earlier as it apparently was only there so that they could recreate the sets and scenes from the Shining. But everything is so poorly written that the Shining throwbacks come across dumb and pointless, draining the original story rather than taking it further."
"2957","Doctor Sleep",8,"Different Experience Than The Shining, But Still Worth Watching","While I don't consider it a masterpiece, I did enjoy the classic Kubrick rendition of The Shining, and I understand why it has the fan base it does. Seeing the trailer for Doctor Sleep and discovering Ewan McGregor was playing an adult Danny Torrance, I thought the concept might be interesting.Everyone acts fantastic in this film. I thought Ewan McGregor built a very nice character. If I had imagined how Danny might have turned out after the first film ended, I don't think I would have predicted it much different. There are a few intense moments with the villains (Primarily Rose the Hat and Snakebite Andi) that made me absolutely hate them (which is a good thing). I think the things they do in the film would make anyone want them to see a terrible fate.I found myself smiling at the call-backs to the classic movie, and when Danny returns to the Overlook Hotel. It's been a while since I've said to myself ""Oh wow, there it is"" that many times at a film. I will say there are a couple scenes at the Overlook that feel like they were written in to make the fan base happy rather than be part of the story, but nothing that drags on too long.As far as it being a scary film, you may jump a few times, and some scenes are a little disturbing, but by Stephen King standards, it's more of a suspense film.An advantage I'll give this film over The Shining is that even though the film is two and a half hours, it doesn't get boring. Not that The Shining was boring, but it is a very slow film. Stanley Kubrick loved to throw in very long shots in his films, and while I personally think they worked sometimes, other times they were excessive, and in The Shining, they were excessive to me.I think this film is at least worth a watch whether you're a fan of the Kubrick film or not, because it's sort of it's own film in a way. It shows enough of the classic film to have a connection, but also has a story different enough and good enough to hold it's own."
"2958","Doctor Sleep",6,"Doctor Sleep may not diagnose you to the land of nod, but tediously drains your shining spirit.","Director Mike Flanagan had an unfathomable task. To both adapt a Stephen King novel, which is no easy achievement considering his uniquely descriptive writing style, and provide a sequel to what many describe as ""the greatest horror film of all-time"". Quenching the thirst of King's avid readers and cinephiles alike. So even without divulging my own opinion on Doctor Sleep, applause must be given for just producing this feature. That, unfortunately for Flanagan, doesn't result in myself excusing specific inexcusable filmmaking tendencies that taint, not just Doctor Sleep, but various decaying intellectual properties that have been unnecessarily drudged up again.An alcoholic scarred Dan Torrance, having endured the irrevocable dangers of the Overlook Hotel ('The Shining'), has his peace shattered when he encounters a young extrasensory girl whom is being hunted down by shine-draining monsters.First and foremost, I have not read the novel, although this should not come as a surprise. I have however, watched 'The Shining' multiple times. Now, what promotes the aforementioned horror as the best of its kind, is legendary Stanley Kubrick using the essence of King's novel and essentially making his own iteration of it. One that the renowned supernatural writer still, to this day, has mixed emotions for. So for Flanagan to introduce some faithful interpretations of Doctor Sleep, whilst maintaining the cinematic endeavour that Kubrick meticulously crafted, is as I said, unfathomable. And there's a perfectly valid reason for that. The overtly supernatural strands of the novels do not complement the genesis of terror from Kubrick's film. Which is why, with great regret, I have to report that Doctor Sleep does not work. It doesn't.A beastly behemoth that, whilst does stand on its own two legs, relies on heavy-handed storytelling techniques and nostalgia to tackle both mediums that inspired it. In tonality, they are irrefutably different from each other. But before the disappointing third act is tackled, let's address some positives first.Doctor Sleep is a shining example of depicting childhood trauma and how fragmented coping mechanisms are embedded throughout adulthood. Young Danny imaginatively designs mental traps so that he can hold the starving ghosts from the Overlook in captivity. Yet that wilful mentality does not prevent him from suffering with alcoholism, substance abuse and an insalubrious lifestyle that masquerades the trauma instead of curing it. Thematically, this is powerful, and grants the narrative a solid cohesion throughout. For the first two hours, you subconsciously warm to Danny due to the tormenting fears he has established throughout the two films. He's a pillar of ""the shining"". McGregor consistently captivated by depicting a fragile mentality through a physically demanding performance, maintaining the entranced demeanour of his younger character.The first hour, that heavily explained ""the shining"" and the intentions of the merciless antagonists The True Knot, experienced inconsistent tones due to the mass sprawl of locational change. One minute we're in a sleepy town, the next a woodland area, and then all of a sudden eight years have been and gone. The zippy nature of the editing and bloated exposition resulted in atmospheric terror being abolished. The tension was non-existent, and the imitation of Kubrick's directing style paled in comparison.Then, the second hour commenced, which is by far one of the strongest acts the year has yet to offer. Flanagan retained a surprisingly dark tone that, was so shocking, forced audience members to leave the auditorium. The mind-space of Abra, a precocious teenager who has ""shine"", produced a transcendental imaginative battle against Rose the Hat, leader of The True Knot. Ferguson, who portrayed the primary antagonist, was sensational. Equalling the likes of Pennywise as one of the most enthralling King villains ever depicted. Sinister, unrelenting and bordering on near-lunacy. Controlling every scene from just her eyes alone, she enhanced the palpable tension. She made the second act. In fact, she made the film. The interjecting gore and darkness throughout the middling act abruptly astonished me, and settled for a direction that I thought would control the underwhelming first act.The third act then arrives, and the entire story crumbles much like the Overlook itself. Plagued by an overshadowing sickness that 'The Shining' had produced. Nostalgia. Remember that time where Jack viciously chopped the bedroom door down with an axe? Or that moment where blood came hurtling through the hallways in slow motion? What about Room 237? The introductory swooping camera movement that Kubrick embraced whilst the Torrance's drove to the hotel? The typewriter? Slowly walking up the stairs in a confrontational manner? The snow-covered hedge maze? The twins? No? You don't remember? Flanagan has got you covered. Nostalgia is a powerful tool, yet it must be handled with delicacy. The difference between imitating and homaging is very fine, and unfortunately Flanagan settled for the former.So much of 'The Shining' is replicated in the third act, scene for scene, that it was a near-identical copy without the textual substance that accompanied them originally. The re-casting of the original actors, despite Essoe bettering Duvall's performance (although not difficult), felt unnecessary. Almost tarnishing 'The Shining' in itself. Danny walking through the dilapidated hallways for ten minutes whilst Flanagan incorporates identical sequences, had no purpose other than to forcefully remind you that this is the sequel. Literarily, it never progresses Danny's character or the plot. Rose the Hat staring at the blood-spewing elevators? Pointless. Danny staring at an axe encased in glass? A suitable nod to its predecessor. Do you see the difference? Between imitation and homage? The third act was littered with falsified copies, preying on the nostalgia of fans. It's uninspired. It's mundane. And it made me a dull boy.Creatively, Doctor Sleep managed to infuse the very best of its adapted novel and preceding feature, but embellished the very worst techniques when conveying the plot. Psychologically stimulating without installing dread. Extrasensory without testing the senses. Dimly shining amongst King's supernatural adaptations."
"2959","Doctor Sleep",8,"Enjoyed it a little more than I thought","I didn't have a ton of expectations going into this movie but I thoroughly enjoyed The Shining (like much of the human population) so I was expecting a good continuation of the original story line. Overall I think Mike Flanagan was able to deliver.
The way the movie was filmed and edited really exemplified a typical horror movie. Doctor sleep includes a constant mist in the settings, there are a lot of dramatic slow panoramic shots, and the music is eerie and impactful.
The acting is pretty decent but in my opinion Rebecca Ferguson absolutely shined as Rose the Hat. Ferguson put in so much emotion into her character and her expressions throughout the movie were just so unsettling, it was pure perfection.
I didn't find Doctor Sleep to be very scary I might classify it as more thriller, there were a few jump scares and a few shots disgusted me but nothing really shook me to my core, which is fine.
Overall as an avid fan of horror movies and King I enjoyed this movie a lot and might even say it's one of the best horror movies of the year."
"2960","Doctor Sleep",8,"Doctor Sleep is a great film for fans of both King and Kubrick.","Although considered a timeless horror classic by both critics and audiences alike, Stanley Kubrick's The Shining (1980) remains famously loathed by Stephen King to this day. Despite the authors widely recognised disappointment with Kubrick's interpretation of his novel, the film has stood the test of time as one of horror cinema's greatest achievements. In 2013, King released a follow-up novel, Doctor Sleep, which provides the basis for Flanagan's latest King adaptation (his second following 2017's Gerald's Game) starring McGregor as a middle-aged Danny Torrance, still haunted by the traumatic events that took place at the malevolent Overlook Hotel decades ago. While regularly attending AA meetings, Danny secures a job at a hospice where he comforts dying patients with a little help from his supernatural abilities, soon acquiring the title of Doctor Sleep as a result of his unorthodox methods. Meanwhile, a group of quasi-immortals operating under the moniker True Knot seek to drain the steam from within supernaturally gifted children who 'shine', just like Danny, in order to retain their youth.Enter Mike Flanagan (Oculus (2011), The Haunting of Hill House (2018)) who was burdened with the insurmountable task of not only crafting an adaptation that King himself would be proud of, but also a sequel that would impress fans of Kubrick's acclaimed original. Flanagan, who stands as one of modern horror's most prominent writer/directors right now, strikes a perfect balance with Doctor Sleep. It is a film that establishes itself as a completely different beast to Kubrick's film, while also drawing just enough influence from what's come before to please die-hard fans of what Kubrick established with his own vision. Ewan McGregor is well cast as a damaged Danny Torrance, but it's Rebecca Ferguson's captivating performance as Rose the Hat, the enigmatic leader of the True Knot, that steals the show. Fuelled with malevolence, Ferguson's deranged antagonist serves as one of Doctor Sleep's most exciting performances, and she's an absolute joy to watch. Kyliegh Curran also turns in a solid performance as Abra, a gifted young girl who shares a telepathic connection with Danny.As is often the case with Flanagan's work, jump scares are practically non-existent. Instead, Flanagan focuses on atmosphere and tension to elevate the sequences of terror. During a grueling sequence that displays the True Knot's ability to drain children of their shine, Flanagan chooses not to hold back from depicting a scenario that will undoubtedly unease the most hardened of viewers. Stylistically speaking, Flanagan often channels Kubrick's visionary flairs to replicate certain shots that pay homage to the original film. Although both films are totally different from one another, Doctor Sleep serves as a terrific companion piece to the 1980 classic that fans of both Kubrick and King can appreciate. It's certainly an exciting journey with instances of some amazing cinematography (a sequence involving Rose scouring the night sky is a particularly captivating, dream-like moment), and Flanagan's screenplay is brilliantly paced, completely engrossing, and never dull. Doctor Sleep stands as the best Stephen King adaptation to be released this year, and one of the better horror efforts, too. Simply put, Doctor Sleep truly shines."
"2961","Doctor Sleep",4,"Not impressed","I was really wanting to like this movie, but it just wasn't there.
Especially after seeing all the high ratings, too many things throughout the movie had me scratching my head.
Definitely hard to follow a classic like The Shining, but this sequel could have been a whole. Lot better."
"2962","Doctor Sleep",5,"Dr Sleep is a children's film","This isn't adult fare as Kubrick's masterpiece was. As another reviewer mentioned it feels like you're watching Goosebumps most of the time. Infantile is the appropriate word."
"2963","Doctor Sleep",NA,"almost as bad as a Twilight movie","The film is almost as bad as a Twilight movie, barely ok for a Sunday afternoon movie, but when inevitably compared to ""The Shining"" it's a one out of ten. It feels like an insult to a Stanley Kubrick/ the Shining film.
Mike Flanagan has been doing a bad movie after another; when it doesn't work, it doesn't work, just let the guy go flip burgers at McDonalds and make something useful with his life; making movies isn't one of does things. The acting from the child Kyliegh Curran is very poor, nonetheless we cannot blame someone that young, she doesn't have the experience, the training or the natural talent, the person responsible for the casting is to blame!
Ewan McGregor is a great actor and did some good acting in the movie; but he must be desperate to participate in a mainstream movie to accept being part of a project like this; nonetheless it is ironic , since the ""The Shining"" had a bad public reception, only after it became a classic and was recognized for the masterpiece it is."
"2964","Doctor Sleep",4,"So bad it was funny","Yep. This movie turned into complete schlock for me. The acting was...meh, and the story was nearly off the rails. There was no character development past the 20 minute mark, no interesting ideas explored, and overall was little more than a fan service sequel with scene after scene going 'Hey, do you remember this part from The Shining?'"
"2965","Doctor Sleep",6,"Some Films Don't Need Sequels","If you go into this film expecting it to be anything like Stanley Kubrick's 1980s masterpiece of horror, you will leave disappointed. Let's just start there.Little Danny Torrence is now a grown man, and still haunted by the things that happened to him at the Overlook Hotel when he was a kid (understandably). Most days he drinks his hours away to silence the voices in his head. On a whim he travels to a new town and wile there, gets his life together, and meets a young girl Abra, who 'Shines' just like he does. Against his will he ends up protecting her from a group of powerful psychics, lead by Rose the Hat, who hunt young children with psychic powers in order to feed on them to make themselves live forever. In order to keep Abra safe Danny is forced to return to the overlook hotel and face his ghosts, in ore ways than one.Generally, this isn't a BAD film. It's entertaining enough. The problem is, it's following one of the most iconic horror movies ever made and it hard to forget that. There are a few great nods to the original, using both cinematography and sets and props to jog the memory of anyone who ever saw the original movie, so that's fun. But the plot is a little slow for me and lacked punch.Sadly most of this film was just...meh. It lacked the nail biting atmosphere that 'The Shining' had in spades. It lacked a lot of fear of any kind really. The recurring visuals (The naked Lady in the Bathtub for example) that were meant to be scary, by the end just induced eye rolls form me and while the acts of Rebecca Ferguson and her group of cannibalistic psychics were horrific, they weren't really scary. After the amazing experience of watching 'The Shining' last week in the theatre, watching 'Doctor Sleep' was just disappointing. I expected more.You do wait the whole film to see Danny return to the Overlook, and then when we finally get there, its anti-climactic and not really worth waiting for. Everything they do there to try and scare you has already bee done, you aren't shocked by anything you see. You can tell the director was trying to incorporate things from the first film, but his just comes off as a cheap imitation.But hey, don't take my word for it. Go see for yourself and leave a comment below."
"2966","Doctor Sleep",9,"Long time fan of The Shining - Was NOT disappointed.","I am a fan of the original ""The Shining"" so much that we spent our honeymoon at The Stanley Hotel - where Stephen King was inspired to write ""The Shining"".
Only an hour and 45 minutes away from our home, but truly felt like a trip into another time, in another world.
We had a blast, but I digress.
The choice the casting directors did in making Ewan McGregor the adult Danny, was perfect. And if I'm honest, as much of a diehard fan I am of Ewan McGregor, this was not a role that I felt he would ""Shine"" in.
I was super happy to be wrong.
He was PERFECT.
Acting was not either over the top unbelievably dramatic, yet not dull and under-enthused. He played the role absolutely perfectly balanced and realistic - about a man who has spent his entire life trying to dull his shine and the consequences it brings.
Nothing ever truly shocked him to the bone, which would be expected for a man who has dealt with shocking encounters since he was a child ... yet also did not act feelingless towards new encounters.
The little girl (forgive me as I do not know her yet, seeing this as the only movie I've seen her in) was AMAZING. Lovable and empathetic and powerful and determined.
I could absolutely see this turning into more sequels. I'm not a purist - but I do like stories to stay true to the original and this one did.
The AA speech about his father was dead on, to connect perfectly to the timeline of the original, as we can remember that ""Jack"" was ""on the wagon"" when they first entered that damned hotel. Little details like these MATTER when entering into the sequels world.
If they continued to use the same care and attention to detail that they did with Doctor Sleep, they could theoretically create more sequels and spinoff from this point on. Perhaps featuring new characters and even continuing on where the young girl left off.
I really enjoyed this movie. And 2 and a half hours went by super quickly, because it was never dull. And constantly moving at a steady pace, never turning into a dull moment - for even a minute.
Well done! I'm very very pleased with this movie that I honestly was very skeptical of, when I first learned it was released."
"2967","Doctor Sleep",1,"This should have been a seperate film not connected to Shining","This has nothing to do with Kubricks Masterpiece. Some people praising this like it's pure gold. I won't understand. I felt offended by the way this tried to milk the original film. There is a decent film hidden under a lot of problems but no Shining. Noooo way. I am pretty shure Kubrick would have hated this."
"2968","Doctor Sleep",3,"Very disappointed","Read and enjoyed the book a great deal . The movie not so much"
"2969","Doctor Sleep",1,"Like a bad, corny superhero movie","Yikes. Doctor sleep is a fitting name cuz you're gonna wanna by the time this movies finally over. It feels so much longer than it is. It's corny, cringy, the dialogue is bad, the characters are not believable, the story is predictable and goofy as hell. It's critically just not a good film. But even worse, it's not an interesting or entertaining one."
"2970","Doctor Sleep",1,"Disney?","I barely made it to the end, but stubborned through (self harm). Loved ""shining"". I was doubtful anything could measure up, but was not ready for how far this fell short. It generated zero psychological or emotional response. It was more on par with Disney's ""Witch Mountain"" than ""The Shining"". Perhaps if I was ten years old it would have some impact. Not really though, I watched Trilogy of horror over Disney at that age. The true sleep doctor is the director along with most of the characters in this movie. I feel that this movie was aimed more at appeasing current trends rather than to produce the type of artistry exhibited in ""The Shining."""

I honestly don't think there is anything wrong w/ this film! & it is a perfect sequel to the shinning! The soundtrack to this film. Makes your heart thump right along w/ it.. Rebecca Ferguson is a revelation in this film! She does some horrific things in it & I was just sitting in my seat in awe of her the whole time! The things Mike Flanagan pulls off in this not many directors can do! & it brings the shining back around in the most incredible way in this day in age! I mean the metaphor for this film is so true to what happens as you get older! It's been done a million times but not like this. I was cheering right along the whole theater.(early access passes!) I was crying through so much of the film.. critics are calling it the best Stephan king adaptation since the shining & They are so right! I mean it's a truly incredible film. So much is happening & u never feel lost OR over explained to like your an idiot! It's best to rewatch the shining before. Because it is straight up a sexual to it.Please see this in theaters you won't be sorry!"

"2973","Midway",10,"10 Stars from 26-year Navy veteran","If you want to bypass the quibbles and get straight to the meat of this review, please skip to my last paragraph.The Battle of Midway is a story that's well known to most Annapolis graduates of my generation and earlier. The battle was a key inflection point in World War II, perhaps the pivotal moment changing the course of the Pacific War.Although I loved seeing Henry Fonda as Nimitz in the 1976 version of ""Midway"" (Fonda was to play Nimitz in ""In Harms Way"" as well), unfortunately, I found that movie to be surprisingly dull, historically inaccurate, unnecessarily melodramatic, and generally not very good.Because my experience is that more recent movie renderings of historical subjects usually don't improve the historical accuracy (I'm thinking of 2001's God-awful Ben Affleck ""Pearl Harbor"" vis-à-vis 1970's ""Tora Tora Tora""), I did not have high hopes for this new ""Midway.""I was wrong.In short, ""Midway"" is a terrific movie. Not only does it get the history (mostly) right, it's a tight, elegant, and superb rendering that does the historical figures proud. It succeeds to pack way more into its 2 hour, 18 minute run length than you can imagine. It covers the attack on Pearl Harbor, the PACFLT-Washington tension & dynamic, Nimitz's ascension to command of the Pacific, LCDR Layton's contribution to the intelligence picture, Joe Rochefort's robe-wearing genius, Yamamoto's soul-searching, Halsey's tenacity, the ascendency of naval aviation, a tiny bit of the submarine contributions to the battle, and-oh yeah-the actual battle itself, to include the incredible, unbelievable jaw-dropping (but true!) heroism of our Yorktown and Enterprise naval aviators. And it does all this justice, in a superb bit of moviemaking.Can a 26-year Navy veteran like me find nits to pick on? Of course:
I saw a few collar devices that weren't pinned on right (I'm talking about you, Layton!)At least one scene that is historical legend but didn't really happenThe substantially underrepresented submarine role in the battle (being a submariner, perhaps my biggest regret)Some Annapolis grads wearing their class ring on the wrong hand (tradition has us wearing our rings on our left hand, not the right)Sailors not ""squaring away"" their Dixie cup hats the way they would have back thenI wish the Pearl Harbor officers' club was as nice as they portrayed it in the movie!They placed a non-existent cemetery on Pearl Harbor's Hospital PointKimmel didn't watch the attack from the Pacific Fleet headquarters, he watched it from his office on the Pearl Harbor submarine base (which later became my office and is on the national register of historic places)They would not have worn their service dress khaki in the Officer's Club-- they would have worn service dress whites (chokers)The band in the O-club would have been locals not sailors (they missed an opportunity to have somebody like Gabby Pahinui playing!)But the good stuff way exceeds the nits:
They got the Pacific Fleet headquarters right-- it's not the Pearl Harbor shipyard commander's buildingThey got the torpedo failures right-- torpedoes were terrible early in the warThey got the Yorktown repair in 48 hours in Drydock 4 in the Pearl Harbor shipyard right-- the shipyard rendering was near perfectThey got the code breaking room in the basement of the PACFLT headquarters right (when I was stationed there the room was being used to store furniture and I petitioned to get it on the national register of historic places)It might have been a lot of CGI, but it was really good CGI. They rendered Pearl Harbor almost perfectly. I could even make out my Ford Island house from my time as commodore, as well as a historically accurate rendering of Pearl Harbor Naval Shipyard, the Pearl Harbor submarine base, and of course, the ships and planes.Something I never thought I'd hear myself say: Woody Harrelson was superb as Nimitz. He's no Fonda, but he was understated and believable, the way I've always seen Nimitz in my mind. Not a casting idea I would have thought of, but it worked!Except for the collar device issue listed above, the uniforms were exactly right for the period, from the flat shoulder boards that were being used in that era, to the beaten-up look the ship's laundry would have given Service Dress Khaki, to the way the sailors were dressed, to the way the pilots wore their wings, etc.It even brought out the fact that movie director John Ford was on Midway doing a documentary when the battle went down. The fact that Ford volunteered for the Navy, saw battle, and was injured, while John Wayne remained (in his mind) safely at home, become a point of tension between the two men, with Ford being one of the few who felt comfortable belittling Wayne for his lack of service as the years went by.I really liked the outtro mini-bios of the real characters at the end. I didn't learn anything new there, but thought they were extremely well done.In the end the 2+ hours flew by for me. It was so good, I plan on seeing it again next weekend. What a terrific way to celebrate Veteran's Day.Of course, Roland Emmerich's prior movies have been, on the whole, simpleminded blockbusters. But this time he took a risk by doing something thoughtful, respectful, accurate, and artistic. The only way to ensure movies like this continue to be made is for the public to show we care about history and accuracy, and to make this movie a success. I very much hope it does well. Then maybe we have a chance of getting the right movie made about the Indianapolis.A final thought: I've been disgusted by many of the cynical, snarky reviews written by professional movie reviewers, many of which sneer at the bravery of the warriors depicted. Yes, the dialog in this movie is sometimes simple, tired, and trite. A few of the characters are not well developed, particularly the women. It's perfectly appropriate for reviewers to criticize elements of moviemaking. One reviewer made fun of the line of dialog where Best says ""This is for Pearl Harbor."" There is nothing silly or unreasonable about that line. You can bet one of the pilots actually said something like that that day. As somebody who survived 9/11 attack on the Pentagon, when I later went to Afghanistan, you can bet if I had the chance to do so I would have said, ""This is for Gerry DeConto,"" one of my friends who didn't make it out that day. But many these sneering reviewers have gone on to say to readers that because of these weaknesses, they should not see ""Midway."" Keep in mind that there were similar elements of Spielberg's ""Lincoln"" that could be considered inaccurate and/or over-the-top movie-making (most of the scenes depicted in Congress, for example), but on the whole the events portrayed in that movie are important for Americans to understand. Same is true here. So the point I want to make is this: a movie can have elements of poor moviemaking, and yet be an important movie for viewers to watch. ""Midway"" is one such movie. It depicts a poorly understood event in American history, but one that Americans should be exposed to. The events depicted, and the people depicted, are real. They really did these things. The bravery was real. Americans need to know this, and reviewers who have likely never risked anything in their lives should have the good graces not to sneer at those who have."
"2974","Midway",8,"Account of Crucial Naval Battle in Emmerich Style","This film is a straightforward retelling of the events in the first months of the War in the Pacific beginning with Pearl Harbor and culminating in the Battle of Midway (June 1942). In between, it also touched on Doolittle's Raid on Tokyo (April 1942) and the Battle of Coral Sea (May 1942). The story was told mainly from the point of view of two American soldiers, namely pilot Lt. Dick Best (Ed Skrein) who led his dive bomber squadron at Midway, and intelligence officer Lt. Comm. Edwin Layton (Patrick Wilson) who with his code-breaker team predicted the Midway attack.Along the way, we meet other famous American soldiers: Admiral Chester Nimitz (Woody Harrelson) Commander in Chief of the US Pacific Fleet; Vice Admiral William ""Bull"" Halsey (Dennis Quaid) who led the aircraft carrier USS Enterprise; Rear Admiral Raymond Spruance (Jake Weber) who took over the Enterprise for the Battle of Midway; Best's fellow aviators Lt. Comm. Wade McClusky (Luke Evans), Lt. Comm. Eugene Lindsey (Darren Criss) and Lt. Comm. Jimmy Doolittle (Aaron Eckhart); cryptographer Commander Joseph Rochefort (Brennan Brown) and Aviation Machinist Mate Bruno Gaido (Nick Jonas).The side of the Japanese Imperial Army and their unique military culture were also given fair screen time in this film. Admiral Isoroku Yamamoto (Etsushi Toyokawa) of the Imperial Japanese Navy and the Commander in Chief of their combined fleet, was portrayed with calm and quiet dignity. We also get to meet other Japanese officers and their own brands of leadership Rear Admiral Tamon Yamaguchi (Tadanobu Asano) who commanded the Hiryu with nobility, and Vice Admiral Chuichi Nagumo (Jun Kunimura) whose controversial battle decisions had negative impact against the Japanese campaign.The execution of the critical battle scenes are the main draws to watch this film. Director Roland Emmerich will always be remembered as the man who brought us ""Independence Day"" (1996) and ""2012"" (2009). Of course, there are big explosions and massive destruction here as well. The massive scenes showing fiery exploding seacraft and aircraft were rendered with crisp cinematography and meticulous visual effects to create impressive screen spectacles. The aviation scenes, particularly the dive bomber runs by Dick Best, were excellently staged, shot and edited to elicit an exhilarating rush.For its 2 hours 18 minute run, the story of the crucial naval battles and the heroism of its real-life protagonists were front and center here in ""Midway."" There were no fictional characters or cheesy love stories like in the first ""Midway"" film or ""Pearl Harbor."" While seeing some popular young actors like Criss or Jonas can be distracting, the all-star cast generally rendered honor and respect to the heroes they portrayed. Focusing on soldiers of lesser rank allowed for some intimate personal drama in actual battle situations, perhaps with not much depth as possible. As this movie is rated PG, so do not expect to see graphic injuries at the level of ""Saving Private Ryan."""
"2975","Midway",9,"Hollywood actually made a decent war movie without pushing a political agenda","This is probably the first time in over 50 years Hollywood made a solid war movie without inserting a sappy, contrived romantic sub-plot, pushing some radical political agenda, or re-writing history.
The movie is good. The dialogue is believable, natural, and convincingly delivered in almost all cases.While no movie is perfectly accurate historically - historians don't even agree on much, so who is to say - the few errors here are trivial and immaterial to the how events progressed. As somebody who is a buff on this period of the early Pacific war - reading every book by Prange, Lord, and many others - I was very impressed.I went into this movie expecting the worst from Hollywood, but this was their best historical piece in generations. Even the casting seemed to echo the real people in looks and demeanor.The Japanese point of view wasn't neglected either. While I can't say whether the Japanese dialogue was believable or well-delivered, by all outward appearances this acting was also top notch. The similarity between the real Admiral Nagumo and the actor was particularly striking. They made the right call in using solid Japanese actors speaking Japanese.The accurate portrayal of the friction between the Imperial Navy and Imperial Army with Emperor Hirohito almost powerless to restrain the militarists was very refreshing. This was a very important, complex contributing factor to the war. Few outside Japan and some narrow historical circles ever learn about this dynamic.About the worst I can say about this movie is the pace was too fast. Unless stretched into an 8 hour mini-series, I can't imagine they could have avoided this. With my background, I could fill in gaps and context the movie seemed to miss. Others might be left confused. Even though not well-read on this chapter of history, my spouse followed the storyline without issue and really enjoyed the movie as entertainment.Kudos to the producers, writers, actors, and entire crew. This was a job well-done and a fitting tribute to heroes like Layton and Best."
"2976","Midway",10,"GREAT WATCH!!!!!","I am a veteran and this was a hit. The special effects were good and I don't understand why people were saying it was too much. The characters were evenly played out in the movie and there was no stupid romance part that was in the last Pearl Harbor movie. It told the story amazingly and it dived right into what it's all about. You don't need too much character development to tell a story of four people during that time. It was such a great watch and I Definatley recommend it. It ranks up there as we were soldiers! It's been a long time a good war movie came out and this was it. And when you see other reviews about it's a disgrace to veterans don't listen to those reviews. Obviously they haven't been through tough times such as how these people lived. I was in live fire so I can compare. Enjoy the movie is amazing!"
"2977","Midway",5,"Unbelievable","Abundant, not-quite-realistic computer-generated images make Midway look more like a video game than a depiction of real-life events. The overuse of subpar effects is the most dominant - but hardly the only - problem dogging this film. Epic war stories are difficult to tell without focusing on a few characters. This film unsuccessfully juggles too many plot threads and too many characters to keep an emotional anchor to the simulated events unfolding. Woody Harrelson is outstanding, but other cast members cannot overcome the limitations of the material and the challenges of acting on computer-generated sets."
"2978","Midway",10,"Excellent Movie and Historically Accurate","This is an excellent historical portrayal of the Battle of Midway, and some of the events that led up to it. There is a lot of intensity throughout the film, and it shows how some of the decisions on both sides were truly a gamble in that time. There were no satellites, gps systems, or sophisticated radar systems. The only missing pieces to this movie, as noted by others, is the lack of US fighter planes. Maybe it is intended to focus mainly on the Dauntless pilots.
I took my wife and kids to see this movie, as it seems much of the history of this country is being forgotten. I am so glad I did. The kids had no idea that any of this happened.
As for the critics that wrote negative reviews and trashed this movie, I think attributes to a lot of what is wrong with this country today. People who decided not to see this movie, on Veterans Day weekend, based on the critics reviews, are truly missing an excellent movie.
This movie is historically accurate, with no lame love story, or fictional substories."
"2979","Midway",8,"More than you'd expect","Critics are trashing this film, I went into it skeptical. After, I'm not so sure why. They tell a simplified story of the events leading up to, and eventually the battle of midway. You get to see two sides of life, the Japanese and the American forces. The script is fine, acting is pretty good in my opinion as well (shout out to Dennis Quaid, he is a great salty kinda guy). CGI was not that bad, especially for fast paced scenes. Only complaint is it is a bit long, which I understand due to how much they wanted to include. But there were 2-3 times I thought it might end, but there were still a few minutes left. In the end, a solid war movie that, in my opinion, does a great job showing some brutality of war, in addition to brothership and slice of life of the time. A solid film to honor the brave men and women that died for a better future."
"2980","Midway",6,"Both good and disappointing - depends on the target audience","As someone very knowledgeable about the subject, I was somewhat disappointed. Whether it was the wrinkled uniforms, the painful dialogue, the over-the-top dramatics and exaggerated explosions (hey, it's Emmerich!)... it was clear the film was not made for people like me who know the details and the characters very well.The rating depends greatly on the target audience. It's clear this film was made for a younger audience, and as such, it does a very good job of conveying the history quite accurately. It's a lot to take on with a 2:20 movie (complete with a 6-month summary of events leading up to the title battle) and it does a fine job of that.Correct history of this great nation tragically just isn't taught anymore, so I heartily applaud any effort to do so. I just wonder if younger audiences have any desire to learn it. So if I'm rating from that perspective, it jumps up a few points.I just wish a little more care with the details and script had been taken to leave the older audience satisfied from our knowledge level."
"2981","Midway",9,"ABSOLUTELY SEE IT","I've read several of the critical reviews of ""Midway""; they seem to reveal more about the cattiness of the reviewer than any understanding of the movie, or its message.
I am part of the growing legion of American moviegoers who have pretty much given up on Hollywierd having any clue how to convince me to actually care enough about any of their offerings to part with the price of admission. I can wait a few months till they show up free on Youtube to confirm my suspicions that I haven't wasted my money.
I made the rare exception this weekend to see ""Midway"", because I'm a history buff, and the previews I'd seen showed promise that the story would be properly told. That said, I went in with the full expectation that it might fail my already low expectations.
Happy to say that it far exceeded my best hopes. Roland Emmerich has put together a gripping storyline that manages to get in all the important elements of an epic story in 128 minutes. For the story of the American victory at Midway is an epic tale that every American should become familiar with.
Few Americans today can fathom what dire straits the US found itself in in 1942: Our battleships lay in twisted ruins on the bottom of Pearl Harbor; we had four aircraft carriers facing a Japanese navy with twelve, equipped with aircraft which were far superior to anything that was then available to American fliers; those aircraft were piloted by experienced men who had honed their craft in four years of war in China. We helplessly watched as thousands of American soldiers, sailors and Marines in the Pacific Islands and the Philippines were made captive, beyond the reach of our aid.
All the Japanese had to do was to concentrate on Midway, overwhelm our inferior naval and air forces, and Hawaii and the West Coast would be wholly at their mercy.
The essayist Matthew Arnold once said, ""Have something to say, and say it as clearly as you can. That is all anyone needs to know about style."" Emmerich follows his advice. No actors involved in ""Midway"" will be nominated for an Oscar. Which is another way of saying that there are no star turns which detract from telling the story. I will say that the actors are very believable in their roles; as the son of a Marine who fought in the Pacific, I found their portrayals pretty convincing.
I'm firmly of the opinion that CGI effects are overused to distract from thin or non-existent plotlines. I credit Emmerich for using them to reinforce an already strong narrative. To those critics who found them overpowering, I inquire: How in hell do you think the shock of modern warfare registered on the men who actually faced it at Pearl Harbor and Midway? They called it ""shell shock"" for a damned good reason."
"2982","Midway",10,"what a great solid movie","Agree with other reviewer, this is the best war movie in a long time, it went through three historical events, attack on pearl harbor, doolittle Tokyo air raid and battle of midway linked together with a human story of a dive bomber pilot, and what a great history/story telling it was.
The beginning of the massive Enterprise aircraft carrier, shaking the theater with the Dolby sound has the feel of Star War IV Battle cruiser opening scene, and a tight story line and pace ensues. The CGI is the best, you don't see AT-6 Texan painted as Zero fighters, you don't see modern warships disguised as battle-hardened WW2 ones,from this point forward I predict we will see more movies with period-correct war machines. The movie has moments that make you sigh (dud torpedo that hit but didn't explode, bombs missed after pilot braved through clouds of flaks) and cheer (bulls-eyed on the giant Sun on the deck, and chain explosion of the littered ammos because of tactic confusions), this is Hollywood at its best in rare moments, no over lingering love story, no cliche stereotyped GIs, what you have are characters in a war trying to survive, trying to outsmart the other side, and trying but dying ... you can read about those three events before or after the movie, but for me, I enjoyed a great movie, finished till the credit ends and walked out feeling great, grateful and blessed as an American."
"2983","Midway",5,"Too much bad CGI","All i can say is this : it's typical when an american history story is put into a movie it gets descent scores. This movie is not bad, but the quality of the CGI for a 2019 movie is just not good enough."
"2984","Midway",8,"A commendable effort but needs a longer directors cut - RELEASE IT PLEASE","Midway is well made thrown back to the historical war movie epics of the 1960s and 1970s, covering a wide spectrum of elements that made up a key moment in history. It's not a perfect film, but its one of the best of its type to be made in a good long while.What MIDWAY provides us with is an ensemble piece narrative story covering events leading up to the turning point in The War In The Pacific, which was the battle of Midway. To invest us in the characters we're shown a snapshot journey of each of their lives from just before the attack on Pearl Harbour in December 1941 up until June of 1942 where the Japanese and American naval forces would try and surprise each other in what would be the battle of the films title. It's no easy feat to present us with a vast range of uniformed characters in the military, and get the viewer invested in them emotionally but the actors here to do well to make each of their characters stand out so when the film reaches its key climax we understand who is who and what their role is in the conflict. While some of the dialogue is obvious and overstated it serves the job with character dialogue scenes acting as segways from one historical stepping stone to the next as we follow the events that led up to the battle.Before I delve into the main negative, I will say overall this is a great movie which could be really enhanced by an extended edition or extra running time if if there's more scenes that were cut out covering the battle of Midway itself - and if so PLEASE PUT THEM BACK IN A LONGER CUT - PEOPLE WILL BUY IT ON BLU-RAY! This is where the main problem with this film lies. Over half of its running time is dedicated to the raid on Pearl Harbour, The Doolittle Raid and the battles leading up to and including The Coral Sea, the latter of which is told pretty much in one scene and a single VFX shot (Good though it was) - Not an issue per say, as this film is not called 'The Battle of The Coral Sea' - and while some of these scenes give much context and required emotional threads for both characters and the younger audience members alike, others really didn't need to be seen in this film. It felt as if the events surrounding the Chinese assisting the Doolittle Raid survivors was probably a condition of some VFX funding tax break for the Asian based post-production budget. An allied radio report of the raid itself, perhaps being heard by the pilots of the American carriers was really all that was needed. Whatever the reason, these scenes add little to the key story or characters involved in the subsequent battle and even though they sign post the path that led to Midway, it's not something that couldn't have been covered in a single title card at the beginning of the film. The battle of Midway itself, while well realised, is told a little too quickly. The Japanese attack on USS Yorktown is again covered in a single VFX shot with one line of dialogue from an observing carrier when it could have been such a nail biting moment. The tension that is achieved in the original movie between the Naval Commanders on both sides making the tricky tactical decisions in the battle is a little compacted here. We see the last batch of Japanese pilots taking off but we don't see the outcome of this decision nor get a sense of the damage they do to the Americans. Time spent earlier in the movie building up to events at Midway would have been better spent covering the key events of the actual battle itself, which though nicely staged, feels a little rushed at times. Although a fistful of scenes give us the Japanese perspective they don't show would have been crucial moments of drama such as the belief that their single strike on the Yorktown gave way to believed rumours that two American carriers had been sunk, and the initial spotting of the American fleet by their pilots is not shown at all.That said the stakes of the climatic battle are well realised here and the CGI is NOT poor, nor distracting as others have claimed, it is extremely well done and is far more effective and real on the big screen. You forget your watching visual FX after a point, which one assumes, is the whole idea. Where the earlier Midway film failed in its visuals of the battle, here you're really put in the seat of the plunging dive bomber or on the deck of the carrier during the numerous actions. It is a visceral experience to see these sequences on the big screen and one that shouldn't be missed.Credit too must go to Casting Director ANDREA KENYON. It can't have been easy to get such a great ensemble of actors together for one picture (the scheduling must have been a nightmare) and the scale of the film certainly demands and receives a top quality line-up. Ed Skrein is appropriately cocky as pilot Dick Best, while Patrick Wilson adds appropriate gravitas as the intelligence officer whose warnings about an imminent Japanese attack were previously ignored. They're backed up by an engaging Woody Harrelson, Dennis Quaid and the criminally underused Mark Rolston, who are all excellent playing the senior officers, while the younger cast including Keean Johnson, Nick Jonas, Luke Kleintank and Daren Criss, all do well to make the most of their parts. Given their limited screen time, credit must also be given to the Japanese cast - It says a great deal that the scene where Rear Admiral Yamaguchi elects to go down with his ship is one of the most moving in the film and creates much sympathy for the Japanese navy who were against the war with the USA from the very beginning. (Their evil actions depicted elsewhere are not spared however ,with the execution of American POWs gruesomely depicted)Director Roland Emmerich, whilst having made some past turkeys, is an extremely competent film maker who can handle both scale, multiple characters and action sequences without them turning into an unwatchable 'what the hell is happening now' Micheal Bay snoozefest. We can tell what is happening to whom and there is always a sense of where things are taking place and why in relation to the story. Dialogue is functional to mediocre so while not a flawless film, I have no doubt that several scenes were cut to make sure the film hit a manageable running time. There is a huge thirst for well made historical epics set within this time peroid and a strongly urge both the film makers and the studio to release a longer version of the film on other formats, especially if it covers more aspects of the later battle. This will push what is already a good film to the next level."
"2985","Midway",9,"A Solid War Movie That Puts Characters Over FX","The events of December 7th 1941 left an indelible mark on the psyche of America and became a date that truly has lived in infamy. Though historians, authors, and filmmakers have attempted to analyze the events during and leading to the attack on Pearl Harbor; there is still a great deal of interest about the attack and the aftermath.While Pearl Harbor was for many the opening shots of the U.S. entry into World War II; some would say that the stage was set earlier when the United States attempted to curtail what they saw as an aggressive and Imperialistic Japan by placing restrictions on their vital resources such as oil and the tonnage of their Navy.In the new film ""Midway"" we are given a glimpse into this when four years before the attack, when Edwin Layton (Patrick Wilson) meets with Admiral Nagumo (Jun Kunimura) who lets him know that hardline factions in his government have been buoyed by their invasion of China and will do what is needed to make sure the vital oil that is supplied by the U.S. remains constant.
Flash forward to the day of the attack and Layton who has warned that an attack was possible at Pearl Harbor is seeing his worst predictions come true. In the aftermath he is assigned to Admiral Nimitz (Woody Harrelson); who has been given the thankless task of taking charge of what is left of the Pacific Fleet and finding a way to stop the Japanese fleet.The U.S. finds themselves outnumbered, outgunned, and waging war with ships and planes that are inferior to the Japanese but they must find a way to overcome the great obstacles before them and defeat a relentless enemy.
Layton and a team of code breakers are convinced the Japanese intend to attack the island of Midway and go all in to set a trap with the goal of destroying the enemy carriers so the U.S. can gain an aerial advantage in the Pacific.With a strong cast which features Luke Evans, Dennis Quaid, Mandy Moore, Aaron Eckhart, Nick Jonas and a fine supporting cast, Director Roland Emmerich has given audiences a gripping war movie that despite the impressive visual effects; never loses site of the fact that this is a story of real people who found themselves in pivotal moments of history.The film also shows how the Japanese commanders had differing views of the Americans they fought. Some considered them to lack braveness while others admired their tenacity and were grateful that they had what they saw as inferior and outdated planes to attack them in.The film also does a great job showing the Doolittle Raid and how what from a military standpoint caused minor damage yet was a huge psychological boost as Japan believed they were immune from attack yet the American forces found a way to bomb Tokyo by the impossible task of using land based bombers off a carrier.The film is a great mix of human drama that shows not only the terrible toll of war but how a group of extraordinary individuals gave their all.4.5 stars out of 5"
"2986","Midway",6,"Historicaly correct but visualy not","I'm just coming from the cinema, Midway is a worth to see movie, but the filmmakers used a bit too much CGI, sometimes you feel like watching a Medal of Honor game trailer."

The cast of this film was outstanding and I was pleasantly surprised every time a new big name actor popped up on screen, I was really not expecting that. But even with all that star power the movie fell short, the overwhelming cast is really the only big positive for this film and the general historical story that it told.The movie does cover much much more than just the battle of Midway and jumps around quite a bit. That wasn't bad necessarily but it left you trying to follow lots of major events that happened during World War 2. This could be perfectly fine if done a little better but over all was not the end of the world.The two biggest things that were the downfall of this movie were the main character and the general look of the film. Ed Skrein is absolutely abysmal in this movie, his acting was bad, the depiction of a historical figure was terrible and the fake accent he was trying to do was just grating in all regards. He was such a bad choice for this film and brought down the stellar performances of all the much more seasoned and proven actors who were in this.The movie is almost all done CGI which was to be expected after all but it looks so cartoonish and bad. The entire time I was watching it I was wondering how this new film could make this all look so bad when it had been done in the past and looked so much better. The best example would be Pearl Harbor from 2001. That film used CGI as well but it looked so much better. I wish who ever had been in charge of visuals for that movie had done this one too. It took you out of the epic events that they were showing.If you are in the mood for a good World War 2 movie look else where. I have no intention of ever seeing this again and viewed it as more a wast of time than anything else."
"2990","Midway",3,"Entertaining for 9 year olds... dull for the rest of us","So my boys (9) liked it... especially the action sequences. I on the other hand didn't. Some good stars but all lacking any sense of believable performance, with a script that lacked narrative, coherence or direction just lots of cliches and other words. Given the Historic event and the heroism associated with it, just how Emmerich managed to produce something so uninspiring and lifeless is beyond me. The back and forth between the front and the home is laughable. Cardboard cut out Japanese characters and superficial un-engaging American heroes were boring, the action sequences overblown and exaggerated up-to and including planes flying through wave tips and the wreckage of other planes only to emerge unscathed, combined to stretch credibility to beyond breaking point. 2hrs and 18 mins of my life that I will never get back."
"2991","Midway",7,"Awesome movie","Far better than what I thought it would be. Tense War movie. I really enjoyed this movie which is based on true life events. Please don't think this movie is anything like the pearl harbour movie because it isn't."
"2992","Midway",6,"Just an OK movie","Overdone special effects. The story was historically accurate but the plot was pretty boring. Maybe they tried to cover too much time in one movie. The 1976 Midway was much better"
"2993","Midway",10,"Historical accuracy leads to an awesome movie!","I had high expectations for this movie, and they were absolutely MET and EXCEEDED.In my opinion, ""Midway"" is the best and most historically-accurate WWII movie of recent memory, and it's one of the few that actually highlights the air war in the Pacific. The writers seemed to recognize that simply recreating this momentous series of events was an amazing story in-and-of itself, without wasting time on unnecessary drama and distractions.You can tell that the writers, producers and actors all paid close attention to maintaining historical accuracy throughout the film. From Pearl Harbor to Midway, they captured many of the key interesting and critical moments along the way. They also showed both the American and Japanese perspectives in an insightful and respectful manner, which only adds to the complexity of the story.Also, the action scenes will have anyone (history lover or not!) on the edge of their seats the whole time! I loved every moment showing the SBD Dauntlesses and the processes of dive bombing, and I enjoyed their portrayal of the Doolittle raid.Finally, the casting was great. Each actor portrayed his or her real-life counterpart in a masterful and poignant way.In short, I can't recommend this movie enough. It's incredibly important to remember the courage, daring and skill of the men and women who fought in WWII, today and every day. This movie brings their sacrifices and skills to life."
"2994","Midway",10,"Awesome!","This remake of the original 1976 movie was much more historically correct. It was obvious that everyone involved researched and studied the history behind the greatest naval battle in history! Kudos to all the actors, directors and producers for making an entertaining and quality movie!"
"2995","Midway",10,"Best WW2 movie in decades","Finally there is a WW2 movie with the right balance of modern effects and good storytelling. I've always preferred the straightforward stories in Tora Tora Tora and A Bridge Too Far over the newer gory angst filled war movies and those which deal with obscure insignificant incidents. Unlike Bay's Pearl Harbor or the older Midway movie there is no wasted time on silly romances. Also the dragginess of Eastwood and the gore of Spielberg are not present here.The screenplay is clear and comprehensive from pre Pearl Harbor to the decisive day everything is clearly explained. Doolittle deserves mention. Good history lesson for some folks nowadays who seem to forget which country was defending themselves against those who waged aggressive wars! Slower moments are not dull as they are used to explain strategy, training and the role of intelligence.The air battle scenes and dive bombing scenes are thrilling yet clear. You can still see who is who. You are really put right into the center of things. Superb exciting cinematography without looking fake or too CGI.The casting is brilliant. Using distinctive famous actors to portray the various heroes helps the viewer remember who is who and build up sympathy for whether they make it or not. Ed Skrein usually the anti hero type role. Here he plays the cocky pilot and his eventual vulnerability is touching. Luke Evans is convincing as another hero pilot. Patrick Wilson is perfect as the intelligence officer who helped get it right. The older actors like Denis Quaid and Aaron Eckhart are well cast too and Woody usually a goofball is fine. Actors usually don't associate with historic roles like Darren Criss and Jonas are surprisingly right. Mandy Moore looks pretty and suitable in her WW2 getup. Should do more roles from this period. The Japanese naval officers are distinctive enough to differentiate.A truly international effort it took a German director, Chinese producers, an American writer and great British and American cast to make the best WW2 movie in decades."
"2996","Midway",8,"Good movie with a few glaring errors.","First, the cast was great, especially Woody Harrelson as Chester Nimitz. The Battle scenes and the movie itself, were far superior to the 76 version, and they left out the lame love story. The two biggest errors were: Wade McCluskey loses his bomb due to an electrical arming error in his dauntless (he was also a dauntless pilot, but they did Hollywood it up a bit), and they never once showed an American fighter, which is a glaring omission. The F4F Wildcat was the fleet fighter at the time. Both it and the horrible Brewster Buffalo (flying from Midway) should have been present. The torpedo hitting a Japanese ship and failing was totally true, in fact, one broke up and floated, enabling Japanese sailors to use it to be rescued. This was thanks to the penny pinching of the US government before the war. Some authors I'll suggest are, Prange, Lord and Symonds if anyone wants to know more."
"2997","Midway",6,"Just mehh","Pretty bad CGI and terrible acting from some actors including the main character. Sound effects are brilliant in the other hand.All in all not a good movie, but an interesting war-flick."
"2998","Offering to the Storm",5,"It never seems to end","There's a mess of subplots and side plots so that most of the movie is filler for the central story. 2hrs 20 is a long slog for a pretty simple story if they just stuck to it but they have to drag along so much. Keep in mind also she's a terrible detective who does almost no detective work."
"2999","Offering to the Storm",3,"Average","Not as good as the first two parts. Inspector Salazar also evolves into a creep screwing around on her husband and newborn baby. Disappointing storyline which didn't flow well."
"3000","Offering to the Storm",5,"Just en ending","Do not expect more than that. The first two movies were good, this one is only ok.
It's a pity though... It had a lot of potential."
"3001","Offering to the Storm",4,"Not an atmosphere","The film does not create the right atmosphere, the staging is weak and the cinematography poor, in general it doesn't achieve a good rythm, the structure is blurred"
"3002","Offering to the Storm",2,"Deadly Boring from the Gitgo","I forgot my promise to not watch any Spanish shows. This is what I get for forgetting. NO MORE SPANISH SHOWS FOR A LONG TIME. THEY AE DEADLY BORING, CONFUSING AND MAKE NO SENSE WHATSOEVER. WHO WAS THAT SECOND BABY WHO POPPED UP AND HOW COULD THE DUDE STEAL A BABY CORPSE FROM A FUNERAL HOME AND RUN FOR FIVE MILES? THINK I'LL WATCH THE VIKING SHOW. ONE GOOD THING ABOUT NETFLIX - THERE'S A LARGE MENU OF SHOWS TO CHOOSE. FROM."
"3003","Offering to the Storm",3,"Too Many Bundled Sceneries","Suspenseful opening then trilogy starts to ignite with numerous deaths linked to noncompliant accessories of cult killings, homicides along with a problematic marriage. Too many pointless scenarios with no continuation."
"3004","Offering to the Storm",8,"Satisfaction","Perfection in mystery, suspense and of course don't watch Offering to the storm if you haven't seen previous part 1 & 2. Having studied history, mythology regarding ancient basque mythology and mysticism, one can see that most of these macabre events in this trilogy have actually occurred in mankind's history. Of course read the books and you will find that the story follows to the letter."
"3005","Offering to the Storm",9,"Offer english subtitles when they speak English","I really enjoyed this but I can't make out a single word her husband says in any of the 3 films, the Spanish is fine.Watch this it's really good, creepy and atmospheric and it rains a lot."
"3006","Offering to the Storm",2,"Bad ASF","It's a waste of time, at first is interesting but then it gets bored asf, trust me"
"3007","Offering to the Storm",8,"Great ending","A great ending to a captivating trilogy, the storyline was well developed and tied up most loose ends. The suspense was kept up throughout, the acting good, and the cinematography beautiful. As an English speaking viewer, I appreciated the dubbing, it was done well."
"3008","Offering to the Storm",7,"Not bad","But different than the first movie. More dark and disturbing. Still entertaining and suspenseful."
"3009","Offering to the Storm",9,"An epic ending","An epic finale to the Bazan trilogy.
An esoteric Spanish thriller.
It deals with the inspector's investigations to find her mother and find the origin of the section that has been guilty of the crib deaths.
First is ""The Invisible Guardian"", then ""The Legacy of the Bones"" and finally this installment.
Although the plot continues to take quite a few turns it keeps you hooked.
Although the ending is predictable, getting to it sometimes gets a little tiring.
Quality. Entertaining
Initiative where the legacy of the bones ends, it is essential that you see the previous two since without the history it will make you lose yourself.
The problem sometimes is that the language is quite run over.
The few action scenes are of quality.
Photography and sound effects are masterfully cared for.
The performances at the level."
"3010","Offering to the Storm",8,"Folk Horror","Offering To The Storm: So the Baztan Trilogy comes to a conclusion. Just as The Legend Of The Bones cast a new light (or darkness) on The Invisible Guardian, this third offering recasts the previous two films. The three (and all of the killings) are inextricably linked as a tale of Folk Horror. Inspector Salazar continues her investigations but suspects die or commit suicide, even those in prison. Someone appears to exercise mind control over life and death. Salazar's mother is missing after jumping in the river but still operates through others. Infants are sacrificed to the Old Gods in the hope of gaining wealth and good fortune. A Cult has revived an age old tradition that lived on in the shadows in the Baztan Valley. The Opus Dei Priest/Psychiatrist appears again as does the enigmatic Investigating Magistrate. Some truly disturbing scenes involving true horror. A worthy addition to the Folk Horror Film Canon. Directed by Fernando González Molina from a screenplay by Luiso Berdejo. In Spanish, English and Basque, subtitled and dubbed. On Netflix. 8/10."
"3011","Offering to the Storm",4,"AKA The Crying Detective & Her Weak, Inconsequential Husband","I, like a lot of other folks, are suckers for modern-day detective thrillers especially those from Europe. Nordic noir is one of my favourite genres as well as Asian and American if it's done right. ""Offering the Storm"", unfortunately, was a weak cloer to its trilogy. Where the heroine was stoic and strong in the first two, here she's just a blubbering mess of emotions, crying when her toenails get stubbed, or crying when a cat falls out of a tree. I'm being facetious, but my goodness, if you're a detective, DEAL with tragedies head on, not whimper like a soulless moron who'd never seen blood before. Other than that, the movie was shot well and filled with ample twists and turns. Recommended? only if you don't mind seeing supposedly strong characters fall flat on their face whenever it rains. smh"
"3012","Offering to the Storm",4,"A good attempt","A good attempt at a film that could've been great. Unfortunately the slow burn gets the better of the film and it if you're guessing what you're thinking, then you're probably right. It's slow and long and unsatisfying. Acting is good, plot is decent. Could've been made 30 mins shorter and would've turned into a more gritty suspense thriller."
"3013","Offering to the Storm",5,"Just an ordinary crime movie","The story is about some cult and murders of infants for sacrifice. I expected some mysterious or supernatural development in the movie, but it turns out to contain none, or at least I couldn't see. So it turns out to be just an ordinary crime movie without any surprises. It's ok to watch it but you won't miss anything if you do not."
"3014","Offering to the Storm",8,"Incredible movie triology!!!<U+0001F918><U+0001F918><U+0001F918>","This is an amazing movie. However there are some silly sex scenes between characters which can be disturbed for some viewers. Definitely those silly sex scenes are quite unnecessary or unrelatable with the original storyline/theme of the movie. if they are absent in this movie, i will give 10/10. Still a pretty much decent typical spanish crime thriller movie."
"3015","Offering to the Storm",4,"First one was good, 2nd Unbearable and the 3rd is the worst of the lot","The first movie had a great premise. The characters bonded. The mystery itself was interesting but went down the drain towards the end. The last one , which is this , had me leave it after 15 minutes. It's a Police Drama moving to cult offerings and a continuation which doesn't exist. Amaia , the lead, looks plastic and can hardly be called a detective.
Expected something solid but every sequel was worse than the previous one."
"3016","Offering to the Storm",10,"10/10","If it's a spanish crime thriller movie it's a masterpiece.The story is brilliant, the actors playng is amazing , the suspence and impredictibility are present.This film is boring only for the decervelate public of american craps.At this hour US don't exist on the cinematographic market.The only US productions watchable are the sitcoms."
"3017","Offering to the Storm",2,"Worst soap opera ever","Really guys, this is a soap opera and not a good one... The movie is just for laughs.
If you want to waste more than two hours from your life, then you are free to watch it."
"3018","Offering to the Storm",4,"Too long","(film watched in Spanish using subtitles)
The first film, The Invisible Guardian, offered a great start towards a trilogy based on mystery and mythology. As a viewer, the mythological side kept my curiosity on edge on whether the film would take a slightly fantasy role later but nothing certain was revealed as to validate on a creature known as a Basajaun.(film watched with English dubbing)
The second film, Legacy of Bones, introduced another creature that was new to my knowledge named a Tarttalo, although these creatures began to bare very little importance to the construction of these films. The actors seemed different to me as I watched this second film but, with the dubbing, my first thoughts were that perhaps the voice actors might of ruined this film for me. What did become noticeable was the prolonged music throughout, which seemed to be heard all through the film, that was off putting and irritating on many scenes.(watched film in Spanish using subtitles)
Reverting back to continue watching the trilogy in original language, but using subtitles, quickly became apparent to me that the film was relying on music and actors to dragging this film out. This had all the ingredients to have been a wonderful mythological mystery, combining fiction with suspense and possibly horror with romance, yet failed greater and greater the longer the film went on. Perhaps Oriol Paulo might done a better job on this considering the books have high reviews."
"3019","Offering to the Storm",8,"The entire Baztan trilogy is just great.","All 3 movies are worth your time.Perhaps a little patience with part one, let the story develop, get to know the characters.You won't be dissappointed when you like thriller movies, leaning towards ancient myths and satanism.And don't let the Spanish language hold you back, because there is some occasional English in these movies.The main actors are likeable, good acting as well. Production standards are high, scenery is great (Part 2 with the flooding is very well done).When you are into solid thrillers, a very good trilogy for sure!Comments about being boring probably are by people who like the American scream and I will kill you type of movies.This trilogy (when you get the chance to see them, check on the main actress name and all titles will show of course) just see it. Very good."
"3020","Offering to the Storm",6,"total hollow script but","Independently scenario,adequate production.what if they fill in it by some crosswise plots."
"3021","Offering to the Storm",9,"Wonderfully Brooding and that's just the lead actress!","Wonderfully dark, brooding and deeply atmospheric. The best of the 3 films, pulling together the threads in each one. Wouldn't take much notice of the other reviews, worth watching the first 2 films just to see this one."
"3022","Midsommar",4,"Not for everyone","Let me first say, this is not a ""bad"" movie. It utilizes creative camera work and cinematography to add to the narrative. But I personally still didn't like it. Its main goal in my opinion is to disturb the viewer as much as possible through the use of sound, gory visuals and the feeling of isolation and insanity. While I can see how this can speak to a certain audience, it didn't appeal to me and made me want to turn of the movie quite a few times. If you are into these kinds of films, definitely give this a try but if you, like me, enjoy being scared by a horror movie instead of weirded out and disturbed, this might not be for you."
"3023","Midsommar",10,"Traumatic, Surreal, Bizarre Masterpiece","I'll start this off with a warning. If you're a mainstream horror fan, you will not like this. It is not The Conjuring, it does not have jump scares, it is a slow movie. It's not scary in the way that most horror films are scary. It doesn't frighten you. It felt traumatic. This is an artsy movie for sure. If you don't like that, don't see it.Florence Pugh is absolutely phenomenal. She provides the heart for the film and is what keeps the audience emotionally invensted in such a disturbing film. It's one of the greatest horror performances that I have ever seen.The cinematography is stunningly gorgeous. I've never seen a film look so gory and grotesque and yet absolutely beatiful at the same time. It's some of the best cinematography that I've seen in years. The art direction is also phenomenal in providing us with a floral, candy colored, nightmare world.And Ari Aster's screenplay and direction is what makes this so special and separates it from other horror pieces. It's slow, methodical, eerie. But the characters are psychological and deep. The dialogue is real and colorful. The plot is surreal and disturbing. He let's the scares crawl at you as opposed to jump at you. He allows you to see what will happen, process it, feel the shock of what's about to happen, and then still shock you even more when it happens.This film will be divisive. I have no doubt that many people here will hate this. However, while this is a challenging film, it's also a great film. Halfway through a character says something along the lines of ""That was so messed up, but I'm trying to keep an open mind."" I suggest that audiences take this advice.PSA, this movie is extremely violent, bloody, and gory. It's pretty horrifying and it could have stuff that is triggering."
"3024","Midsommar",1,"Slow burn, Unlikeable characters, and no resolution","As I was watching this I commented several times on the cinematography itself. But even so, I was starved for some sort of narrative. Not to mention, the pacing of the film is so agonizingly slow, I could have walked out of the room at any time and returned to see there had been no progression in the story itself. The characters are all unlikeable, and two dimensional. The protagonist's trauma from the beginning of the film is never addressed again and doesn't contribute anything at all to what little story there was. The film was basically a perfect example of things happening slowly with no climax or resolution but they get away with it because the director decides to put in trippy elements that make no sense to fake the audience out with a false ""deeper meaning"". It's lazy writing, and so much of the violence and nudity was a cheap shot to keep the audience uncomfortable but it was so overused, and abused that they can hardly take these ""unsettling"" elements seriously."
"3025","Midsommar",7,"This movie was a trip","I'm not sure how but the movie had me on edge the entire time. You have to enjoy cinematography to really enjoy this. I left the movie like I just came down from a high. The whole thing felt like a bad trip afterwards, I was pleased and not at the same time but I think that's how we're meant to feel. It's a good change from super hero movies and terribly made horror movies."
"3026","Midsommar",3,"Weird And Pointless","I'm sure I'm missing some higher and deeper meaning to this...
But I just found it to be boring and pointless."
"3027","Midsommar",1,"Cinematography can't save the narrative","This film can't be saved even by the undeniable cinematography. It's unbearably slow, the violence is gratuitous, and it epically fails to be a horror movie on any level. Midsommar tries to be psychologically terrifying/disturbing, but misses the mark because the characters are hollow, and flat.The theater burst into loud laughter at several points because the film becomes so absurd. You stop caring entirely about who dies or how they die, will they live..."
"3028","Midsommar",3,"Long and boring.","All of these best friends seem to hate each other.
There is no interaction between any one."
"3029","Midsommar",NA,"Long meandering story that doesnt deliver","Not sure what this is supposed to be. Its definitely not a horror movie. Its not even that scary, has a few unsettling moments but thats it. Its just weird and doesnt really have any dramatic arc or raising the tension. Basically the whole movie is a few strangers saying WTF? constantly and everyone else telling them "" 'ts ok ! guys""
Also besides that, its revolves around a traumatized, annoying and totally without self respect girl that slowly starts benefiting from this weird place. Because of course, we cannot have a film these days without it being a ""personal journey"" of some sorts. Writers trying to be smart and ""deep"".
Yeah nothing beats a bizzare and crazy rituals to make you sane.If youre expecting horror and monsters or supernatural, keep going. Its just a weird film with no real ending, resolution, interesting character or events. Albeit with nice filmography and quite good actors it has no real dramatic structure or captivating story."
"3030","Midsommar",1,"Atrocious","The only thing scary about this movie is the 2.5 hours of slow torture I sat through"
"3031","Midsommar",1,"Hilarious","The only thing mysterious about this film, is how the director gets away with it...."
"3032","Midsommar",1,"Why is this rated so high on IMDB?? 2.3 hours of wasted life.","2.3 hours of my life I will never get back. One of the stupidest, longest movies with no point. Seriously, I am so upset I had to write a review on how a movie can waste so much of my time. I watched it because initially it had a high review and I trusted IMDB reviews to be somewhat accurate. Seems like this site much be tainted with fake reviews. This movie just plain sucks, don't waste your precious time."
"3033","Midsommar",1,"Style, no substance","I rarely write reviews here. But this movie was SO bad...The opening sequence was very effective. But the next two hours were unbelievably awful, filled with empty cult drivel and scenes that had no connection. It was as if the director had some great ideas for visuals and thought he could put them all together, hoping it made sense. Well, it doesn't. One of the rare movies where I've wanted to yell at the screen, ""This is so stupid!"""
"3034","Midsommar",4,"A uselessly long movie with well made cinematography","This movie was supposed to be about people's feel and need of belonging. An important subject. And how did they deliver it? Two and a half hours of way too long scenes, unnecesseraly gorey violence, and clumsily put together scenes. Violence was not suspenseful, just desgusting. So much, that after a few scenes like that I was more laughing at the whole absurdity of it, than being depressed or scared. Its not a horrible movie, the cinematography and costume design can really be a candy to the eye sometimes. But if you are interested in the meaning of the movie, or you like the kind of suspense it wants to deliver, you can find movies way better."
"3035","Midsommar",1,"Weird movie. Not horror.","I'm struggling to understand why people are giving this good reviews. The movie is so slow and there's not a single horrifying moment in the film. No suspense at all. An absolute drag filled with some of the weirdest scenes you'll ever see. Weird to a level where I couldn't stop laughing while I was watching it."
"3036","Midsommar",1,"Terrible","Quite possibly the most boring film I have watched in a long time.You know it's bad when the audience start laughing at a 'serious' scene.Over hyped like most boring movies. Watch something else. Anything!"
"3037","Midsommar",1,"A load of Swedish meatballs","Who has Ari Aster got dirt on to keep getting money to make films? This is such an obvious Wicker Man RIP that it's not even subtle. The problem is that it has none of the menace, pacing, plot or performances contained in aforementioned classic. Not to mention some of the worst gore effects this side of a troma film and some unintentionally hysterical moments that I'm sure dear Ari mistook for terror. I've seen scarier episodes of Sooty as a kid. Please stay away, he'll only make more otherwise."
"3038","Midsommar",1,"The audiences laughed!","This film is an insult to the horror genre! Just a lot of slow build up to nothing. If you like weird Swedish people chanting to sex and crying, this is your movie!"
"3039","Midsommar",2,"Unsatisfying","Maybe if you are in to mysticism, ocultism. Just maybe. As a Swede i am struggling with a disappointingly non authentic setting, a story i dont know if to take seriously or disregard as uninteresting and, in parts, poor casting.
I doesnt hold. It wont stay."
"3040","Midsommar",9,"An Operatic Catharsis On Emotional Dependency","""I have always felt held. By a family... a real family. Do you feel held?""One of the most universal and innately human desires is a sense of belonging. The human brain is not meant to be alone; we are evolved to be a part of something. Belonging fundamentally allows us to form our own sense of identity, establish social connections through community, and provides us with love, attention, security, and purpose. Perhaps more importantly, a lack of belonging is when we begin to lose sense of ourselves and who we are. This loss of touch with who we are when the world around us suddenly disappears... this slight loss of footing, dip in reality, always feeling somewhat displaced and perpetually unsettled... this encapsulates the mood of Ari Aster's Midsommar.Aster has delivered a psychedelic genre-defying horror fable that wins its audience by creeping into our darkest corners of angst, longing, and loneliness. At its core, the film is about a young woman who copes with crippling anxiety rooted in a desperate and fearful need for love as she comes to terms with the end of a relationship. It's about anxiety, fear of abandonment, and moving on. It is a meditation on human belonging; an operatic catharsis played on the strings of emotional dependency; a journey both inward and outward, to finally let go of something that was never meant to be.Midsommar is not a mystery or suspense movie. It unveils itself unapologetically, as if the filmmaker has no intention of hiding anything from us in the first place (the entire movie is visually depicted almost constantly in the background on walls or tapestries). Yet the film establishes its own rhythm and pacing. As the characters embark on a mushroom trip and grow weightless and spacey, so do we get entranced by the beautiful Swedish settings and sounds-at times indistinguishable from flutes being played by characters on-screen, and at other times, woven with a spell-binding aural hypnosis (listen to ""Attestupan"" without falling into a meditative trip).Like Hereditary before it, the casting is exceptional. Florence Pugh portrays and embodies isolation and anxiety so effectively that the ideas feel nearly concrete. Her part as Dani demands an incredible range and her commitment to the role is apparent. Her character has an air of desperation to her. A perfect casting for a lonely soul. Jack Reynor, a critical piece to this opera as the unlikeable and detached boyfriend, also delivers in a solid performance that leaves us conflicted, or at the very least, challenged.If Satan and Cannibal Corpse got together to shoot Blue Valentine in Sweden, I'd imagine it would be something like Midsommar. Aster taps into a dark and vulnerable place-he opens the door to chests you may have locked away and have had no intention of coming back to. If you've gone through a break-up recently, it may resonate even stronger. It's uncomfortable, unpleasant, but ultimately, cathartic.The director goes on to describe the film as almost a perverse wish-fulfillment fantasy. You see what you want to see. The inclusion of this overarching idea bears a universal relevance to how we can behave in the midst of the most toxic relationships. Entering the ethereal fog of Hårga perhaps a metaphor for willfully indulging in our clouded judgment to escape our fears.If Hereditary was a thematic exploration of inescapable fate, Midsommar is a tighter, more centered thematic reflection on emotional dependence. The thought given to the characters and script and the details within the various shots, symbols, and sounds will all surely leave many viewers coming back for more.Plan to watch it twice, if for nothing else, to drink the tea again."
"3041","Midsommar",1,"What...what?","This is disturbing....this is just a no no! This is not art,this is somebody taking too much drugs...stop it!"
"3042","Midsommar",2,"Director's Cut To Be 30 Minutes Longer - PLEASE, NO!","One would most certainly enjoy this movie after having sampled the same drugs that the characters in the movie ate and drank - otherwise it was a wasted 2 hrs and 27 minutes.I would never have put this movie in the horror genre - nothing scary or frightening about it - unless the whole experience, as a viewer - was abysmal; which is certainly was - then, yes, it was a horror.Full of nonsensical visuals, dialogue, sets, and no discernible plot; ""B-grade movie"" acting; ""nails on the chalkboard"" soundtrack/singing/musical interludes. Cheaply made sets, costumes, ""special effects,"" and annoying film location(s). Furthermore, I'm guessing - poorly paid cast and crew. The disposal of characters in this movie, again, ludicrous preposterous and lame. Howevere, the ""mating"" scenes did bring the theater patrons to rousing rounds of louder and louder laughter; which was repeated, to a lesser degree, through a couple of other scenes.Upon waiting the nearly 2 1/2 hours for the film to conclude with an ending that would lend some credible understanding to the plot, the credits began to roll and the theater patrons began to roll out of their seats, with murmured comments of how terrible and ridiculous the movie was; what a piece of offal that was... waste of time and money.And the writer-director is preparing to add 30 minutes more to this work of art?"

"3072","Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone",8,"The major start of all the magic!","Having read the first few Harry Potter books before 2001 and hearing about the hype for the first movie, I was excited. I heard there was going to be an all-British cast (which makes sense, right?) and we'd get to see a live version of one of the defining novels of our generation. From what I remember I went with my family and a family friend to see the movie the day after Christmas and was pleasantly amazed. After the movie was over, I watched the credits and discovered some familiar names (the late Alan Rickman, Sister Act's Maggie Smith, James Bond 007's Robbie Coltrane, and Star Wars' Warwick Davis); others not so familiar (the kids, some of whom had their debut). But it was a good movie and was a party of colors and sights for all to see. This is easily my favorite of all the Harry Potter films. The catalyst of the movie series!"
"3073","Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone",10,"The Magic Comes To Life!","Once upon a time (and not that long ago), in the vivid, fertile imagination of author J.K. Rowling, a character was born:  A boy.  A young boy named Harry, who was destined to become one of the most beloved characters to emerge from a work of fiction in a long, long time, and was quickly embraced by young and old alike in all corners of the world.  And now, thanks to the magic of the cinema, Harry and his companions fairly leap from the pages of the novel to the silver screen in the phenomenal motion picture, `Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone,' directed by Chris Columbus and written for the screen by Steve Kloves.  Indeed, Harry Potter is a boy, but not just any boy; because Harry (Daniel Radcliffe) just happens to be a wizard.  But, orphaned as a baby, Harry has been raised by his Aunt Petunia (Fiona Shaw) and Uncle Vernon Dursley (Richard Griffiths), who never let him in on the fact that he was, well-- what he was.  It seems that Petunia didn't approve of her own sister-- Harry's mother-- because she was a witch; nor of Harry's father because he, too, was a wizard.  When Harry turns eleven, however, the secret is out of the bag when-- after some strange goings-on-- a giant of a man named Rubeus Hagrid (Robbie Coltrane) shows up at the Dursley's door to collect Harry and take him off to `Hogwarts,' a school for wizards and witches and all who would perfect the gift with which they were born:  The gift of magic!  And from the moment Harry boards the train (from station platform nine-and-three-quarters) that will take him to his destiny, the magic is alive-- for Harry, and for the audience, as well; and it's a journey you will never forget.	What a monumental undertaking to even think of attempting-- translating and transferring this passionately beloved work from novel to the screen. Because to millions of people, Harry and his companions are so much more than merely characters in a book; these are characters for whom people have made a special place in their hearts, which puts a great burden of trust upon the man who would attempt to bring them to life.  And Chris Columbus, it turns out, was the right man for the job.  More than rising to the occasion and with some magic of his own-- and a lot of help from an extraordinarily talented cast and crew-- Columbus has delivered a film that is not only true to the story, but true to the very spirit that makes Harry Potter so special.  The special effects are absolutely beyond astounding, and Columbus, with a keen eye for detail and without missing a beat, keeps it all on track and moving right along at a pace and with a sense of timing that makes this an absorbing, thoroughly entertaining and enjoyable experience from beginning to end.  From the opening frame you get the feeling that you're about to have a singular experience; and you're right. Because you've just entered the world of Harry Potter.  And it's magic.	Even having the best special effects do not a great movie make, however, and this film is no exception; what catapults this one to the top are the performances, beginning with Radcliffe, whom you quickly forget is an actor playing a part.  And that about sums up what kind of a job this young man does here.  Without question, he IS Harry Potter, physically and emotionally, and when he waves his wand and does what he does, you believe it.  A wonderful performance by a gifted actor who has a great career ahead of him; without question the perfect choice for the role of Harry.	Also turning in excellent performances are Rupert Grint as Ron Weasley, and Emma Watson as Hermione.  As with Radcliffe, the casting here could not have been more perfect.  Grint is `Everyboy,' with that special glint in his eye and a manner that makes him especially endearing.  And the spunky Watson adds some real sparkle to the film as Hermione, the one with the sense of urgency and the wherewithal to get things done; a real role model for young girls everywhere.	It's obvious that a lot of care went into the casting of this film, and it's a big part of why it is so successful.  Richard Harris, as Headmaster Albus Dumbledore; Maggie Smith as Professor McGonagall; John Hurt as Mr. Ollivander; Ian Hart as Professor Quirrell.  Exceptional performances from one and all, with two that stand out as especially memorable:  Robbie Coltrane, who readily conveys the fact that Hagrid's heart is of a size that matches that of the man; and Alan Rickman, as Professor Severus Snape, deliciously droll while demonstrating menace through the fine art of articulation.  	The additional supporting cast includes John Cleese (Nearly Headless Nick), Warwick Davis (Professor Flitwick), Julie Walters (Mrs. Weasley), Zoe Wanamaker (Madame Hooch), Tom Felton (Draco Malfoy), Harry Melling (Dudley) and David Bradley (Filch).  From Rowling's imagination to the written page to real life (albeit via the movie screen), `Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone' is a triumph many times over; a unique film of truly universal appeal, the likes of which is as rare as, well-- a sorcerer's stone.  A film in which adults and children alike will rejoice, because it speaks to the heart in a universal language of life, love, experience and imagination; a film that states unequivocally that magic exists-- as long as there's a single child with a single dream somewhere in the world, and real wizards like J.K. Rowling, Chris Columbus, Steve Kloves and every member of this wonderful cast and crew around to bring it to life as they have here.  An instant classic in every sense of the word, this is truly a film for the ages.  A remarkable achievement, this IS the magic of the movies.  I rate this one 10/10."
"3074","Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone",9,"...Welcome to magic world","The breeze stirred the neatly cut bushes of Tisovaya Street, silently lying under the ink-black sky. Of all the streets in the world, this street was the least suitable for amazing events. Harry Potter turned in his sleep. A small hand groped for it and squeezed the envelope. The boy was asleep ... ""(c)June 30, 1997 in the light came the debut of the writer Joan Kathleen Rowling. Literally such words began to become great, a series about a small wizard, with a scar on his forehead. The story that absorbed the minds of adolescents around the world, as it was said in the press ""... a book that can tear boys and girls away from TVs and computers, return it to the house from the street ...""Just imagine...""A dull, dank, dark night. In the street a storm. The little boy lies on the floor of his ""room"", in a small shack and draws a finger in the sand with an inscription, ""Happy Birthday, Harry!"". The cry of the soul, he knows that no one will congratulate him, no one will affably caress the top of his head. In a minute he will be eleven. Ten seconds ... Nine ... You can wake Dudley - just for laughing ... Three ... Two ... One ... A loud knock at the door, there's no knock, just a crash. There was someone behind the door, and he was obviously going to come in. ""I think anyone will guess what happened next. Good-natured giant Hagrid, told Harry the striking news that he is not just a boy with a scar on his forehead, but a real magician.A short word about the actors.HarryWhat to say, there would not be Harry James Potter, there would not be the book itself. Whatever happens in the books, I was always entirely for his character. In the first part, he's just small, you can even tell a confused boy. All situations, difficult fights, intricate situations, are still ahead. Now he just scooped up this great knowledge - magic. The first real home, first friends, first classes, the first meeting with this evil, he is experiencing all this in the first part.
HermioneHermione Jane Granger is my favorite female character in the book and film. In it, I see a part of myself. Hermione loves to learn and she pays a lot of time. Sometimes she is too arrogant and excessively proud of her success in her studies. Born of a muggle, so often heard the offensive word ""Mudblood"" in her address. Hermione is just a smart girl, how many times she has yet to pull friends out of difficult situations.RonRonald Bilius Weasley. Redhead. Already this word can give some characteristic. Ron is the sixth child in a wealthy family of hereditary magicians. Always the elders took on everything superior to Ron, be it study, sport, or female attention. Arriving at Hogwarts, gets to know Harry, the same situation is repeated as with the brothers, but he reconciles with his second plan. Whatever it is, he remains the best friend of Harry and Hermione.I wanted to say that the whole trio was exactly the same as it was represented by millions of readers in the world. Actors took absolutely unknown, but this film made them real little stars.The movie has good enough, more famous actors, the same Maggie Smith, Alan Rickman, Robbie Coltrane, Julie Walters and the inimitable Richard Harris. His death was just a blow to all the fans, his Dumbledore seemed to come off the pages of the book, the same wise look from under the half-glasses, gray hair and beard, hooked nose. He inspired a kind of majestic calmness, every appearance on the screen calming. By the way, I do not consider Michael Gambon a good Dumbledore, he turned out to be some kind of crazy, but this is not on this topic.
It is quite possible to write now a complete retelling of the book / movie, but you know, absolutely do not want to. Joan Rowling created an amazing, magical world, thanks to her, millions of boys and girls began to look for a scar on their foreheads and with impatience and hope to wait for their 11th birthday. And I'm certainly happy about how Chris Columbus embodied this idea on the screen, the fairy tale turned out to be absolutely childish, very bright, joyful and for some reason the word Christmas comes to mind, although there is not so much Christmas there.Children's dream came true. Harry found his friends, his family, found loyal defenders, but he does not even suspect what he will have in the future. However, it will not be soon, but now enjoy watching!Dedicated to: all those who are ready to go with Harry to the end."
"3075","Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone",NA,"As good an adaption as could ever be expected","To be faced with the challenge of adapting Harry Potter for the Silver screen must have been any director's nightmare- the chance of directing possibly the biggest film of this decade, but also the hardest audience-the millions of fans of the book who know every line and will pick up on every mistake. Being one of the above, I can only say that Christopher Columbus and all of the team working on HP did marvelously. The cast was brilliant (particularly notable are Alan Rickman as Snape, Maggie Smith as McGonagall, and the eerily creepy David Bradley as Argus Filch), the directing wonderful, and the scenery perfect. The only qualm is that it does not track perfectly with the book, but squeezed into 2.5 hours, this can only be expected. Well done all involved!"
"3076","Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone",7,"Wonderful adaptation, but missing the satire of the book","I enjoyed this movie immensely. But, like ""The Phantom Menace,"" I've had a very hard time viewing it objectively. There was so much anticipation leading up to its release, I simply enjoyed the experience of being there. Having read all four books in the series a few times each, I am overly familiar with the events in the story. As I watched the movie, my continuing thought was ""How well will the next part of the story be translated to the screen?"" rather than ""How entertaining is this film overall?"" I have trouble answering the latter question because I was already entertained by watching a wonderful story dramatized, so I'll never know how I'd have reacted had I seen this movie without having read the books.Critics talk about how incredibly faithful the movie is to the book, and perhaps I'd have had an easier time detaching the two in my mind had the movie set off on its own course. Indeed, many classic children's movies, like ""The Wizard of Oz"" and ""Mary Poppins,"" are so successful partly because they're so different from the books that inspired them. But these are exceptions; in my experience, most children's movies reveal their weaknesses in how they diverge from the books upon which they're based. And much of what makes the Harry Potter phenomenon unique is that it is the first time in ages that a children's book, without a movie accompanying it, has generated this much popularity. According to an article I read a year ago, the universe of Harry Potter has become as real in the minds of youngsters and adults as that of a popular movie series like Star Wars. Therefore, it will be very hard for any film based upon it to compete with it. In the minds of die-hard fans, any changes made to the story will be seen as desecrating the fantasy world that Rowling created. That's why it's easy to understand why the filmmakers were so reluctant to change anything.As a faithful rendering of the book squeezed into a two-and-a-half hour period, the movie is beautifully done. I don't have a single complaint about any of the actors, who successfully bring to life, with the aid of costume design and special effects, the many colorful characters from the book. My favorite character, the giant Hagrid, is played by Robbie Coltrane, and I say with no exaggeration that he is exactly how I imagined him while reading the book. It's as if they took the image in my mind and transferred it to the screen. While I had my own personal image of Snape (for some reason, I always imagined him as the head villain from another Chris Columbus film, ""Adventures in Babysitting""), Alan Rickman is perfect in the role. I usually expect to have words of criticism for some performances, but I just don't. The remaining adult actors, including Maggie Smith as Professor McGonagall and Richard Harris as Albus Dumbledore, are as good as they possibly could be, and the kids do an excellent job of holding their own against these veterans. Some have criticized Daniel Radcliffe for appearing too subdued in the title role, but that's exactly how the character is portrayed in the book: modest, unassuming, and laid-back. The kids who play Harry's two best friends are flawless.I had a lot of worries about the fact that it was being directed by Chris Columbus, whose entire directorial career so far has consisted of over-the-top slapstick films. I was pleasantly surprised that he did not direct the Harry Potter film in this way. Except for brief moments like the children's delayed reaction to a giant three-headed dog they encounter and Harry's swallowing the quaffle ball, there is nothing here to remind us that this film is directed by the same person who gave us films like ""Home Alone"" and ""Mrs. Doubtfire."" Indeed, I think Columbus may have gone just a tad bit too far in trying not to make the film seem cartoony. I would have liked to see a little more emotion on the actors' faces at certain times. Overall, however, his restraint works nicely in giving the film the kind of believability the book possesses.But much is left out. Harry's caretaker Uncle Vernon, a prominent character in the book, is given less attention in the movie than some of the bit characters. The gently satirical aspects of Hogwarts School aren't in the movie at all. We never see the ghostly history teacher who died several years back but kept on teaching. Lines like the following--""Professor McGonagall watched [her students] turn a mouse into a snuffbox--points were given for how pretty the snuffbox was, but taken away if it had whiskers""--find no equivalent in the movie. The movie does include platform nine-and-three-quarters, though the way the kids disappear into the wall isn't as mysterious as I had visualized, and the sorting hat is there, minus the great poem explaining the differences between the four schools.Not that I'm blaming the movie for omitting some details. Some things from the book would not have translated easily to the screen, and it would have been very difficult to stick everything in. Had Columbus done so and allowed the film to be as long as necessary (eight hours, maybe?), like a BBC miniseries, the film might have been a masterpiece, but few kids would ever have had the patience or attention span to sit through it.The problem is that the amusing details are much of what make Harry Potter such a special story. A whole universe is created in Rowling's series, in which a magical society exists within our own ordinary ""muggle"" world and is kept secret by a bureaucracy with its own rules, history and politics. The way magic is treated in her books, not as something medieval but as very similar to the way our own contemporary world works, is a large part of their charm. Take away these details, and you're left with a fairly conventional tale of a young wizard fighting an evil sorcerer.Although the audience I was with broke into applause as soon as the movie ended (something I've never seen happen before, though I don't go to the theater that often), some people have complained about the movie dragging at certain points. I didn't have that problem, but, as I said, I wasn't really trying to get involved in the movie's story. After thinking about it, it does seem like parts of the movie fail to convey a sense of urgency. Why should this be? I never felt that way when reading the books, and this is without a doubt the very same story.The answer, I think, is that the books portray much of Harry's anxiety in trying to succeed in school (for if he's kicked out, he'll go straight back to his horrible uncle) and fit in with the kids there. The movie doesn't tap into these anxieties enough, so why should we care whether he wins the Quidditch match (other than that he survives in one piece) and gets through the school year? The only real suspense in the movie after he arrives at Hogwarts comes from the story of Lord Voldemort returning, which in the book is almost secondary. Harry's adventures getting along in the school are fun and interesting, but as they are presented to us in the film, there isn't enough tying them all together.What we have here is a serviceable dramatization of a wonderful children's series, but it doesn't entirely succeed in standing on its own. Perhaps it should have diverged from the book just a little, to compensate for the difficulties in translating some of the book's delights to the screen. In its current form, it's almost like a preview of the book. Its lack of fullness, and its dependence on the book, might actually increase the popularity and endurance of Rowling's series by making those who see the film yearn for more, which they can get from the real thing."
"3077","Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone",10,"There's nothing like the first","There's nothing like the first in a series, is there? The introduction to the characters, the immersion into the fictional world, the first time you laugh, cry, care, and fear for someone's safety can never be repeated. No matter how many Harry Potter movies they crank out, or if they ever remake them in the future, none will come close to the wonderful first film, Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone.I'm sure everyone has their own childhood memories of reading the Harry Potter books that they'll tell their grandkids about, but I'll never forget going to see the first movie in the theaters. The lights dimmed, John Williams's perfect theme played its first notes as Richard Harris walked down Privet Drive, and everyone in the theater was transported to another world. John Williams's numerous themes, all wonderful and a personification of the wizarding world, took the early movies to another level. As other composers tried their hands at the later films, that quality was missing. There's something truly special about going to see this movie on the big screen, and while the ""magical"" qualities might not all be credited to the music, it's certainly one of them.Welcome to the world of Harry Potter, where if you're a ten-year-old kid who doesn't fit in, you might get a letter delivered by an owl telling you you have magical powers and should go to a special school to hone them. Believe it or not, there are people who watch this movie without reading the books, so a bit of description is necessary. Obviously the stars of the show are the children, who were selected out of millions of other kids to be able to memorize lines, not look in the camera, endear themselves to worldwide audiences, and hopefully act. Daniel Radcliffe, Emma Watson, Rupert Grint, and Tom Felton are so cute and tiny in this first movie, you'll undoubtedly find yourself re-watching it as the years pass just to see them as kids again. I always marvel that child actors train themselves not to look in the camera, so even if their performances aren't perfect, I cut them slack, knowing firsthand how hard it is. And these kids had to dress in funny costumes, recite incantations without laughing, and pretend they're looking at things that were added in post production!Usually, in kids' movies, there's a grown-up or two who add to the cast and make the adult audience members feel less silly that they're watching it. In the Harry Potter movies, everyone wanted to be in them! Throughout the series you'll see a host of familiar faces as ""guest stars"" but the regulars will make special places in your heart. Richard Harris, Maggie Smith, Alan Rickman, and Robbie Coltrane are household names for little kids, because they're so convincing as the kindhearted Dumbledore, the wizened but sentimental McGonagall, the endlessly mimicable Snape, and the jolly Hagrid, kids today can't imagine they've had any other career prior to these movies! Is there any kid who doesn't immediately attribute the word ""earwax"" to Richard Harris, point out striped cats as ""Maggie Smith cats"", mumble ""Shouldn't have said that,"" when they make a mistake, or practice putting pauses in their sentences like Alan Rickman?First movies are so special, since they introduce audiences to a world that will hopefully capture their attention for however many more movies will be made. In J.K. Rowling's fantasy world, there's so much to fall in love with; and in the film adaptation you can really believe it exists. Seeing the Hogwarts structure for the first time creates a special feeling in your heart that can only be recaptured by watching the movie again or going to see the next in the series. The Great Hall, Quidditch, the Sorting Hat, talking portraits, flying lessons, selecting the perfect wand-all these Harry Potter moments are perfectly recreated in the first of a series that saw an entire generation grow up buying toy wands and trying Bertie Bott's Every Flavor Beans.Each installment has its special moments, and this first one has quite a few, even outside of the exposition. If a three-headed dog doesn't immediately conjure the name ""Fluffy,"" chess pieces have never come to life in your imagination, you don't laugh at the idea of counting your birthday presents, and you don't know what Richard Harris wants most in the world, you're missing out on one of the great joys in life. If somehow 2001 passed you by without a trip to the movie theaters Thanksgiving weekend, go find yourself a copy of this iconic, lovely movie."

"3079","Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone",NA,"Pure cinematic magic","To millions of children of all ages, November 16 has been more eagerly anticipated than Christmas, as the long-awaited film version of J. K. Rowling's beloved novel ""Harry Potter and the Sorceror's Stone"" hits the screen.Each of Rowling's four Harry Potter books have been critically acclaimed worldwide best-sellers, turning a generation of video-game playing children into avid readers.In translating Rowling's world of wizards and magic to the screen, the film makers claimed to be intensely aware of the fans' high expectations and had sworn to be faithful to the book.""Harry Potter and the Sorceror's Stone"" is indeed the most loyal film adaptation of a book that this fan has ever seen.It's the story of an orphaned boy who discovers on his eleventh birthday that his parents were wizards and that he is in fact a famous and powerful wizard himself.Released from the clutches of his desperately ordinary (and non-magical) Uncle Vernon and Aunt Petunia - and their deliciously obnoxious son Dudley - Harry takes his place in the wizarding world as a first year student at the venerated Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry.A great deal of ""Harry Potter and the Sorceror's Stone"" is an introduction to this fantastic and dangerous world and its richly drawn characters. There's not only a lot of plot to cover in this film, but an entire world to create.At two and a half hours long (hit the restroom before it starts), the film includes the book's most memorable scenes, bringing many of them to life with pure cinematic wizardry.The Quidditch match (a soccer/hockey/rugby thing played on broomsticks) is much more exciting on the screen than on the page, as is the bathroom battle with an enormous mountain troll and the larger-than-life game of wizard's chess.The frightening aspects of the book are in full force in the film, and its PG rating (for some scary moments) should be taken seriously.
Screenwriter Steven Kloves (""Wonder Boys"") has done a fine job of streamlining Rowling's tale while maintaining its spirit. Director Chris Columbus (""Home Alone"") makes good on his promise to be faithful to the book. But at times the film is a bit too reverent; you want the actors to cut loose and have a bit more fun.Columbus clearly understands that fantasy works best when it's played most real. Across the board, his fine ensemble of actors are so perfectly cast that they appear to have literally stepped out of Rowling's book.
In the title role, Daniel Radcliffe pulls off the very difficult task of playing an introverted hero who spends most of the movie reacting to the amazing sights and events around him. He beautifully captures the deep soul and untapped potential of Harry Potter. And when this kid smiles the screen lights up.Rupert Grint is delightful as Harry's sardonic buddy Ron Weasley and Emma Watson nearly steals the film as their overachieving friend Hermione Granger. Three cheers to the film makers for giving three unknown child actors the top billing they deserve.The strong cast of veteran actors includes Richard Harris as the wise Headmaster Dumbledore and Robbie Coltrane as the lovable giant Hagrid. Alan Rickman is wonderfully villainous as Professor Snape and Zoe Wanamaker has just the right touch of girls gym teacher as flying instructor Madame Hooch.
As the strict but just Professor McGonagall, Oscar winner Maggie Smith seems born to play the role - and is ready for another Oscar.John Cleese (as Nearly Headless Nick) and Julie Walters (as Mrs. Weasley) have all-too-brief cameo roles, but if the next film ""Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets"" remains true to the book, we'll be seeing more of them.In addition to being highly engaging, the film is a marvelous thing to look at. From the bustling wizard street Diagon Alley to the magnificently gothic Hogwarts School to the dark and misty Forbidden Forest, the film breaks new ground in imaginative production design.To paraphrase the film's tagline, let the magic (and box office records) begin."
"3080","Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone",8,"Valiant, successful attempt to bring the magic to life","We live in a world where economics is hard. This forces practical limitations when making a movie. Time and money are sadly finite, cinema owners need to be pleased as well as fans and computer animation ain't perfect. Given these limitations, this film is about as close to human perfection as it is possible to achieve. However, it's extremely clear what an immense challenge it is to turn Philosopher's Stone from book to film.Two and a half hours is not long to explore a wonderful, magical world. Furthermore, the directors have bowed to the inevitable temptation to show us things that cannot be communicated so effectively in a book. The consequence is the feeling of a slightly breathless sprint in places.It also means that the movie has to stay true to the spirit of the book rather than to the letter of it. There are omissions and there are changes. The changes that were made capture and maintain the spirit of the story really well; indeed, there are places where the story is more clearly and straightforwardly told in the movie than in the book. Some aspects of the story are fleshed out on screen and the additions are delightful, completely in keeping with the flavour of the world.The humour of the movie is inevitably more visual than that of the book; no belly laughs, but a lot of smiles. Some punchlines have changed, but the reasons why the jokes are funny remain the same. Not knowing exactly what's coming next is a good thing! It's all kept tasteful, classy and above the belt; there's nothing to cringe about.The voice acting is almost uniformly brilliant. However, there are occasions where some of the actors are required to convey high emotions and are only given a second or two of face shot, or head-and-shoulders shot, to do so. This isn't as much freedom as they need and they fall a little short. The blame here must fall on the decision to give the actors too much to do too quickly, not on the actors themselves.Other than these rare jarring instances, the physical acting is frequently excellent and seldom less than completely adequate, judged against the highest of targets set by the book's clear emotion descriptions.Dan Radcliffe has the look, the mannerisms and the charm of Harry down pat. His strongest expressions are the bemusement that must be inherent at entering a world where science does not rule alone and the bravery that Harry shows in his achievements. Emma Watson possibly slightly overplays Hermione, but does so in a fully endearing fashion. There's one scene which gives her too little chance to truly express panic; otherwise her performance needs no changes.Rupert Grint has comic timing way beyond his years, hitting Ron's lines perfectly. Tom Felton makes a stylish Draco; Matt Lewis' Neville character suffers from the acceleration, so the finale does come as a slight characterisation shock.The Phelps brothers' Fred and George are distinctively cheeky rather than proactive pranksters; Chris Rankin imbues Percy with genuine authority. Sean Biggerstaff shines; his Oliver Wood is likeable and an ideal Quidditch team captain.Robbie Coltrane's Hagrid is the single dominant adult character, with maximum laughs extracted at every step. The movie changes strongly exaggerate one side of Hagrid's nature, though; probably inevitable considering how much plot exposition his character has.David Bradley has a vicious Argus Filch; John Hurt's Ollivander is an eccentric treat, giving a wonderful introduction to the Wizarding World. The professors are uniformly excellent, though Richard Harris' Dumbledore comes off as disappointingly flat until the end.The most ambitious point of the movie is the computer generated imagery. The stills are wonderful, but the fastest animation is restricted by the limitations of real-world technology. The book makes extremely stringent demands of the CGI; sometimes their overall effect in the movie is merely good rather than insanely great. Some of the magic spells and effects look awesome; others don't capture the imagination nearly so much.The world cannot yet completely convincingly animate human beings doing inhuman things, which serves as a clear reminder that you need fictional magic to make the impossible possible. The Quidditch scene is the most demanding of them all; while the sequence is action-packed and good-looking, disappointingly, it's not a total success. Perhaps some of the scenes would have been better with more conventional special effects? (For instance, the lower-tech-looking Sorting Hat scene is one of the most delightful of them all.)The set looks gorgeous. However, it may not stand up to detailed analysis. It's fairly obvious that things are shot in many disparate locations, rather than one big Hogwarts School near Hogsmeade.The score is absolutely wonderful. The soundtrack may rely too heavily on The Famous Bit, but it's clear that the balance and mixture of things in the finished movie are exactly right.The feel of the whole movie is everything fans could have hoped for. The dialogue is intensely measured, the colouring is suitably epic, the selection of what to leave in is really tightly considered. You get chills in your spine at the right places; you feel the triumphs as all-encompassing endorphin highs. It's clear that the production have thought long, hard and lovingly. They are true fans of the story, they are the right people for the job, it all bodes very well for the second film.So it could never have been the film that the hyper-literalists were hoping for, then, but it is as good as the practicalities of the real world could possibly permit. Don't expect miracles and you'll love it. I look forward to watching it again and again.8/10 at the very least. A really satisfactory film!"
"3081","Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone",NA,"Alohomora - of the magical world...","I watched this movie first time when I was left with no choice. My expectations were extremely low as I always wondered if Harry Potter books were over-hyped. How-ever after watching the movie it did make me a Harry Potter movie fan. And needless to say - this continues to remain my favourite of HP series. That brings to a point here.... the effect of expectations over a movie. True, expectations reduce joy.Without going into the story I would certainly say Chris Columbus churns out a perfect pot-pourri of emotions, suspense and magic, delivering something appealing to all ages.Every character brought to life on screen has done justice and leave an impression on you. Particularly notable performances by Emma Watson and Alan Rickman.CGI are in plenty and made good of. The Quedditch game is picturised amazingly. The wizard's chess is treat to eyes.Let's hope that the forthcoming HP series carries the similar magical touch."
"3082","Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone",10,"It was brilliant!","When I knew the film was being made, I thought how could they make a film that would be up to the standard of such a perfect book. But they did! Sure they missed bits out but they captured the essence of the book brilliantly. One member of the cast was mis-cast for me but my children disagreed.I even found myself believing they were flying and not wondering ""how are they doing that?"" So 10 out 10 Warner Brothers. Bring on the next one!"
"3083","Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone",NA,"Magically Delicious","I feel, next to Willy Wonka and the Chocolate Factory, Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone is the best book-to-movie adaptation that I've ever seen. The sets were stunning - the actors were first rate - the effects were breathtaking.  The film flowed quite smoothly in it's transition from page to screen, never tripping on the awkward conventions that other books on film have struggled with.   The screenplay, by Steven Kloves, stripped away all unnecessary elements to get to the root of the story.  Though many events from the book were excluded, the essential ones made it to the film. And it makes for one smooth story and very enjoyable movie-going experience.Many kudos to Chris Columbus and the rest of the Harry Potter cast/crew for not turning this movie into what it easily could have become:  a 2 and a half hour commercial advertisement for action figures and collectibles, kid's meals and fast food tie-ins, soft drinks and snack products, etc. and instead focused on bringing J.K. Rowling's story to life as accurately and as lovingly as it deserves.  There has been much speculation on whether Columbus was the correct choice for the first two installments of the series and I say to that, Yes.  I feel that he accomplished what most would have failed.  He has proven, at least to me, that Diagon Alley truly exists - if only I could find the right brick to tap on.  The world of Harry Potter is no longer fantasy to me, but instead a place where any of us mere Muggles could hope to visit, one day.One of my favorite moments, is what I'm going to refer to as the Adrenaline Sequence.  By Adrenaline Sequence, I mean the sequence in a movie that for all intents and purposes, doesn't necessarily propel the story, but gives the audience a huge theatrical payoff, ala the Pod Race sequence in The Phantom Menace.  The Adrenaline Sequence for this particular movie is the Quidditch sequence.  I was very happy to finally see the 'hockey/soccer hybrid on a broomstick' come to life.  The Quidditch Sequence is, by far, my favorite sequence in the whole film.  The scene is dizzying in it's violence and it's one breathless moment after another.  My hat goes off to Columbus and his team for succeeding in making this scene as memorable as it should be.Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone is a fantastic movie for children of all ages.  Fans and non-fans alike will enjoy this colorful story of good versus evil and the friendships that endure."
"3084","Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone",8,"Epic film","Ah, the first film adaptation of the beloved Harry Potter series. Harry Potter is an 11-year-old boy who comes to find out that he is a wizard. He lives with his uncaring Muggle (non magic) aunt, uncle, and cousin since his parents died when he was a baby. They were murdered by a dark and powerful evil wizard named Lord Voldemort. Harry would be dead too, but was miraculously saved, making him something of a legend. Upon learning of his guarded magic roots, Harry gets enrolled in Hogwarts- a British school for witches and wizards. While there he learns to come into his own, meet people that are actually good to him, and learn more of his dark past. Looking back, I don't know if it was a good idea to have Chris Columbus direct this, as he does have a reputation for being something of a hack, albeit a decent one. I think his direction is okay here. Yeah, retrospectively it could have been better, but it could also have been much worse. At least with him at the helm we get a good amount of whimsy to go along with a bit of menace, and that's a good thing, as the book was likewise not too heavy on the darker stuff (though that sure changed as time went on). Many liberties are taken, which is weird since the book is quite short, and the film is two and a half hours. It does get the point across decently enough though, and also works as a piece for those unfamiliar with the source material. John Williams provides great music, there's wonderful art direction and set design, and there's some nifty set pieces too. Featuring an all-British cast, this film is impeccably cast, and the performances are good too. Finding decent child actors is hard, but they really scored here. My enjoyment of this movie has waned over time, but it's still not a terrible piece of work by any means, so check it out."
"3085","Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone",8,"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone Review","Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone is a film directed by Chris Columbus. For many years, I hadn't given a damn about the Harry Potter series. But seeing the fanfare surrounded by the series, I decided to give it a try. After watching this one, I can definitely say that I am on the verge of being a fan.Plot: Harry Potter, an orphan living with his uncle and his family is invited to Hogwarts School of Magic to become a wizard.Story and direction: I had watched this part around the time it released but never just kept in touch since I didn't understand a word. Seeing it now as an adult and a movie lover, I just fell in love with this fictional world created. The characters, settings, story, etc.. all just feel seamless. Thanks to J K Rowling, Steve Kloves and Chris Columbus who have done justice to the source material provided to them. I feel the themes are so very relevant in this film. The intricacies of those themes are valid in the current world we do live in. This is what I just exactly want from any story presented to me. Although the film is very long, I never felt bored for a single moment. And to adapt quite a huge novel comes with responsibility and precaution, which the makers completely justified. The sets are huge and awesome. You just feel you are in Hogwarts actually. Also each characters costume is just to marvel at. John Williams once again just proves why he is the composer of the century. But I did feel some flaws to the film. Being a first film, the main plot of the film comes at around the 90th minute of the film. Also the VFX of the film felt very amateur considering some great VFX was done in the years preceding this film.Performances: I would say that the casting of the film is just perfect. Applause for the casting team is deserved. Never do you feel that another actor should play the role. The kids, Daniel Radcliffe, Rupert Grint, Emma Watson, Tom Felon just to name a few are fantastic. These 10-11 year old just steal your heart. Also the other cast like Richard Harris, Maggie Smith, Alan Rickman, Robbie Coltrane make themselves likable.Favorite Scene: There were many favourite scenes in this film for me. But one scene in particular was the troll scene where Harry and Ron decide to save Hermione and after the saving Hermione vouches for the boys. This is the scene where you actually happen to see the bond solidified between the 3 as friends.Verdict: For anyone who just loves fantasy film and worlds with great visuals, this film is just for you. I assure you won't be disappointed. I plan on seeing the entire series now because I am fascinated by this world and want to see what else has it got to offer.I am going with an 8/10."
"3086","Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone",7,"It's a true adaptation, but lacks an edge like the novel. *** (out of four)","HARRY POTTER / (2001) *** (out of four)Here's a method of evaluating a movie based on previously published material: ask yourself if the film makes you want to read the material from which it is based?  Before the release of ""Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone,"" I was one of the few remaining souls who had not read J.K. Rowling's fantasy book series. After screening the first film installment, I did want to read the book. Borrowing the novel from a family member, I briefly skimmed over the chapters. The book's intelligence and similarities with the film really surprised me.  With over 100 million copies sold in over 46 different languages, J.K. Rowling's best-selling series of books has become a worldwide phenomenon. Naturally, with soaring expectations abound, the filmmakers felt great pressure to create a faithful adaptation. They have. This film is essentially a visualization of the words in the novel, with very few differences. That said, the film does run into a few conflicts with the book's story. The middle of the movie has nowhere to go. It's like a false second act; almost nothing of major significance occurs in this period of the film. The young characters wander from scene to scene with nothing much to do and nothing much to say. We're left with a grand display of eye-popping special effects.
""Harry Potter"" certainly dazzles us with a solid beginning and an engaging final act, however. We first meet a young wizard boy named Harry Potter (Daniel Radcliffe). Soon after the film opens, the boy discovers he has magical powers. He's then thrust into an enchanting world of sorcery, magic, and witchcraft. He's sent to a school for young wizard children, where he meets new friends, learns about magic, and participates in fun competitions. But someone at the school doesn't like Harry, as mysterious events begin to occur. Harry soon finds himself in the middle of a diabolical scheme of revenge. Who is the culprit and what do they want with Harry?
The film asks some involving questions. Too bad it doesn't give enough depth to the side characters or subplots. We don't really care about the mystery because we don't know enough about the suspects. The movie does conclude with a twist, but it doesn't encourage another examination of the movie. It lacks a foundation altogether. The story spends so much time foreshadowing the villain's identity, it is pointless for the story to abandon its proceeding plot points and develop a new villain at the end. The book gets away with this; the movie does not. After his gentle ""Home Alone"" and sweet-natured ""Stepmom,"" many questioned the ability of director Chris Columbus to bring a sense of darkness to the story-and for good reason. ""Harry Potter"" contains charming, likable characters and a rich pallet of lush, inventive images. Unfortunately, the film lacks an edge. It's missing the dark atmosphere Rowling's novel so vividly brought to life. Columbus does construct some memorable sequences, but the individual scenes themselves are much better than the movie as a whole.Despite it's childish story and pre-teen characters, many define ""Harry Potter"" as a film for all ages. While that's debatable, during my screening, adults were plowing through the isles every five minutes. Going to the bathroom? Getting drink refills? Buying concessions? Who knows? But not a single child budged from their seat. Their eyes were glued to the big screen. Conclusion: It's a sure-fire experience for children, especially if they've read the books. But adults may not encounter the same enticement as kids. Then again, if I had nothing better to do than to count the people leaving the theater, why am I recommending the film?"

The picture displays stimulating action set pieces illuminating the full-blown adventures , blending wizardry, witchcraft, horror, humor and is extremely amusing and pretty enjoyable. Darkest even that subsequent chapters is thrilling, dramatic, touching and very exciting. Provide enough amusement to keep the chat rooms humming until the epic ending comes out . In spite of overlong runtime, it suffers from over-length, and the difficult of adapting, the film still managing to keep a quick enough pace for those unfamiliar with the literary and highly detailed work by J.

Was I ever wrong? J.K. Rowling's novel was brilliantly taken from book to screen. The acting, directing and especially the special effects were tremendously awesome. Director Chris Columbus did a superb job with the direction, I was surprised he didn't get an Academy Award nomination. The acting was too, excellent, especially from the experienced actors like Alan Rickman playing Severus Snape.

Several little bits were missing, like the absence of the poltergeist which I thought may have been quite fun. But a mystic magical adventure not to be missed!"
"3092","Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone",7,"first year of our magical adventure","While I look back on this first entry into the Harry Potter series fondly it is not with out a few problems with adaption from the books. Our trio of main actors are very young and as a result we get plently of chessey acting. Looking back however it is great too see the beginning roots of the characters that we get very attached too through out the series. We get too see them grow as actors. A great cast was put together that stayed more or less the same through out the whole franchise. The effects in the movie are handled well for its time despite Harry not actually using any magic. Even though there are better movies in the series I will always look forward to watching this entry."

"3094","Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone",10,"Wizard film","In many ways the best of the franchise so far. I was free from any anticipation for this film being not overly impressed by the fantasy genre. This film redeems itself above other sorcery films with its old fashioned English ambiance being greater than arch and portentous fantasy.Unlike other fantasy films the directors face the challenge of a highly critical audience of children who are more familiar with the books that they are & waiting expectantly for their favorite part of the book and would tear the director to ices if he was there in their anger such omissions. Any changes in the film would be seen as desecrating the fantasy world that Rowling created. In the production of the first film this was a contention in preproduction. As a faithful rendering of the book squeezed into a two-and-a-half hour period, the movie is beautifully done as far as special effects go. The actors although experienced are let down by the younger cast not being trained and coming from a stage school background with the exception of the lead show the typical stiltedness of such training. Daniel Radcliffe has been accused of being too subdued in the title role but as he becomes older he character does become more sombre. Alos it allows the other characters oddities to shine more clearly in contrast to his quieter style."

They just said I've seen every movie yet I never saw Harry Potter? Well, I never saw the point since I don't read the books or wasn't interested in the films, it looked like typical kid's stuff to me. But my friends said they would not take me to see the movie until I've seen the films, it's now that I realize I got myself into trouble since these movies are all 2+ hours each. I just finished the first one a couple days ago.Harry Potter lives with an extremely cruel family, but there is something different about him, he can talk to snakes and make things appear and disappear. Well, he receives a letter, he's a wizard! Not just any wizard, he is the only wizard ever to survive the wrath of Voldemort, the most wicked wizard. Harry goes to a magical school, Hogwarts, where he learns the truth of his heroic parents and meets two other wizards, Ron and Hermione who soon become his best friends and they discover the power of the sorcerer's stone and what might happen if it's put into the wrong hands.Harry Potter I have to admit is off to a good start with me, it had wonderful and magical effects that anyone could enjoy. The actors were just so perfectly cast, Maggie Smith, Alan Rickman, John Cleese, we have some of England's most brilliant actors. It's a well made film, now I still haven't read the books, so I can't base this film on a comparison. Even if I did, this is the movie and the movie itself is a magical and enchanting experience. Well, I'm onto The Chamber of Secrets, wish me luck.7/10"
"3096","Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone",6,"A sad excuse for a children's movie.","Lacking any real magic, Harry Potter was a lifeless film, composed of a plotless story and forgettable performances. While watching the Neverending Story last night, a true children's classic, it really hit me how wonderful a movie Harry Potter could have been if only they'd been willing to deviate from the book for a second.I give this long, convoluted mess 1 out of 10."
"3097","The Invisible Man",4,"Starts brilliantly but ultimately undermines itself with plot contrivances and genre foolishness","H.G. Wells's original The Invisible Man (1897) suggests that rather than something as powerful as invisibility being used for the betterment of mankind, it would instead be used to fulfil private desires, ultimately leading to the moral corruption of otherwise good men. In probably the best cinematic adaptation, Hollow Man (2000), this is taken much further, with the suggestion that the results of invisibility would be nothing less than sexual violence, evil, and madness. However, despite the centrality of this theme in the core story, reframing the template as a tale of domestic abuse and PTSD, as happens in this latest adaptation, which focuses not on the male scientist but on a female victim of his, is a fascinating idea, creating the potential for some timely #MeToo social commentary, particularly as it relates to issues of not believing women who accuse powerful men of gaslighting. But potential only gets you so far, and what could have been a really insightful film eventually proves itself relatively incapable of using issues of domestic abuse as anything other than plot points to get from one predictable scare to the next.The film begins as Cecilia Kass (Elisabeth Moss) is putting into motion a plan to leave her domineering and abusive boyfriend, Adrian Griffin (Oliver Jackson-Cohen), a wealthy pioneer in optics. Having drugged him, she leaves their high-tech home in the middle of the night and is picked up nearby by her sister Emily (Harriet Dyer), who takes her to stay with their childhood friend, James Lanier (Aldis Hodge), a policeman living with his daughter Sydney (Storm Reid). Although assured that Adrian can't find her, Cecilia is clearly suffering from agoraphobia and paranoia. That is until Adrian commits suicide. Contacted by his brother Tom (Michael Dorman) who's handling his estate, Cecilia learns that Adrian has left her $5 million. However, despite her best efforts to move on, she just can't shake the feeling that Adrian is still around, watching her, sometimes even in the same room as her. And the surer she becomes that he's not dead, the more everyone else becomes worried about her mental well-being.Written and directed by Leigh Whannell, this latest adaptation of Wells's original is not actually about the invisible man. Indeed, short of a background shot of him lying in bed, a shot showing only his torso as he runs through a forest, and a close-up of his hand, actor Oliver Jackson-Cohen doesn't even appear on screen prior to his apparent suicide. Adrian is not only the invisible man of the plot, so too is his character ideologically invisible. Which makes its own statement, and it's a statement worth making - men like him don't need to be present to continue to cause harm. In this sense, at least initially, the film is more concerned with the fear Adrian has instilled in Cecilia; in the early stages, Cecilia's main enemy isn't Adrian so much her inability to move on from him. Along the same lines, the film looks at issues of how women who accuse powerful men of gaslighting are often ignored or openly disbelieved.Aesthetically, the film looks terrific, particularly Stefan Duscio's cinematography, into which is built Cecilia's paranoia. For example, countless scenes involve the camera panning away from her, moving across the room, showing us nothing at all, and then panning back. Ordinarily, this would be textbook unmotivated camera movement, but here it conveys how Cecelia fears there may be something in the corner to which we panned. And now, thanks to that camera pan, so do we. There are also many shots which in another film would be awful framing; isolating Cecilia in the frame and filling up so much of the screen's real-estate with empty negative space. Except, again, in this film, such negative space has an ominousness not applicable to regular thrillers. In this way, Whannell can instil fear and dread simply by pointing the camera at an empty room without the need for any FX, VFX, makeup, elaborate props etc (which no doubt played a significant role in keeping the budget down to a minuscule $7 million). And I'd be remiss if I didn't mention Moss's performance, which is excellent, especially given that so much of it is her on her own reacting to nothing whatsoever, having to communicate confusion, fear, anger etc through little more than her expression.Before talking about why I didn't like the film, however, I want to reiterate that I honestly can't say how much I admire the idea to reconstitute the genre template as a story about domestic violence. And it's an especially timely reconstitution, coming as it does in the era of #MeToo, when so many powerful men, once considered invisible in everything but name, able to perpetrate their crimes with impunity, have been revealed as the monsters they are. So I have no problem with the ideological paradigm shift. My problem is with the execution.For one thing, we know from the get-go that Cecilia isn't imagining things, that Adrian faked his suicide and is now stalking her whilst invisible. This isn't a twist, and the film makes no attempt to hide it. Granted, this is kind of unavoidable given how well-known the property is, but had the film allowed for even a little bit of ambiguity, it could have done wonders for emotional complexity, turning a story about invisibility into a story possibly about mental collapse. This would have effectively placed the audience in the same position as the other characters, doubting Cecilia's state of mind, which would, in turn, have enhanced the potency of the socio-political allegory. Another thing that bothered me is that in a film so focused on surveillance and privacy, there are several scenes where if there is even one functioning CCTV camera, the movie ends. A pivotal scene in a restaurant is an especially egregious example of this - one grainy image from a camera, and Cecilia can prove she's not going nuts and the whole plot unravels.However, my biggest problem is that what starts as a fascinating study of the lasting ramifications of domestic violence ultimately descends into genre stupidity, with a ridiculously over-the-top final act that says nothing of interest about anything. True, Hollow Man has a pretty over-the-top final act too, but Hollow Man never saw itself as anything other than a schlocky genre affair, whereas The Invisible Man clearly does. The fact that Whannell ultimately undermines himself in this way, deploying such important themes merely to get him to the gory dénouement, is especially frustrating insofar as he genuinely did originally seem to have some interesting things to say. Tied to this is that Adrian is introduced as such an abhorrent character from the start, void of nuance or subtlety. Domestic abusers aren't monotone evil-doers, oftentimes, they're very charming on the surface, and any film claiming to be a serious examination of this topic would make room to address this.Although The Invisible Man was very well reviewed and a huge box-office hit, it left me disappointed and frustrated. Initially positioning itself as an insightful allegory for the difficulty victims of domestic abuse have in moving on with their lives even after the abuser is gone, it eventually privileges genre beats and cheap thrills over emotional complexity. Which is a huge shame and a massively missed opportunity."
"3098","The Invisible Man",3,"Plot holes...you bet","I'm sorry but at times I just don't understand the reviews on this site. There were soooooooo many plot holes it just ruined what other wise could have been a half decent film. I'm afraid that a good film can easily be ruined when the narrative simply doesn't follow and this is one of those cases."
"3099","The Invisible Man",1,"Who paid these other reviewers?","7.5 rating on here I thought this would turn out to be a pretty decent movie. What I got instead was a boring mess. Zero character development, no emotional connection to the main characters to make you care what happens to them. Do yourself a favor and find something else."
"3100","The Invisible Man",1,"The only thing truly invisible in the film is quality.","Mediocre thriller filled with illogical plot holes. The first third of the movie is marginally alright. After it transitions into a sci fi comedy, with the main protagonist playing John Wick, while the main antagonist plays an inverse Bruce Wayne. In this fictional universe, security guards are apparently trained at a bakery. Cameras make no sound whatsoever. Are amazingly waterproof and stain-phobic. Not even paint can stain those. Little girls have a 6th sense for rape and murder. The penetration of a can of pepper spray is equal to that of a cannon ball. Physical objects are ephemeral in nature when it comes to rain drops hitting them. I mean, god damn, i need to get me a set od those god like cameras. And Nat Geo should too, probably.This movie is not even good for making fun of, if you wish to watch a dumb movie with your friends and have a good time - go watch As Above So Below."
"3101","The Invisible Man",1,"Hollywood takes us for chumps","I can't begin to convey how bad this thing is. Elisabeth Moss spends the entire movie looking like she has to use the bathroom. The scenes are too long and the music is way too loud and overwhelming. Bottom lime is Hollywood makes another reboot that stinks up the joint. Total waste of time. Can't hold a candle to the original. Make this movie invisible!"
"3102","The Invisible Man",5,"Barely just ""okay""","The Invisible Man ... hmmmm. Well, it wasn't awful, but it wasn't great. I still don't understand what house she went to, her relationship with the two people that live there, and why it never occurs to her to use the camera on her phone to record video for evidence.In today's world, films really need to go out of their way to explain a LACK of smartphone use. They are so prevalent that NOT using them is a plot hole, and not a small one. It really kind of irritates me.There is one legit good jump scare and some good tense moments. But for the most part it just feels like a real wasted opportunity.I hate to say it, but Hollow Man did it better."
"3103","The Invisible Man",2,"Amazingly Bad. Rubbish. Awful. Unrealistic.","It honestly makes me sad that we live in an era where a poorly written screenplay like this gets such high praise. I don't even know where to begin to express how bad this film was. I wanted to walk out with 30 minutes left and I never do that. Just when you think the pain is going to end and the movie is over, there is an additional 4th act to add to the absurdity!The lead does a decent job acting in this film but hard to not get a bunch of filth on you in the process.Honestly, do we live in an era where people have stopped thinking and just want to go to a film and zone out and not require it to be good anymore or have a good story?Stay away from this trash."
"3104","The Invisible Man",9,"It's Plain to See That This is an Excellent Thriller","""He said that wherever I went, he would find me, walk right up to me, and I wouldn't be able to see him.""I probably yawned and rolled my eyes when I first heard they were rebooting The Invisible Man. This idea had been done and done and done...right? Wrong! Director Leigh Whannell breathes new life into the concept. Now it's a vehicle for Elisabeth Moss, as Cecilia, who is in every scene and steals them all.Sound and vision are used to keep you on edge. Is Cecilia suffering a mental breakdown because of her abuse...or is there an invisible man following her? Moss and Whannell squeeze every ounce out of this scenario and it all works. This movie even sidesteps the science missteps of earlier versions with an updated version of the character. Though very different from the book by H.G. Wells, I feel like he would approve."
"3105","The Invisible Man",NA,"The Invisible Man's Wife!","An interesting modern take on the invisible man concept in this twisted mind game nightmare yet it comes with the lack of the invisible man presence! An abused wife escapes her narcissist and sadistic husband to her friend's house only to know after a couple of weeks that he committed suicide, in what seems like a happy ending for her turns out to be hell as she feels her husband's presence around here almost everywhere which leads her to suspect that he's still alive and won't let her go this easy.So far the idea sounds interesting but for a general thriller, not revival of a classic, I believe the plot should've been approached with more of a homage to the classic adaption. I know the idea of taking chemical potions to become invisible is over used but a plot mix between modern technology and past methods would've been a better choice, I already have couple of ideas on how to do so just by writing this.Elisabeth Moss carries the movie well, yet the movie feels more like ""The Invisible Man's Wife"" story more than being The Invisible Man story! Practically almost the whole movie is focused on the wife, her mental suffering and what she's going through, you can barley see/sense any character development or acting from the invisible man at all. Some scenes are very predictable like you can almost see through but it's a nice piece of a (general thriller) for the most part."
"3106","The Invisible Man",1,"Do you enjoy horror? You wont enjoy this.","This is one of the worst movies I've seen in years. I dont understand the good reviews, I saw the trailer and got excited, I read the reviews and I got even more excited.. I saw the movie and Jesus, not scary at all and the story was just bad.. This is a sci-fi, not a horror movie.."
"3107","The Invisible Man",1,"Worst movie of the year so far","I just got back from a nearly empty theater in order to see this, and I wish I hadn't paid. I don't even wish I'd illegally downloaded it, I wish it were never made so I was never tempted to see it. Hollow Man was better, and that's a sad statement. Who in the hell is rating this positively? There was no 'there' there. No backstory on ANY of the characters, not a single memorable line delivered, and not even an explanation for the so called science fiction aspect of this. On top of that a highly unbelievable story about domestic violence in which we are to believe that a handsome, rich genius is somehow in love with and obsessed with Elizabeth Moss of all people. Leave her to the Handmaid's Tale, she is not meant to be a romantic interest. She got lucky on this because of her origins. Her acting was the usual. I get it, this is supposed to be a horror, but it wasn't even that. Just typical 'made ya flinch!' moments that weren't even that because it was so gosh darn predictable. The positive ratings must be from people who were just glad for the diversity and glad to see yet another white guy cast as a villian (which gets no explanation at all, not even a flashback to what he did that was so horrible. To the point where at the end you can't even be sure he was a villian at all). I was sure a woman wrote this at the end, but I was disappointed to see it was the guy who did Saw. That was at least entertaining. This was embarrassing.Shame on all of you who voted this up. We shall get more of the same as Idiocracy becomes more of a documentary than a ridiculous fiction movie."
"3108","The Invisible Man",1,"Don't waste your money.. rent Hollow Man instead","Slow start, slow middle, slow ending. Even the attempt at throwing in a twist couldn't help this movie. I haven't been that bored watching a movie in super long time."
"3109","The Invisible Man",1,"Joke","Read the reviews here before heading to the movie. Walked out after 30 minutes. I mean seriously, Moss in the lead role? No explanation who are the characters Moss went to live with. She is as expressive as Mona Lisa. How can this movie be so highly rated here? I feel cheated with my hard earned money."
"3110","The Invisible Man",3,"Nothing To See","A woman furtively leaves her marital bed at dead of night in a hill-top, bay-view, hi-tech luxury mansion. She gets away from her soon-pursuing husband by the skin of her teeth and we soon learn in the aftermath that said husband was a control-freak, obsessively watching her every move. And if you look carefully, also that he's seriously into optics and the like, remember that, it's important. Next thing, she's told by hubby's lawyer brother that he's been killed and she's been left his fortune. So she moves in with her cop pal and his college-age daughter and in relief, starts splashing the cash, but somehow she just can't shake the feeling that her old man is still around and actually isn't dead at all.From this set-up, the film could really have gone one of two or three ways, either as a realistically presented psychological thriller with her out-of-sight ex using his power and influence to disrupt her life while keeping well away from her, or even as a study in paranoia with the wife suffering some kind of breakdown and just imagining all the crazy things happening to her. Or, it could of course go the full H.G. Wells and set the psycho-spouse up as a mirror-suited (remember what I said about his interest in all things optical?) killing-machine, rendering him invisible, out to get her back under his control which plan he puts into motion by firstly framing her for the murder of her own sister just for starters, as you would. Guess which way it goes?So sure enough we get all the cliched, seen-'em-before silly-looking scenes of people fighting and getting beating up by an invisible enemy and lots of static, subjective camera-shots looking at inanimate objects and inviting the viewer to join the connecting dots.Elisabeth Moss as the persecuted wife, gets to bring out her scared, angry and mad faces as the body count increases and the situations become even more ridiculous and predictable. Not that she takes all the mayhem happening around her lying down, oh no, she sure enough overcomes her terror, finds her inner Sarah Connor and decides to fight back leading to a final reckoning back at their old house. For me, she does a good job of staying in character without once breaking out into fits of laughter at all that's going on, especially when her stalker turns out to resemble a now-you-see-him, now-you-don't super-villain running around in a costume that, when revealed, makes him look like a shiny Spider Man.I just found it all very predictable, weakly-characterised, mildly absurd film entertainment. For one thing, I thought the editing poor with jumps to scenes with little or no explanation. Once I sussed how the film was playing all the carefully arranged attempts at dramatic tension evaporated so that I couldn't even be bothered to shout ""He's behind, in front of, to the left or right of you or wherever he was!"" at the screen.Sorry, with its transparent characters and see-through narrative, I just couldn't see what all the fuss was about here."
"3111","The Invisible Man",1,"Was expecting at least a little more","Very poor. slow and tedious.
how this film has received a score in the 7+ range is beyond me.
i'm starting to believe that some of the ratings on imdb are faked
and probably placed by a bot."
"3112","The Invisible Man",1,"An Honest Review","I haven't really seen an Invisible Man movie that I could say was good. So I had low expectations walking in.The one with Chevy Chase was horrible. The one with Kevin Bacon was tolerable... but I wouldn't say it was particularly good. This one, however, was awful.But at least it hit all the tropes... not sci-fi/horror tropes, but it hit all the political tropes. And, honestly, I got sick of political lectures in my entertainment about four years ago and they are only getting worse. Movies like this are made to be escapism, if I wanted to see a political film, I'd watch one that overtly claims to be a political film.Movies like this also rely on tension and scares. And tension needs to be built through atmosphere. It needs to be built through character and story, and if it is done right it can be a slow burner of a film that is still entertaining.There was really no tension here. The characters were created to be political representations of the narrative they were pushing and not real characters. It makes it hard to be invested in the well being of a character when they are just stereotypes.It takes away from the tension.Walking stereotypes of what the Twitter community thinks they should be based on race, gender, and sexuality and not real people. Who can become invested in characters that are stereotypes?It's a situation made worse because the villain isn't ominous and intimidating, he isn't threatening at all. He's the stereotype of what the Twitter community thinks is an Incel... and there is nothing at all threatening about that. Watching him, you get the impression that you could break him down into a basket of tears with nothing more but a harsh word.When the tension is broken, it's with a jump scare. Those are as overdone as the stereotyped political agenda driven characters.When all is said and done, you have a movie without the tension needed to move the film along, you have a movie with stereotyped characters that it's hard to get invested in, you have a movie with a villain that is anything but threatening, and you ultimately have a movie where nothing much happens.But, if you are the type to watch a film with a notebook and writing utensil to record all the points it needs to hit to make it Twitter posse approved... it hits enough of them for high praise.For the rest of us, we'll go back to Chevy Chase and Kevin Bacon and be slightly less disappointed."
"3113","The Invisible Man",NA,"Hard to watch","The main character was beyond stupid In this whole movie
Time and time again
She kept not doing things
That made the whole movie frustrating to watch
I won't spoil anything on what those things were
But this movie was painful
I have no clue why it's rated so well
And how people got enjoyment out of this crapI will never tell someone not to watch something
But I certainly won't say I enjoyed itThere were a few scenes that were cool
And the Concept of things was intriguing
But not enough to save the film"
"3114","The Invisible Man",6,"Loses it's way halfway through","This is a film about an abusive relationship and what is does to the tormented, well... except it's not. Around halfway through the story turns away from a suspenceful psychological thriller and shapes itself into a rather generic, mainstream, twisty and predictable piece.After seeing this I thought the movie works because of Elisabeth Moss's work as lead actress. Her Cecilia is present in almost evey scene and her acting range, her connection to the character and her talent is what elevates this film a couple steps above your typical low-budget thriller. Also speaking of budget, the film is VERY good looking for just a 7 million. I've had some fun with this, I wish it could have gone a different path but it's what it is I guess."
"3115","The Invisible Man",8,"As good as a modern Invisible Man movie can be.","Leigh Whannell is not a subtle filmmaker - at least, that's what I used to think. The Saw and Insidious movies are over-the-top and shocking, which is fine, and I enjoyed Upgrade quite a bit, but I was afraid the Invisible Man would fall into the same trap of shock-value over substance. Thankfully, I was wrong.From the opening scene, the movie sucks you in with tension and unease. Cecilia (Elizabeth Moss) is trying to escape from her abusive boyfriend while he is asleep, and with practically no dialogue or exposition, we immediately understand the situation and feel for Moss' character. She's trapped in an abusive relationship and fears for her life. It's a testament to Whannell's deliberate direction, using visual cues to give us the information we need while slowly ratcheting up the suspense. The movie is not reliant on jump scares. There are a few, but they're 100% earned and actually effective because we care about the characters. The excellent score helps add to the atmosphere, alternating between pulsating ambience and melancholy orchestral bits.From the concise writing, likable characters, clever directing, a powerhouse lead performance, and a genuinely scary villain, The Invisible Man gets just about everything right. I suppose you could nitpick some of the logic, but that's missing the point. It's a film about gaining freedom from a toxic relationship, and Whannell knows exactly how to pace the story so that we don't spend too much time dwelling on potential plot holes. Overall, a gripping and expertly crafted psychological thriller."
"3116","The Invisible Man",9,"Great","I loved this movie so much. I loved Elisabeth Moss's performance if her acting didn't work then we wouldn't believe there is an invisible man but she sells it. I like the cinematography in the movie, I love it when they move the camera to a random spot in the room and we think the invisible man is there and them kinda showing he's somewhere in the room with her, which creates a lot of tension in the scenes. I love the tension in each scene and they do a very good job of capturing tension throughout the whole movie. They have an absolutely stacked cast and they all do an amazing job. I think they did a pretty job at the score it really worked in the tension of the scenes and it elevated each scene and the whole movie and it flowed with each scene it never felt off at all. I felt so bad for the character of Elisabeth Moss because the evidence is right there and the doctors aren't believing her, and everything that happens to her too. They do an amazing job at fleshing out the character of James who is played by Aldis Hodge he also does an amazing job and I cared about him so much throughout the whole story. The story kept me on the edge of my seat from start to finish, and it kept me wanting to learn more or see what was going to happen next. I only have two problems with the movie a bit of the dialogue is bad at times and there are times where the decisions that were made were not logical at all besides that I think it is pretty good. Overall I loved it and would recommend it to anyone."

"3119","The Invisible Man",9,"Leigh Whannell crafts a visceral thriller with a new updated take on the classic story.","WHANNELL has been in my opinion one of the most underrated director /writers for a long time. He was mostly behind the insidious and saw franchises And came out with the spectacular futuristic thriller upgrade in 2018. His brilliant style is once again back with full force in this new adaptation of the invisible man. many people will just look at this like another Blum house manufactured film at first but realize that just because it has the production name on it doesn't mean it will be another throwaway film. This film much like upgrade thrives with a crisp smart script and fantastic visuals. Whannell has a keen eye for detail and it shows in bunches in this film. Elizabeth Moss also gives a phenomenally dedicated performance And sheds emotion throughout. There are many moments in this vicious film that you will not see coming and I was actually surprised by the amount of brutality which serves the overall story well. This is a new take on a classic universal monster that you will not want to miss and it's definitely worthy of going to see in the theater unlike many films of late."

The problems the characters face are totally unrelatable to 99% of the population. It is as if the creators have been stuck in a time machine and still believe going to college and fulfilling our parents expectations are still relevant problems. They are, but they have been rehashed hundreds of times in the past.The only forgiving things this movie has going for it is it is midly entertaining.

He says wanna be and do what he badly wants to but no one has a clue what it is. No passion or direction in him. Actually it needs to be said that he is on a route to discover the real himself without any external supervision. It also referfs to many of the other 17-y-o pseudo adults who have to make life decisions but actually are on their way to know who they are and what wanna do in their next decades of life. In case of youngsters who had specific interests and talents visible for years then it is much more easier and their direction is not that vague ... at least it's what is seems cos life can bring many surprises.
He difinitely needed a mentor who could show him some directions and help in understanding many difficult life issues.

Quality.
With an interesting script.
How many of us have wanted to break the system?
Were we teenagers how many times we question the authority of our parents?
The interesting thing about this film is that it shows both the position of the son (who is the one who tells the film) but also the position of the parents.
How many times do parents want life for their children that they don't have?

This movie try to say that we look for or true future not the one that we are suppose to do. Okay, it's not easy, not alll the people can do it because of the money but, at least you have to know what do you really want to do and if you have the change, do it. That's what this movie is about. It has problems, cliches and there are only room for the main character more or less but, it entreteins and send a messege, an important one in my opinion."

It truly shows what some kids go through; pressures, stress, and venturing out into the unknown.I'm 33 and quite cynical, but this movie really played with my heart strings.

It is my favorite time travel sci-fi, adventure epic comedy in the 80's and I love this movie to death! When I saw this movie I was thrown out by its theme. An excellent sci-fi, adventure epic, I LOVE the 80s. It's simple the greatest time travel movie ever happened in the history of world cinema. I love this movie to death, I love, LOVE, love it! I firstly saw this movie in the early 90's as a kid on VHS tape and I was blow away by the action and the score and the title back to the future. This movie is one of the best masterpiece time travel epic adventure film. Michael J. Fox and Christopher Lloyd are fantastic at acting. Music theme score by Alan Silvestri is excellent I could listen to it whole day.Back to the Future (1985) From the Academy Award ""- winning team of Steven Spielberg"" and Robert Zemeckis** comes the hilariously groundbreaking adventure that thrilled critics and audiences alike - and sparked one of the most successful movie trilogy ever! Directed by Robert Zemeckis the movie begins with Marty McFly (Michael J. Fox) a teenager who has a really messed up family. His ultimate goal was to become a rock star which was heartened by his girl friend Jennifer Parker (Claudia Wells). But things went wrong when scientist Dr. Emmett Brown/Doc (Christopher Lloyd) wanted Marty's assistance for his new invention.At that night Marty went to assist Doc's invention the Time traveling Car ""DeLorean"". Marty was told to record Doc's first time travel to the future. At that instant they were attacked by some Libyan terrorists who were cheated by Doc for Plutonium.After killing Doc they turn towards to Marty and without any intention Marty enters the Time Traveling car. But it was previously set by Doc and when activated Marty gets transfer to 1955 from 1985.What will he do next, will he can come back to the future, or will he stuck back in the past for his rest of the life. More than that will his time travel make serious effects on the future? Dealing with time travel and time paradox Steven Spielberg presents this amazing journey of Marty set up in the time of 80's and 50's. Scripted by Robert Zemeckis and Bob Gale for the story of Bob Gale himself, tells a science fiction adventure in a family oriented tone.They really work hard to sculpt that sci-fi thread into a thrilling, culture clashed family movie. A good story with a great script. Also the soul of the movie was given by the legend Alan Silvestri. His composition was all memorable especially in the chasing and emotional scenes. Over the top the theme music, it was the most dazzling and recognizable themes in the movie history.More than that the casting was simply brilliant, each and every actor is born to play their respected roles in this movie. Michael J. Fox was the only actor who can play the role of energetic Marty McFly, which was considered for numerous actors. Also Thomas F. Wilson was brilliant in his performance as the Bad boy Biff Tannen. Lea Thompson did a great work in portraying Lorraine Baines's two different life times, as a teenage girl and a matured mother. Well the extra talented Christopher Lloyd had almost ""chewed every scenes"" in the movie. Mr. Lloyd's versatile performance as the madman and genius scientist Dr. Emmett Brown is one of the great memorable roles in his carrier.Last but not the least, it was Crispin Glover who steal the show as the nerdy teenager/father as George McFly. It was an interesting portrayal as a boy who was transformed to a man. Crispin Glover lived in that part. I don't know whether the movie would be a masterpiece without his unique performance. Above all I want to remember this as a romantic movie and it couldn't be made without the songs ""The Power of Love,"" and ""Earth Angel"".The rating I am giving is 10/10 the original and the best one of all time. I love this film, it is my favorite time travel movie of all time and I love it to death! All in all it is the greatest sci-fi, romantic movie of all time. It is the part of the great Movie History, which consider itself as "" A Modern/Classic Masterpiece! """
"3148","Back to the Future",NA,"You gotta come back with me...","Back To The Future (1985) is my all time favourite movie. It's a thoroughly feel good film, accessible to all ages and enjoyable from the 1st to the 45th time of watching and never fails to bring a smile.  Humour for all ages and a kick-ass car to boot, what more could a young kid want? Or those young at heart?From Marty's ""Johnny B Goode"" to Doc's classic ""Run For It Marty!"" You'll find that even though you know what's coming next, you'll still laugh. It is the ultimate feel good movie, the weed overcomes the bully, the dreamers wishes come true and all because a nosey old bird thrusts for a nickel ""Save The Clock Tower!""It's popularity spawned 2 sequels and although it got decreasingly good in terms of quality as a film, Back To The Future remains the best film in my repetoire and a safe bet when you need to feel good.It gets a solid 9 out of 10, comedy, fantasy, the gorgeous Lea Thompson, the insane but comic Doc and the typical teenager Marty make this film a must for all young at heart."
"3149","Back to the Future",10,"How could anything be more fun than this?","Back To The Future is such an inventive and exciting piece of filmmaking that it is impossible to forget about it. The casting of every character involved was absolutely perfect, and the performances were spectacular. I first saw this film when I was six years old, and it is the only movie that I know of that I don't think I could ever get sick of.
One of the best things about Back To The Future is that it really makes you think. You can have in-depth conversations about the plausibility of the story-line and spend hours discussing the film. The story is awesome, it is delivered cleverly and entertainingly, and the movie as a whole is just so much FUN that it can be forgiven whatever number of time-travel discrepancies that may be found in the plot. I cannot recommend this movie enough. I have never found a movie other than this one that provides such a huge dose of great fun, and it has the desirable quality where you are able to see something new each time you see it. The only problem is that they stopped at part III."
"3150","Back to the Future",NA,"A Time -Travelling Classic","Zemeckis's 'Back To The Future' trilogy has been a childhood favourite for a long time. Having revisited it today, brought me to a nostalgic state. The 80's saw a lot of excellent original fun 'young' films like 'Back To The Future' (of course), 'Better Off Dead', 'Heathers', 'The Breakfast Club' etc. What really made these films immensely enjoyable then, and classics today, is that they really reflected what it was like being a young person in the 80s. The movies themselves were well written, well executed, well acted and they cut straight to the point.Back to 'Back To The Future'. This one is sheer fun, even today. There's an incredible energy about it but it still manages to stay an 'innocent' film. The music is very effective. It's slick and follows a steady pace. The special effects are decent. Though people might pick on the plausibility of the time travelling, I think this is really a very minor flaw because it is overall a well written movie and the point was to entertain. Yet, this is not to say that it's brainless entertainment. I think it cleverly brings forth some interesting themes and I liked how they funnily used some ideas of Oedipus Rex's story.The acting is superb overall. Christopher Lloyd as the over-the-top mad scientist is a laugh riot. Michael J. Fox totally owns Marty McFly with his natural charisma, raw energy and brilliant dialogue delivery. Lea Thompson is cute and vivacious and Crispin Glover is good.'Back To The Future' is one of the most enjoyable time-travelling classics. It's over 23 years old and it still hasn't gotten old. Sadly, they don't make it like this these days but then again we always can revisit them. That's why they're classics."
"3151","Back to the Future",9,"Let your imagination fly","A funny sci-fi? Unusual but here it not only works but does so spectacularly. A whimsical but very clever time travel story that bedazzles you leaving you wanting more.The charasmatic Michael J Fox plays a wonderful bumbling high schooler searching for love, a guitar gig and his existence which he himself threatens to erase.Clever and humourous references litter this fun flick; references which are further improved upon in the sequels. Views of the same scenes from different angles, different perspectives and different timelines abound.Fun for the entire family."
"3152","Back to the Future",10,"Great movie","One of the last movies I went with sister to see back in 86. The film blew my mind. My friends never wanted to see this one. I was happy I went. Many year's latter, I bought ""Back to the Future"" at Mc Donalds for $2.99 or for some other low price with a meal. The film ages well, and I love it just the same. The director and screen writer mixes science fiction, humor, and action perfectly. A big component of the script is time line theory which drives the story. Marty has many problems to fix, and finds out more than anyone wants to know about their parents. Michael J Fox and Christopher Loyd were excellently casted. Marty and Doc what a chemistry. With the film series one see the many dualities with time travel, that become a constant with the movie. The town clock, being awoke in a strange place, and letters. Keep this in mind when watching the 2 other sequels. The theory that time repeats itself is evident. What a time machine, the Delorian adds to this movie. Worth watch over again. 10 out of 10! Thank you TBS for showing all 3 films."
"3153","Back to the Future",10,"Absolute Classic","As a child, I used to watch this movie religiously. I loved the chemistry between Doc Brown and Marty McFly, I loved the all too familiar soundtrack and the ridiculous way in which George McFly laughs. This movie has become such a nostalgic and feel-good film for me. I had the good fortunate to see all three 'Back to the Future' movies in cinema last year and it was such an experience to watch this timeless classic with people who enjoy this film as much as I do. Everyone has to see this film at least once in their life! Such an amazing, funny Sci-Fi from the 1980's. I just can't get enough of this movie - it will just never get old. Cannot recommend it enough!"
"3154","Back to the Future",NA,"Gotta get back in time! Get back Marty!","BACK TO THE FUTURE (1985) **** Michael J. Fox, Christopher Lloyd, Lea Thompson, Crispin Glover, Thomas F. Wilson, Marc McClure, Wendy Jo Sperber. This generation's ""It's a Wonderful Life""?  Think about it.  Very popular and very entertaining sci-fi comedy that made Fox a movie star after success with tv's ""Family Ties"", casting him, after Eric Stoltz was dropped, as Marty McFly who winds up in a nuclear-powered DeLorean time-machine and is sent back in time to 1955 by his quintessentially eccentric friend Dr. Emmet Brown (Lloyd doing a fine Art Carney).  There he meets up with his parents to be and realizes his chance encounters have changed his future and he must see history repeat itself or perish.  High-concept hilarity and some truly ingenious schematics thanks to screenwriter Bob Gale and director Bob Zemeckis.  Wondering what it would be like to never be born and/or what it would be like if things were different...see what I mean.  Oscar-nominated song ""The Power of Love"" by Huey Lewis (who has a fun cameo) fuels this dynamo gem of a film.  Classic."
"3155","Back to the Future",NA,"Time Travel Movies Are Always Brilliant","Time travel movies never disappoint-that is because the concept of time travel is a very interesting one which most people must have thought about at one time or another. What would happen if you went back in time and an innocuous act changed the course of history for better or worse? It's something to think about.I won't reveal any plot details for this movie because it will spoil it for those who haven't seen it. Let's just say that Michael J. Fox as Marty McFly ends up back in 1955 where a sequence of events inadvertently orchestrated by Marty threaten his very existence. He is aided by Doc Brown played brilliantly by Christopher Lloyd who tries to get him back to 1985 without causing any damage to the fabric of time.The movie is great-and I feel it can be enjoyed by anyone regardless of their individual tastes in film genres. In fact, I find it hard to believe anyone could dislike a film like this. It has action, adventure, plenty of humour and some cool moments. All the actors involved in the movie play their parts great.Anyone who watches this movie will love it."
"3156","Back to the Future",10,"Best Part of a the Best Movie Ever","When you talk about Back to the Future, you have to talk about the whole trilogy. Because Zemeckis and Gale didn't make sequels they extended the length of one film, which is very different than a sequel.The ultimate film must allow the audience feel part of the film and relate to the characters. This film is the best because it takes a fantasy story and makes it adaptable to real-life. I don't know how soon anyone will be able to time-travel, but you can relate to Marty McFly's (Michael J. Fox) reaction to the change. Even if you're not a teenager you can believe it in someway. Back to the Future is the perfect and its been extended into a masterpiece with 2 sequels or extensions as I see it. Definitely a must see, if your pathetic enough not to have seen in at least the last 8 years.Amazing story by Gale and Zemeckis. Great acting especially by Michael J. Fox, but also great work by Christopher Lloyd, Lea Thompson and Tom Wilson. Such an exciting an involved story."

The movie has had such a strong impression on everyone, whether they have seen it or not, as it completely permeated pop culture.The script is genius, not only how it parallels 1955 and 1985 (some of the references are dynamite), but how it set the scene for the sequels (despite allegedly not intending to have any). This is just one clever gag after another, and may require repeated viewings to catch them all."

Humour,comedy, science fiction, this film has it all. This film will remain timeless,I would urge anyone who loves films to add this one to their list now. The special effects are still great looking and look far better then most effects today, your heart will still be in your mouth when Marty races towards the clock tower in a bid to get struck by lightning, this is a film you will watch again and again and will always put a smile on your face."

Ha ha! I'm back on track! Well, obviously, this is my first review for the first Back to the Future and when I came her to IMDb, I knew this was a well loved movie, I was just amazed at it being on the top 250, but I can't give it a lower rating because Back to the Future was an excellent film that was ground breaking for it's time and still today.Marty McFly and his good friend, The Doc, are two science nuts. Marty isn't really happy with his home life and the fact that he and his parents are very square and strict, The Doc calls Marty and shows him his latest invention, his De Lauren that he built into a time machine. When the government go after The Doc and Marty has to get away, he jumps in the car and goes back to the year of 1955, when his parents met. Instead of the way his mom and dad met happening to his dad, he ends up being in the position and mom ends up falling for her son, not even knowing! But he has to make sure his parents are together in time so he can get back without altering the future.Back to the Future to this day is still a timeless treasure that I notice more and more is becoming part of a newer generation. Michael J. Fox should be proud, his work will be remembered for a long time. Back to the Future worked so well because of the great story and the humor was great, the whole cast worked together and made a terrific movie that will be looked back on thirty years from now and still be considered cool.10/10"
"3161","Back to the Future",10,"The Lost Blockbuster","Back to the Future is one of those rare, almost forgotten, pieces of pop culture that, surprisingly, draws little attention to itself.  Unlike such notable gimmicks as Star Wars, Indiana Jones, Jaws, and Independence Day, there aren't any low-budget leeches trying to imitate off this work and cash-in on its success. This is due to the near flawless script.  Why it didn't win an Oscar, you're guess is as good as mine.  Making a time-travel storyline as in this movie that doesn't fall into plot holes the size of Terminator's is exceptionally difficult.  I'd know.The film starts slow, and gradually accelerates as it progresses.  You could almost call it a Jerry Bruckheimer movie for kids with Spielberg's trademark nostalgia.  The characters themselves are typical stereotypes for a movie like this and none of them, not even Marty himself, gel with potential.  In some ways it's as if MAD magazine made the film in an attempt to be serious.With such an automotive obsession as this film has, one must wonder if George Lucas was involved.Overall, I have to praise this movie for its inventiveness and originality, even if it created most of our time-travel cliches.  4 out of 5 stars.  Well worth your time."
"3162","Back to the Future",9,"Proof that Hollywood once was capable of putting magic on film","I watched this movie again for about the seventh time after a 10 year lapse or so. If there ever was magic on screen, Back to the Future has it. By the end of the film, I was only thinking, ""Wow, Hollywood was once capable of putting magic on the screen."" It really makes you wonder if the best of Hollywood is behind us.To summarize a few components of the movie: The storyline and plot are superb, even with the minor plot holes. The acting is spot on in every scene. Today's film editors should watch this film a hundred times to see what editing should really be like, nearly flawless. The direction is unbelievable in my opinion. The screen writing and script are perfect as well and will make you laugh and smile throughout the movie. Every line by the awkward McFly family, every crazy rumbling of ""Doc"", and even the cheesy bully taunts of Biff fit together so well.When I sat down to watch this movie a few days ago, I expected to see an aged movie that I remembered being much better than it actually was. I'm so glad I was wrong."

He turned it on one day and I brushed it off as ""one of those weird old movies daddy likes"". Eventually, I came out, sat down, and watched it. And the rest was history. I was so in love with this movie, that for 80's day at my school, I dressed up as Marty McFly. Nowadays, I love the movie more than ever. My favorite thing about this movie is the relationship between Doc and Marty. Most of the time, when a kid or teen hang out with an older person in movies and TV, people think they're more than friends. How many jokes have you heard involving Batman and Robin's relationship? However, Marty and Doc's relationship is pure friendship. I'm really good friends with one of my drama teachers, so I know how strong that type of friendship is. What else can I say?

There is a warmth and comfort to the way that Bob Gale and Bob Zemekis crafted this screenplay. It's pure genius. And for all of you fans that always have to mention ""plot holes"" or ""minor flaws"" - please make sure you have seen every second of the 25th Anniversary set of the trilogy that has an entire bonus disc, as well as more bonus features and two different commentaries on the main discs. Bob Gale is aware of every little detail about his script and talks about it in the commentaries. My true love of this film came as a result of watching all the behind the scenes material - which if you haven't seen, you must see it if you're a fan of this movie. It will give you a whole new level of appreciation for this film. As someone that is into filmmaking and a total nerd about directing, cameras, technical details, I can't get enough of watching and listening to these guys talk about how everything came together just right for this masterpiece to happen. I can't say enough about this film, its actors and all the people involved in making it. Truly something not to be rivaled and we will probably never see anything close to it ever again."
"3167","Back to the Future",10,"As close as you can get to a perfect movie","I feel that there is no such thing as a perfect film,but in today's cinema,""Back to the Future"" comes amazingly close.It has laughs, AND thrills,always a great combination.I am amazed at the attention paid to nearly every single detail here.For example,at the start of the film,Doc and Marty are in the parking lot of the ""Twin Pines Mall"".Then,shortly after Marty arrives in 1955,he accidently runs over one of old man Peabody's beloved pine trees.Toward the end, after Marty returns,the name of the mall changes.This is something you just don't notice until you see the film several times as I have. Excellent casting,particularly Christopher Lloyd as the unforgettable Doc Brown,the humor of the Ronald Reagan bit and the Johnny B. Goode sequence,along with the ultimate heart pounding ending and the attention to detail as I mentioned make this film as close to perfect as you will see in modern cinema.The sequels? Forget them.This is the only one of the trilogy you need to see."

"3169","Back to the Future",9,"Great!","There are though films, that you need to force yourself to pay attention to, before the payoff (the ultimate example being Tarkovsky's Andrei Rublev) and there are films that you can simply enjoy effortlessly, such as Back to the Future, one of the best films ever made! Yes, that's right, it surely belongs to the top 100 best films ever, perhaps top 30. I would rank it as among the top 5 comedies ever made and among the top 10 science fiction films ever made as well!Why? It is so freaking good! The 1980's were indeed the peak of pop culture: films and music only got better and better until they peaked in the mid 1980's and this is the peak right now: the coolest film ever made. It is way better than Raider of the Lost Ark in delivering fun!"
"3170","Back to the Future",10,"One Of The Greatest Films Ever Made. An Excellent And Unforgettable Classic.","Back To The Future is one greatest films ever made,an excellent and unforgettable classic that combines terrific direction,a wonderful cast,an amazing score and soundtrack,a fantastic script and great special effects. All of those elements make Back To The Future one of the best films of the 1980s that is Popcorn entertainment at it's best.Set in the fictional town of Hill Valley,California,Back To The Future tells the story of teenager Marty McFly(Michael J. Fox). who is asked by his friend eccentric scientist Dr. Emmett Brown(Christopher Lloyd)to help him on experiment a time machine made out of a Delorean car. After an unfortunate incident Marty gets into the time machine and is accidentally transported back to 1955 where he not only meets Dr. Brown but also meets his parents George(Crispin Glover)and Lorraine(Lea Thompson)as teenagers. With the help of Dr. Brown Marty must find a way to get back to the year 1985.Released in 1985,Back To The Future is a brilliant and entertaining film that was without a doubt the biggest Box Office hit of 1985 grossing over 300 million dollars world wide and is just an instant classic from the moment you watch it and is one of those movies that is the definition of what a blockbuster should be and where everything from the direction,the cast and story work to absolute perfection with no false note or missing beat. I don't think director Robert Zemeckis or the cast knew what they had was something that was special,magical and timeless and can be enjoyed by people of all ages and will continue to be enjoyed by past,present and future generations. The movie is also the first feature of one of the most beloved movie trilogies of all-time and while all three Back To The Future films are classics as a whole the first is still the best. What Back To The Future does so well is that it takes the time travel movie and gives it style and creativity mixing together different movie genres Comedy,SCI-FI,Action,Romance and thrills giving viewers everything but the kitchen sink but the movie never becomes uneven or confusing making Back To The Future one of the best genre mash-up movies I have ever seen. Although there are some serious moments Back To The Future is lighthearted with non-stop fun From beginning to end,Back To The Future has an energy and flow that just never stops and keeps you glued to the screen with relentless pace and excitement that makes the film re-watchable and iconic to this very day. The screenplay by Robert Zemeckis and Bob Gale is incredible and quotable with tons memorable scenes and dialog that are funny done with perfection and fun as well with ingenious style and rapid fire delivery that is wonderful. The Comedy and laughs in BTTF are hilarious and fun with moments that are over the top and great thanks to the actions and reactions of Marty and Doc Brown and the main characters. The SCI-FI scenes in BTTF involving the Delorean are so dazzling and are done with imagination and beauty that will make your jaw drop and it doesn't matter how many times you see BTTF you will be blown away by the Delorean sequences. There have been many classic movie duos throughout cinema and among the great duos are Marty and Doc. The scenes between Marty and Doc are truly funny with terrific back and forth banter and have some of the best scenes in the film that are unforgettable. While the two are different in personality and are separated by age the two have a friendship that feels genuine and real where you feel that Marty and Doc would have each other's back at all costs. The friendship between Marty and Doc is further cemented in Part II and III where you feel they will be friends forever whether it's in the future or in the present. Marty and Doc are two amazing and memorable characters that will never be forgotten. The ending of Back To The Future is terrific,thrilling and filled with surprises that will leave viewers laughing and smiling. A fantastic ending.The cast is wonderful. Michael J. Fox is excellent and funny as Marty McFly,with Fox bringing laughs and charisma to the role. Christopher Lloyd is brilliant as Dr. Emmett Doc Brown,with Lloyd being delightfully over the top and having a fantastic chemistry with Fox. Lea Thompson and Crispin Glover are wonderful as Lorraine and George McFly,Marty's parents. Thomas F. Wilson is terrific and fun as Biff,a neighborhood bully. James Toklin is great as Mr. Strickland,a hard nosed principal. Claudia Wells(Jennifer),Mark McClure(Dave McFly),Wendie Jo Sperber(Linda McFly),Jeffrey Jay Cohan(Skinhead),Casey Siemaszko(3-D),Billy Zane(Match),George DiCenzo(Sam Baines),Francis Lee McCain(Stella Baines),Harry Waters Jr.(Marvin Berry),Donald Fullilove(Goldie Wilson),Will Hare(Pa Peabody)and Norman Alden(Lou)give good performances as well.The direction by Robert Zemeckis is amazing,with Zemeckis always moving the camera while giving the film with great camera angles,pace and atmosphere.The score by Alan Silvestri is outstanding and one of best scores in movie history,with Silvestri's score being epic,suspenseful and uplifting. Incredible score,Silvestri. There is also a great soundtrack featuring songs by Huey Lewis And The News(The Power Of Love and Back In Time).The Special Effects by Industrial,Light and Magic is dazzling and visual stunning and will blow your mind. Great effects,ILM.In final word,if you love Comedies,SCI-FI,Robert Zemeckis or Films in general,I highly suggest you see Back To The Future,one of the greatest films ever made and an excellent,unforgettable classic that you will watch again and again. Highly Recommended. 10/10."
"3171","Back to the Future",9,"best sci-fi comedy","You can't review each movie alone, the trilogy is so bond together that it's impossible.Must say that this is one of the most memorable Sci-fi comedies or movies related to time- travel in the whole film making history. The story's great, you'll love the plot. Dr. Brown's explanations make sure that even the most complex things could be understood by everyone. You'll get excited for all the high-tense scenes like never, even after seeing it several times. That's one of the best things about the movie. Alan Silvestri's score is just great, gives an emotional touch like not many scores do.Now, a little problem comes to the fx. instead of using models like in star wars (what also made star wars win Oscars for the effects) they started using CG, just CG technology wasn't yet so perfectioned in 80s-90s like nowadays. That's a little problem though, the movie's not overloaded with these FX at all."
"3172","1917",10,"Review from a combat veteran.","Last night COL Ferry and I (COL Coldwell, both USA) were able to watch the new WWI film, 1917, before it has national release. It is a cinematographic feast for the eyes, long expansive shots that follow the protagonists as they execute their mission. It does not hide the horrors that existed in trench warfare, it shows them for their brutality and abundance. (My great uncle died as a consequence of his service fighting in the trenches, mustard gas poisoning). In many ways it reminded me of Saving Private Ryan.For those who have served in combat (I have deployments to Iraq and Afghanistan), I cannot tell you if the film will be too difficult to watch, it might well be, especially if incoming artillery is a trigger. For me, as the camera travels a few inches above the dirt advancing slowly up a berm, my response was visceral. I was taken back to the patrols we walked in Afghanistan, not knowing what was around the corner; not relaxing heightened vigilance, not knowing if there would be an IED, a child wearing a suicide vest, a sniper taking aim. For the protagonists in this film (as for all who served and are serving) surviving the climb up the berm, there is no sigh of relief, no respite from the fear of uncertainty. They (we) survive to move forward to face more uncertainty.Watching allowed me to pay homage to my great uncle, and the approximate 800,000 other Brits who were killed or died as a consequence of their service. (Germany lost over 2 million soldiers in the war). Estimates put the total casualty numbers for both military and civilians at 40 million, half killed or died from wounds/infection.I rate this film as 10/10, for many reasons. Directing, acting, set design, cinematography, musical score, the raw emotion it invokes. Some critics have said they never felt a connection with the characters, I suspect they never served in combat. While the brotherhood (including female War Fighters) is strong, there is also a common characteristic possessed by all War Fighters, the ability to focus on a mission and suppress emotion, even as those around the Fighter fall. This was the quality I recognized in the actors and why the viewer doesn't ""bond"" with the main protagonists; we, the viewer, were on the mission with them, we grieve as we can and move on.Watch if you will, but know there is no pleasure in watching and the film will grab you and the beginning and not let you go. Even though we know the outcome of WWI, there is no joy, there is no peace. Watch because it will allow you a glimpse at the horror and brutality of war; reflect on their service and sacrifice. Note, as we (the viewer) are ""walking"" through the trenches, glancing shots of the young soldiers shows them with flat affect, isolation, almost apathy; this is the face of ""shell shock,"" what we know call post-traumatic stress disorder.For original WW1 footage, watch ""They Shall Never Grow Old,"" an exceptional documentary."
"3173","1917",10,"I Wanted to Hate This Hauntingly Beautiful Gift of a Movie","I sat in a packed yet silent theater this morning and watched, what I believe to be, the next Academy Award winner for the Best Picture. I'm not at all a fan of war movies but I am a fan of great movies....and 1917 is a great movie.
I have never been so mesmerized by set design and direction, the mass human emotion of this film is astonishingly captured and embedded magically in the audience. It keeps running through my mind...the poetry and beauty intertwined with the raw misery of war.
Treat yourself....see this movie!"
"3174","1917",10,"Words fail me","This film is overwhelming. I have nothing further to add, other than the compelling need for eternal remembrance to those who sacrificed their lives in any way, we can not fathom. We, citizens of any country, today, should feel ourselves lucky and blessed to exist. A Happy New Year to all. George from Hellas. NB: do not give it a second thought; watch it; even if this genre is not your cup of tea. After all, it is much more than a feature film. It's a massive dedication to unselfishness. Do yourself a favour and watch it. And then watch it once more."
"3175","1917",10,"Don't listen to critics!","Don't listen to the critics saying this movie is boring. This movie is one of the most tense and exciting movies I've seen in years. Amazing cinematography and overall amazing experience of a movie."
"3176","1917",10,"We're living in such wonderful times...","1917 is a poem.
Is the most deep, impressive and realistic way of seeing what kinds of things happened in WWI.
This movie made me leave the movies with tears in my eyes as if I have had a time travel experience to the World War I, and then waking up and realizing how wonderful are the times we are living in.
1917 is a must see movie for everyone."
"3177","1917",10,"Here goes the Oscar for best cinematography","Guaranteed Oscar. A technical and visual triumph. Bravo Roger Deakins!"
"3178","1917",9,"An achievement","It's a stunning watch from start to finish. The amount of work that went into this film alone deserves your attendance, and even then, the story never stalls, and has a fair balance between war and humanity, and has some of the most incredible camera work I've seen in a while. It's hands down my favorite film of 2019."
"3179","1917",10,"One of the greatest war movies of all time","This is hands down one of the greatest war movies to ever hit the silver screen along with being very unique. The hell of the WWI battlefield is a subject that hasn't been covered in a long time and Mr. Mendes executes this perfectly. A movie like this couldn't have been made 50 years ago but with today's advances in film making along with a large studio budget Mr. Mendes takes us through an adventure every bit as harrowing as Saving Private Ryan and Thin Red Line.The use of the single shot was brilliant as it brings the viewer along in the trenches and further adds to the realism to the film. I was surprised to hear that this was gimmicky effect from some critics, I feel Mr. Mendes nailed it brilliantly with the help of some fantastic cinematography. The set pieces were so realistic and detailed, a lesser director would've focused more on them but for this ride the camera never stops moving and it's a benefit to the film.There was no slow part in the movie and the audience is enthralled with the journey from the first minute of the film. The dialogue was great and certainly was a key component of making the single shot method work here. There is no pointless exposition in the movie.This isn't a piece to glorify war but rather demonstrate how one can be brave all the while showing their vulnerabilities and fear that any normal person would feel in that type of situation. There are no gratuitous bits in the film to exemplify heroism, just a simple story that allows the characters to shine and define bravery on their own terms.From the acting, to the score, to the cinematography, editing and overall direction of the film Mr. Mendes absolutely knocked it out of the park. This isn't just one of the best war movies of all time, I believe it's truly one of the best pieces of film to ever grace the big screen. 1917 will leave you breathless and for many like myself, in tears when the journey comes to and end.Bravo!!"
"3180","1917",10,"1917","Absolutely incredible - I've seen it 3 times in cinemas and each time I find myself even more in awe of, blown away by, and in love with this film. It's thrilling, tense, gentle, satisfying, and deeply beautiful. As a huge fan of the war genre, this is unlike any other film I've ever seen - it finds its true strength in its unexciting, human moments rather than in the mindless chaos of firefights, while still managing to have some of the most exhilarating and edge-of-your-seat segments I've ever seen. Schofield is a brilliant and unconventional choice for the lead character, and his empathy and softness have made him one of my favourite characters of all time and an exceptionally rare example of how quiet tenderness truly can carry a war film better than loud banter and hyper-masculine bluster so often does. Krysty Wilson-Cairns is a genius and George Mackay said so much more in Schofield's silence than most actors could hope to in the grandest monologue. A masterpiece."
"3181","1917",6,"10/10 for Technique and Cinematography... 4/10 for Story and Characterization...","It's an experience, certainly, and I do recommend seeing it in a good cinema.Deakins was fantastic, absolutely, some stunning cinematography.But I found the movie incredibly disappointing overall. Feels like a missed opportunity, a very interesting experiment that just does not quite work.Most of the movie felt like a series of Call Of Duty cut scenes, a video game you had no control over, a really odd feeling, and some of the scenes were like a video game in content with reality stretched to almost breaking point.To me it was an adventure movie rather than a 'war movie', much more like Indiana Jones than Saving Private Ryan... To relate it to another movie I felt it reminded me very much of The Revenant in story and style, but like that movie it felt rather empty to me."
"3182","1917",8,"A technical masterpiece","Sam Mendes' war drama is set during World War I and very personal to him, as it tells a story his grandfather used to tell him when he was still a young lad. Dedicated to Mendes' hero, this drama cuts deep when we join two young soldiers on a mission to deliver a message that could possibly save thousands of fellow combatants.Filmed and edited as if it was one long take, the camera never leaves our main protagonists, Blake (Dean-Charles Chapman) and Schofield (George MacKay), out of its sight. Mendes (Skyfall) and co-writer Krysty Wilson-Cairns (Penny Dreadful) therefore corner themselves by relying on this kind of linear storytelling, to tell a very focused but at times a somewhat thin tale. Some of the scenes are so empty, it will for sure test audiences' patience. Technical, '1917' is a true feast for the eyes and ears.Roger Deakins' (Blade Runner 2049) cinematography is once again breathtakingly superior to anything else you've seen this year, and for sure will be the one thing people unanimously praise. Sound editing/mixing, visual effects and production design are all outstanding. These are the things, people will remember. It is Thomas Newman's (Passengers) score that elevates every moment happening in front of you, intensifying the emotions brought by our main characters. And although MacKay (Captain Fantastic) and Chapman (Game of Thrones) do a pretty phenomenal job at capturing the true essence of their characters going through a literal hell, it's the side characters with little-to-no screen time who steal their spotlight. Andrew Scott (Fleabag), Mark Strong (Shazam!), Richard Madden (Rocketman) and Benedict Cumberbatch (Dr. Strange) are checkpoints along the way, but man, do they impress with the few lines they're given.1917 is without a doubt a technical masterpiece, that will inspire many filmmakers, but I can't feel a bit let down. As an overall film, it wants to play a heavy tune on your heartstrings, but can't reach that level of sentiment, because the focus on technicalities pulled me out of the story. It for sure is one of the better films 2019 has brought to the big screen, yet a bit more focus on the script could've made this the cinematic masterpiece of the decade. Nonetheless, I recommend watching this on the biggest screen possible and enjoy another fine piece of cinema brought to you by Sam Mendes."
"3183","1917",8,"A technical marvel, 1917's one-shot conceit is immersive and affecting","1917 is a very good film in general, but it's the way it's shot that marks it as an artistically cutting-edge film. It brings the technical excellence of Dunkirk, with great war sets and brutally realistic depictions of the intensity of war, but intelligently turns to a humanist angle in telling a simple story of two men trying to help their country's men. There are no bad elements of 1917, but it's the phenomenal execution of the one-shot technique that makes it great. The tracking shots in the trenches made me realize how much less immersive it is to be constantly cut to the front of the next shot, rather than seeing the path the characters take. Given that it's this one epic journey, it is fitting to go on it with Schofield the whole way. The colors and big war shots (especially Schofield running across the war zone to reach the captain and him jumping into the river) were gorgeous. The score is essential, ratcheting tension up quickly in scenes like the rat trip wire and also calming it down in personal scenes like one character's death and when Schofield meets the baby and woman. War is so extreme and all-encompassing that it's truly difficult for any film to accurately capture it, but 1917 belongs up there with the best efforts. It is a film of brutality and loyalty, but above all it's a beautiful work of art about one of the ugliest subjects known to man."
"3184","1917",10,"My favorite movie of 2019","I saw a preview screening about two hours ago and I am still in shock. This is the best war movie I have seen in a decade. The shots Mendes uses and what he demands of his actors is nothing short of incredible. If you get a chance this will probably be the last must see movie of 2019. I will be seeing this again on release."
"3185","1917",8,"Riveting, hauntingly beautiful and mesmerizing","The entire movie made to look like it's shot at one single take, this is possible because of extraordinary talented 14 times Academy Award nominee cinematographer Roger Deakins. This man is a genius, the movie is shot beautifully. it is mesmerizing to a watch world war 1 movie like it is happening right in front of you. The pacing is phenomenal. The only real flaw in the movie is that there are no great character building movements like other war movies but that is also intentional because, the main intention or motive is to save lives and not focus on characters in the movie and that works."
"3186","1917",7,"1917","Great cinematography. Best part for me was the first 15 minutes. The film loses a bit of steam in the final act but the journey to get there is enjoyable and technically brilliant."
"3187","1917",6,"I dont get the raves","Sure, it had a few good cinematic shots.But the story felt hollow - cardboard cutout characters - generic message delivery through enemy lands. Almost feel like they did it by the numbers."
"3188","1917",8,"1917 recruits you to experience a war journey done in an impressive ""one-shot"" style that I can't say i've seen before","Saving Private Ryan, 30 Seconds over Tokyo, Patton, Inglorious Bastards, The Great Escape and Schindler's List are only a few of the countless movies about World War II that have been made. In fact, many are still made today. So why haven't there been a lot of movies about the first World War? I think it comes down to exactly what was being fought for and what it meant for everyone. Everyone can agree that Nazism is bad and running a nation as a dictatorship robs everyone of their freedom. Germany was a common enemy that everyone would want to fight, similar to a simple film's goal of good against evil.While World War I may have not had a simple enemy to get behind, it's still an important war as it collapsed several European empires, set the stage for a revolution in Russia, put the U.S. in a larger military position and unfortunately led to the deaths of millions. What movies can do is really put us in the position of those solders to see the magnitude of warfare and it's path of devastation. This may make 1917 one of the most intense movies to sit through, but an important one to witness.In the misty month of April in 1917, English soldiers are resting after seeing the Germans pulling back from the western front. Two solders, Blake (played by Dean-Charles Chapman) and Schofield (played by George MacKay) are assigned to deliver a message to another Battalion. They receive more information from General Erinmore (played by Colin Firth), where they find out that the 2nd Battalion , which is assuming an easy victory, is about to walk into a deadly battle with most of the German offensive attacking there. With the phone lines cut, both Blake and Schofield are instructed to cross No Man's Land to find the Battalion and deliver a message to not attack.Plot wise, that's all you need to know about 1917. The rest of the movie follows these two men as they cross over the horror that is No Man's Land, abandoned German trenches and everything else that would scare any soldier crossing the lines. What separates this from a lot of other war movies is that the entire film is created to appear that everything is done in one continuous shot, never taking the perspective away from the main characters. This also includes time and light, depending whether it's day or night.Even with it's ambition, 1917 is still a phenomenal movie that's an experience that gave my heart a large rush. Director Sam Mendes (American Beauty, Skyfall) clearly wanted to give audiences the best way to experience the trenches and gunshots and did so through this one shot story. Birdman may have done something similar, but given how many extras and special effects went off, I would love to see a behind the scenes look at how everything was done. The cinematography pays a lot of detail to little things like the color of the sky during sunrise and how much paler skin would become after death.The story feels a lot like something out of theme park or a video game...and I mean that in a good way. You're aware that your watching someone else's experience , but the right angles do make you feel like you're a part of it. Where 1917 endures in the story is it's simple goal while going through several layers of warfare Hell. I could see this getting boring quick, but despite it's one shot goal, every scene still has a different look that never feels too familiar. The movie knows not to stop for too long unless it was for an important reason. It's a rush.Does this movie into the bigger political or social impact of World War I? No, but that was never the intention. It's like watching someone's small story that is large in scale. If I did have any problems is that there's a point where a character is knocked out and he's awoken. I won't say where, but it broke part of the spell that the movie put me in. You can tell it's a point where they were hiding an edit, but if the movie had a bunch of them in plain sight, you'd think they could have done better.I'll give this eight dogfight planes out of ten. Like a lot of war movies, this isn't a pleasant experience. It isn't supposed to be; it's meant to be a tool to really give you something that a lot of people have forgotten about as WWI movies aren't made a lot. I highly recommend this if your willing to see something that I can't say I could make myself."
"3189","1917",9,"Technical and visual peak of cinema","1917 is a brilliant adventure film, which was released in the 1. World War. Apart from an emotionally charged story, realistic dialogues and well acted characters, the movie offers a masterpiece of craftsmanship. Roger Deakins behind the camera manages to create a gripping experience through unique images and consistent camera work close to the main characters. Moreover, the sets seem to be taken from real life and make the viewer feel as if they are at war themselves."
"3190","1917",10,"This is real cinema!","Every warfilm that gets released people instantly jump on the ""cliche"" band wagon. War is war and always will be so ofcourse there will be similarities so just get over it..
I'm a huge warfilm buff and being in the military I see more things in war movies that annoy me than an regular person but I dont let them reuin the entertainment side.
If you dont want a cliche dont watch a war film simple.
Back to the topic, 1917 is epic.
Totally gripping through the entire movie it blew my mind. It truly was a techincal mastepeice and deserves every acolade it gets.
Cannot wait fir 4k with an atmos mix!"
"3191","1917",9,"Poignant, intimate, oppressive and bombastic! Mendes' uncut war!","In addition to two ""James Bond"" films, Sam Mendes has made many moving and strong works, such as ""American Beauty"", ""Road to Perdition"" and ""Jarhead"". This time Mendes returns spectacularly and poignantly to the war theme with ""1917"". The undercover favorite at the next Oscars (he has been nominated for ten trophies). Well, the Oscars have long ceased to be as important as they used to be, but of course I'm happy when a film like this is honored. For me, ""1917"" is already one of the best films in 2020!1917: The British soldier Lance Corporal Blake, together with his friend Lance Corporal Schofield, is ordered to cancel an attack on the Germans. To do this, they have to travel a long way to get to the western front. It's about saving hundreds of soldiers from a massacre. The order is all the more important for Blake because his older brother is among the units ...The film got into conversation quickly because ""1917"" is arranged so that everything looks like one shot. Of course there are some hidden cuts here (as with ""Birdman"" from 2015), but visually ""1917"" stands out right from the start. A beautiful and breathtaking looking film and the reason is quickly determined: Roger Deakins. He is the best camera operator for me in his field. One of his most recent projects, ""Blade Runner 2049"", is one of the most powerful and beautiful films of all time for me.
In Mendes' film again he creates unique images and scenes. Like how a city lights up in dark flames and tranforms into a real hell. Then it gets really intimate again when the camera follows the two soldiers into a mine. One spectacular setting chases the next. For this reason alone, you should see this film. Thomas Newman underlines the visually stunning epic with a moving score. Perhaps a little too sentimental for some, but I found Newman's score to be very moving (which funnily fits the visual style of the movie), no matter whether it were the emotional or the dark, atmospheric moments.Fortunately, the film can also convince in another area: the story. For some it may just be a film in which two soldiers have to achieve a goal, but for me it is exactly this simple story that leaves a lot of space for visual storytelling. There are also longer dialogue scenes, but ""1917"" often also works as a very calm war film, which is more about the physical challenges. But a figure can also grow on it, which in my opinion is shown stunningly.The cast is wonderful: George McKay and Dean-Charles Chapman are both great as protagonists. In addition, big names shine, such as Colin Firth or Benedict Cumberbatch. I appreciate the fact that many of the characters, both meet along the way can only be seen once (which also applies to the locations!). Mendes creates the feeling of having to go a long way with the two main characters, where you don't look back, you just move forward.Conclusion: ""1917"" will surely remind many of Christopher Nolan's ""Dunkirk"". Both films have a similar structure and similar themes, but each film is something different. I was a little afraid that ""1917"" would try to be the new ""Dunkirk"", but Sam Mendes made the film something special (like Nolan did with his movie). A moving war drama that is completely convincing both visually and with its history!"
"3192","1917",6,"Dissenting view: technical achievement, mediocre movie","I have a special fondness for movies that set technical limitations and still achieve full bodied, engrossing story telling. For example, Stephen Knight's Locke is one man, in a car, by himself - and it's riveting. Die Hard takes place (mostly) in a single blinding. 1917 sets a limitation for itself by presenting the movie as a single continuous shot. (It's really at least three, but that's beside the point.)The rationale is that this would immerse the viewer in the experience of the war. And despite Deakins skill in pulling off the achievement, I think it does the opposite. It's awkward at times, distracting, and gives up the foundational language of film: the power of editing. Some thoughts:Cutting focuses our attention, shifts our point of view, can put us both inside and outside the experience of the characters.The long shots of the characters walking toward the camera in the trenches are off putting. They are completely unlike the way we experience reality - how often do we hold a steady gaze on a single point while walking in real life? It's meant to be subjective and immersive, but it's the opposite.Things get better outside of the trench when the camera has more movement, but get worse in the ruined village, a sequence that looks more like a video game with new pursuers appearing in the channel behind him.The monotony of the single tales had me looking around the frame for the bodies in the mud, pressed in the trench walls, etc. - impressive art direction, but distracting, pulling me out of the story.The bodies sticking out of the mud were supposed to be horrifying, but they struck me as antiseptic. And one reminded me of Davy Jones ship in the second Pirates movie, which made me laugh inappropriately.The real problem is that we have scene this movie before. The plot is the same as Saving Private Ryan, or even Thin Red Line or the Naked and the Dead, which were also built around a single mission. I think Mendes tried to overcome a familiar story with the single take idea. I also think that he can't resist sentimentalizing the story and reaching for unearned emotion.The flaws of the movie are seen in the far to brief appearance of Mark Strong, who is strong, grounded, real, everything the rest of the movie is not. A more cinematic approach, and a story more grounded in human experience, and built out of characterizations like Strong's, would have been much more interesting.As it is, 1917 is a mildly interesting experiment with a conventional story at its center."
"3193","1917",9,"A century and three years old, 1917 relives the terrifying but excellent journey of two unsung heroes.","It features a realistic portrayal of a true remarkable story following the appalling journey of two soldiers having to call off the attack against Germany.1917 is a massive technical achievement done right. The camera tracks this pair of individuals with a smooth good-looking one continuous shot for 110 mins! Despite it's not exactly one shot, the slick technique where it manages to trick the audience's eyes when a one shot jumps from the other is brilliant.Cinematography is riveting to the eyes. There are so many important close-ups that picture a thousand words of these two soldiers about their past and their emotional trauma of the World War 1 effect. The better thing is it knows when to pull back from those close-ups to reveal the true scale of the horrendous and the shock of the battlefield.Immersively done, 1917 sucks you into the sheer horror of experiencing the daunting moments of World War 1. You will feel as if you are walking with these men.1917 is a highly suspenseful film from the front 'till the end of the line. I can assure you, the intensity is greater than 90% horror movies in the last decade. Sam Mendes escalates the tense atmosphere little by little before he uncovers everything in the final 20 minutes.The set feels very much like a breath of air back in the early 1900s. It is unrelenting seeing objects, locations and soldiers are bombed into pieces, excellently enhanced by how specific the layouts are to justify the maddening era of bloodbath.Though feels gimmicky, the music projects a powerful influence in increasing the gritty war moments and giving the sense that every scene should be appreciated as much as possible.George Mackay & Dean Chapman's performances are great however, I wish they could give more. The former expresses his raw emotions clearly but sometimes, he falls flat and the latter's way of characters feels quite unbelievable due to Chapman's failure to construct expressions that is substantially connected to the impacts of war. For mega-awards like Golden Globe & Oscar, the lack of creativity to create nuances details on their face, resulted in them not nominated for Best Actor/Supporting Actor.1917 renders much of a survival movie like Dunkirk rather than non-stopping war shootings genre. The plot is where the downside comes. Mind that it is great and propulsively executed but the emptiness of the sub-stories is what 1917 suffers.1917 also hurts by putting in dialogues that does not drive the story further, but only to give a sense of what personality the characters embody.Verdict: 1917 is a warfare that feels immersive and nerve-wracking with its glorious cinematography and visual designs however, it occasionally steps into the landmines which is forgivable as the whole movie transmits an experience that is substantially novelty and worth living for."
"3194","1917",10,"A Technical Masterpiece","1917 is in a class of its own when it comes to cinematography. The one-take illusion ensures that you can't look away. The story is beautifully written with a great plot and characters. Even the supporting characters are extremely well written. Sam Mendes and Roger Deakins create a visually stunning war atmosphere with some incredible set designs. Chapman and MacKay's performances succeed in making you care for their characters. 1917 is without a doubt one of the greatest movies of the decade!"
"3195","1917",10,"No movie has ever made me feel like this before.","This film made me create an account on this site and leave my first ever review on anything. I was not expecting this. I was hooked from the start and felt like I was in the movie experiencing the journey myself. I have never been so attached from reality while watching a movie. Or should i even use that phrase because what this movie showed was actual reality once. Let's say this movie attached me from the reality of our modern time of peace and just for few hours brought my mind to the reality of war over 100 years ago. This is a movie for all humans with human emotions.
I got watery eyed multiple times during the movie. I have got watery eyed during some emotional movies before and I thought that was the level of emotion this movie could bring me and keep at. Not the case. I was shown a whole new level of emotional movie experiences. This movie experience was going to be like nothing else before. It felt like I was building tension inside my body from holding back emotions during the movie. After the movie finished I was in shock. I could only stare at the credits without moving a limb except clenching my fists to hold back tears because I didn't want to start crying in the movie theater. I could feel my heart rate go up and breathing getting shallower and faster. I was even shaking a bit. This was a real moment for me. There was only one couple of people left in their seats clearly emotional too when we finally slowly left the theater after I got back my ability to move. I couldn't say much to my fiancé while we were walking home. She was concerned because I was so quiet and asked me how I was feeling and I only could tell her that I just wanted to go home so I could cry. We got home, I let all the built up emotions out and cried my eyes out to my fiancés scarf while hugging her making her cry too. It felt like my soul was washed when I let the emotions loose with the tears flowing out. It was a relief. I felt pure. This was very unique and personal experience. It's amazing how art can have such an effect on human emotions. I had never been made feel likes this before by a piece of art. Now I have. I am grateful."
"3196","1917",9,"Outstanding!","I won't say anything about how immersive and impressive on a technical level this gritty yet moving film is; I just want to say that I can't remember the last time I identified with and was emotionally invested in a character in a war film as I did with George MacKay's William Schofield. What a talent!(9/10)"
"3197","Relic",6,"Disturbing, unsettling but also a little dull...","I've been awaiting the arrival of this film ever since watching the trailer a few weeks ago. It had that depth of darkness and a feeling of realness to it that I look for in a good horror film. Relic explores the subject of dementia in a unique fashion that will pull at your heart strings. Especially for those that have dealt with the illness first hand.Relic is essentially a drama which disguises itself as a horror film by using a few of the classic horror conventions and clichés. The metaphors provide the real horror here.The three main actors do a great job of conveying the story and deliver a wonderful performance that will leave you emotionally gripped throughout. Where Relic lacks, is in pace. At times it can be rather dull, long winded and only finally picks up in the last 1/3rd of the film.The climax of the film will have you on the edge of your seat and is easily the best part of the film. Those that don't like thought provoking, symbolic conclusions will probably want to stay clear of this one. Still, it's one of the more memorable endings to a film I've seen in a while and undoubtedly uncomfortable.This one is worth the runtime just for the brilliant score, ambiance and composition. You definitely need a decent pair of headphones or a nice sound system to get the most out of this one. The film is very dark, visually, it can be hard to make out specific details in most scenes. Obviously this is done to expand the creepy and unpredictable atmosphere but if anything, makes the film seem duller.It's not a 10/10 movie by any means but it does serve as a mildly entertaining way to pass an hour and a half of time. Especially if you don't have anything else to do or watch. Give it a go, you may like it.My retrospective on this one: sometimes you have to discard the old version of a person you knew and learn to love them for what they've become."
"3198","Relic",8,"Dummy reviews","Another one of these films where most reviews here say a lot more about the reviewer than the film.This is quite an intelligent debut. Not a masterpiece, but obviously not ""the worst movie ever"" or ""incredibly boring""It's just a bit more original than the average Blumhouse blueprinted copycat."
"3199","Relic",7,"Oh my. What a lovely work.","It's so rare that anyone uses the horror genre to tell you something you needed to know about life. I'm absolutely overwhelmed at how elegantly this film horrified me, how totally it drew me in, and the *work* being done by the cast.A really beautiful, touching, absolutely terrifying movie, that hit me across nearly every note. My gosh. Worth a watch."
"3200","Relic",8,"Very unique horror, I had to shut it off.","This is well done and I can't say I have seen anything like it. The actors are very good and the script is creative and well timed. It's a fairly slow burn but not enough to lose your attention. I love a good horror but this one hit too close to home. I couldn't handle it. That's never happened before.
When I was a teenager, my best friend and I, used to get rocked and go see movies like The Exorcist. So, when I say I couldn't handle THIS movie, that says something.
If you love a good horror and you are the target audience, this one will give you nightmares. If you're not the target audience, it probably won't phase you. For instance, if you are afraid of flying, then movies about aircraft accidents will effect you. If you are not afraid of flying you can mentally step back and not get nervous watching a movie about airplane accidents. It's like that. If something like this has even remotely touched your life, this movie will rattle your cage big time."
"3201","Relic",2,"Filming something in the dark doesn't make it scary.","Honestly couldn't see half of what was going on. Greatly overrated, which is sad because I love a good Australian movie."
"3202","Relic",6,"Empathize the feelings of family members with dementia","The movie is good in the sense that it makes you feel how does it to have a family member who has dementia illness, alzheimer.The movie depicts the feelings of being lost, and helplessness in the face of an illness that can turn a person into something else, to a different person. And it also teaches you to deal with it, you need to embrace it.Good visual scenes, and sound effects. Normally, I don't like movies like this but I liked this one."
"3203","Relic",4,"Another attempt that ends in nothing","Here we go again....Another attempt of a slow burn horror but the only thing that burnt out was my patience. I mean it's one thing if after all the build up made suspense we would actually get some genuine scares but here it is just not there. Nothing, Nada, not a single moment of fear.At the end of the day the movie can look good, have fine actors and possess a decent story but it would be nothing without the actually horror which turns out to be the title of the genre.Avoid."
"3204","Relic",10,"IGNORE THE REVIEWS.","A young director clearly inspired by the great Aronofsky writes and directs a masterpiece about death and loss using craftily symbolisms.The movie is not for everybody to comprehend and clearly has an average of 6/10 cause most people expecting to see a cliche haunted house story."
"3205","Relic",10,"Flawless debut for Natalie Erika James","Any negative reviews come from people who do not have a real appreciation for cinema. This movie was unique and thought-provoking. I wanted to start it again as soon as it ended. If you liked The Babadook, this is for you."
"3206","Relic",2,"Should've just been a short indie horror game","To start off, I've read a lot of good reviews about this movie, so I was hopeful that it would be a promising first movie by a new director, but it's just......eh. Twenty minutes in and I wanted to watch the movie sped up, it felt slow and nothing was really happening, I think that it was trying to go for a slow build-up but it just didn't work for me. I didn't care about the characters, I knew little to nothing about the ""ghost"" or whatever the whole black ash stuff was, and there was really nothing new or unique about this movie, sorry that this seems harsh but I felt like I watched a live-action version of a run-of-the-mill indie horror game. The dream sequences felt like they meant nothing and they were just repeats of the same thing, a cabin in the woods, a glass window, and the grandmother. I'm just disappointed and confused about how this movie I wasted money on got so much praise.It would've been fine as a short, indie, horror game, whispering voices, a few jump scares, and a few ""TURN BACK"" notes, and then an ending with a jumpscare. I get that it's supposed to also be a metaphor for Alzheimer's but I didn't really get to know the grandmothers past enough to feel bad for her memory loss, no flashbacks, pictures, or videos. I completely think that this movie would've been better off being a drama about a woman and her daughter dealing with the grandmother's Alzheimers instead of this weird supernatural mess. A good example of a movie that was able to perfectly do family drama and horror is ""Hereditary"", there were enough arguments and somber moments to keep your attention as a family drama and there were enough creepy moments to keep you interested in how the horror was going to play out. However, hereditary is a movie that took a lot of detail, money, and had a lot more behind it than this movie probably had, no offense of course.But the director didn't use what they had to their best ability. On a positive note, I did think that there was one good emotional moment that displayed Alzheimer's, and I kind of liked the last scene in the movie even if I didn't understand what the hell it meant. But in the end, skip this one, keep your money, or watch a better movie instead."
"3207","Relic",4,"Another smug and pretentious slow burn ""horror"" (drama) that claims the metaphor is the monster. Surprised this isn't an A24 film because it's that dull and dry.","Why do these awful artsy fartsy contrived dramas keep being passed as horror when they're absolutely not. Are critics just that clueless and deluded? This plays by the numbers like so many other critically hailed ""horror"" films of the last decade. Apparently to get great reviews you can just follow the same dry uninspired formula of symmetrical camerawork and supposed dread inducing overacting. Then add a deep metaphorical message that is just as effective as an actual visual monster because "" what you can't see is scarier"". No that isn't true horror. It's drama. It's just such a miserably lazy film even though Mortimer salvages it from being truly terrible."
"3208","Relic",1,"Disappointed","Disappointed in the plot despite a great cast. No real riveting storyline and a waste of time. Generally love a good Australian thriller but this did not live up to expectations"
"3209","Relic",8,"The best film to escape the media drought thus far","Not everyone is frightened by ghosts, not everyone is frightened by brain-gobbling hordes of zombies, and the recent wannabe-edgy hype around serial killers has made for damn sure that not everyone's scared of those either. For more universal and inescapably ""real"" fears, we have horror films as stirring and remorseless as Relic.Slowly but surely losing a loved one, especially during their proverbial ""sunset years"", is something we all must face - a claim I cannot make as confidently about ghost attacks and scary monsters. It is difficult to imagine anyone being spared of this experience; the grief, the rage, and yes, the insurmountable fear (accompanying the realization that we all share the same final destination, no matter what manner of sequel we've been promised by -INSERT BELIEF SYSTEM HERE-).If you, like everyone else on the planet right now, are peckish for something new to enjoy in this unprecedented summer-movie drought, here comes a unique Australian horror movie to hopefully hold you over. Then again, I cannot guarantee you'll ""enjoy"" it per se, as it's a harsh one to process.This film is remarkably well-made and nifty in its communication as it is, but since it also constitutes Natalie Erika James' moviemaking debut, some additional applause is in order. The way the shots are framed and moved; the increasingly maddening editing and production design; the sounds that suck us in further... you name it and James has probably got it. The biggest strength, however, may be that of the three leading actresses (Robyn Nevin, Emily Mortimer, Bella Heathcote), each of a different generation with a different approach to the facts of the world; the elder woman vanishes for a brief time and confounding sights reveal themselves upon her return.Even at its most fantastical, Relic functions as a parable for losing someone to the confusions and rough realities of age. Even as the character of Edna seems to briefly pass into another plane of existence, surely that's not too different from how those final years often seem to us onlookers (soon to be given our own dues by Father Time)?The most effective parts of the movie have major influences from Mark Z. Danielewski's House of Leaves (which occupies my Top 3 books of all time alongside Cloud Atlas and The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy) but the maddening maze we're thrust into may yet represent the maze of the human mind, doomed to be impossible to navigate, or retrace, once we all reach that point. This is one of those films where I hope the younger and more mainstream horror fans stay clear, both for their own innocence's sake and for the sake of mature viewers' enjoyment.Much like The Lighthouse and It Comes At Night, this is a horror film that goes beyond what most are used to; it's not about weird monsters and gore, but about the fears and anxieties that we all share in common and yet might make us hate each other (at least in the case of those other two films, which concerned paranoia, isolation, and distrust). This is what horror can do to us if we let it. It needn't all be ghouls, masks, and pop scares - not that I mind the more simple entertainment within the genre, if it's done well.The pacing of Relic isn't the most fine-tuned and there are a few cheesy and inevitably clichéd moments; we do need to endure a few jump-scares but they are surprisingly effective here. A horror-based take on age and dementia is certainly an interesting one - even if the best movie on the subject will always be Haneke's Amour, which is more of a love story and an ultimate one at that.Still, by Jove, James needs to continue making movies and continue to tap into the fears that unite us all."
"3210","Relic",7,"A solid directorial debut. Give it a shot it is worth your time.","A solid debut for Natalie James. This is a slow burn horror that builds with each minute, and by the third act is full blown terror. All of the acting was surprisingly phenomenal, extremely impressed by Bella Heathcote. The third act is a fun ride, claustrophobic and even a little gore. Give it a shot, you wont be disappointed."
"3211","Relic",1,"This film is so deep...","...and yet so boring and totally pointless!Classed as an horror but there is nothing horrific apart from a woman suffering from alzheimer's and yet gives absolutely no insight in to that condition (last 10 minutes excluded when the film decides ohhh lets try to be an horror and yet still fails miserably - I get this is supposed to be an analogy of the former person but it doesn't work)Badly lit throughout, terrible dialogue, some off the cuff examples of losing your memory, obscure weird scenes that never connect up or seem to even have any relevance and never touched on again...the list goes onIf you want to see a film about alzheimer's then watch Still Alice - a real horror film without all the pretentiousness of this one"
"3212","Relic",8,"Disturbingly Beautiful","So apparently this movie made me cry:( but honestly the story goes into the depths of the human mind. It's so much more than it meets the eye."
"3213","Relic",1,"What a bore fest,,,,,,,","Just a whole film of nothingness....the annoyance of every shot in complete darkness makes it unwatchable..."
"3214","Relic",8,"Solid thriller","Lots of suspense and thrills in this film. Nicely acted and we'll written dialogue. The director, cinematographer, and editor deliver a well crafted horror film in a very artistic form. However.... The movie is too metaphorical for my taste. Overall I enjoyed it very much."
"3215","Relic",7,"Slow build with character and an emotional climax","Making movies for today's horror audience is a tricky proposition, but Relic impressed me with it's commitment to telling an emotional story that resonates with issues which you may recognise from our lives outside of the ""fantasy-horror"" tropes. The movie is a slow burn which devotes the majority of its time to establishing the central 3 characters (impressive performances), who make up 3 generations of women from an old family in an old house in rural Victoria. If you enjoy thoughtful film-making with a ""less is more"" approach, you'll be rewarded by a masterfully disturbing and shocking third act climax with an emotional kick that will give you closure but leave you thinking. It should be noted though, just the like characters in Relic, you'll have to give attention to the people in front of you to reap the rewards."
"3216","Relic",10,"Sundance 2020 world premiere","I just saw this at Sundance 2020 world premiere I didn't realize I was sitting behind the filmmaker! it was truly great! very great deep scary compassionate true blue #trueblueep #hummingbullrising"
"3217","Relic",1,"Super Boring","Do you know the word ""Boring"" is the worst thing you can say for any artwork ? Better say its not interesting or has no substance or not inspirational.One hour and 5 minutes into the movie and absolutely nothing has happened. I should have gone for take out food eat it have a bath and let the movie play.Im saving you 1 hour of your life. 3 women wondering doing nothing inside a house for an hour. I can do that myself. Why do I have to watch it in a movie ??Movies are made to entertain you keep you company have a good time and something to talk about. Nobody has ever talked about anything that is boring in the entire history of the world.Movie has faded colours, shot in darkness, no soundtrack, nothing happens. I have more fun relieving myself in the toilet than watching this movie.If this was a stage play in a theater there would be more people drinking soda in the lobby than people inside the theater. Probably I would throw empty cans of soda at the actors for doing nothing because I paid for a play and nothing happens.Excuse me people Im retiring to the toilet where I have more fun there. Or anywhere for that matter."
"3218","Relic",10,"Incredibly insightful","I'm surprised that people are giving this film negative reviews.
I read a review that read along the lines of 'I wish that I hadn't seen the last ten minutes' but, upon seeing the film, I realise that it is a compliment.
This film brilliantly projects the realism and growing awareness of dementia. The faith in loved ones lost, the distrust, the anger and frustration; but most of all, the unconditional love that is thrust upon you, particularly during times of family turmoil.
This film is riddled with metaphors and analogies of the disease dementia, plaguing even the most sound of minds to the point that the sane viwers doubt themselves, yet it is done in such a subtle methodology that you will be doubting your own sanity.
A truly deep conveyance in film, beyond superficial recognition that I would undoubtedly recommend.
10/10

"3219","Relic",7,"A Haunting Depiction of Mental Deterioration","Natalie Erika James has crafted a well made, purposeful, horror movie.When Edna (Robin Nevin) has not been heard from for a few days, her daughter Kay (Emily Mortimer) and her granddaughter Sam (Bella Heathcote) leave Melbourne to check on Enda at her house in the rural countryside. Edna is found only to see that her mental state is deteriorating as it starts to physically manifest itself within the house.Relic depicts the deterioration of the mind of an elderly woman and asks what would this be like if this manifested physically outside ones psyche. This movie is similar to The Babadook as it takes a mental illness and depicts it physically in the confines of the created world. This works very well at times creating a very suspenseful atmosphere and an engaging story. Where this movie falters however, is it breaks it's own physical rules that it establishes. Edna's daughter and granddaughter begin to experience some of the similar things that she is experiencing. I get this is trying to depict that mental illnesses such as dementia are hereditary, but in some instances what happened in the movie does not work. In The Babadook, the creature is a manifestation of the main characters depression that only physically effects her and everyone else experiences the direct result or direct effects of that depression. In this movie, the mental deterioration physically effects everyone else as well.This movie does create a very eerie atmosphere that carries the movie. This is complemented with good cinematography and a mostly haunting score that can sometimes be derogatory. The performances are mostly good but Robin Nevin, who plays the deteriorating old lady, gives a very creepy and dark performance. The movie is at its most interesting when exploring the effects of her mental state.The best thing going for Relic is it's suspenseful atmosphere combined with its engaging story. Besides the plot details mentioned above and some strange editing choices, Relic is an enjoyable movie. This is not something that will remain with me but I had a great time watching it."
"3220","Relic",4,"I hate to say it, it's boring.","I'm an Aussie, I like to supoort Australian films, but I couldn't watch it all.I found myself picking up my phone to check the time, and notifications. It's a slow burn. Unfortunately I found it it quite boring and stopped watching.A lot of effort goes into making a movie like this, and so it's sad to say this."
"3221","Relic",5,"Compelling premise and great acting","I found the premise to be quite novel and compelling - a rarity in modern horror cinema. The acting was very impressive. The female trio were very convincing with particular props to Robin Nevin who, at times was incredibly menacing.The biggest criticism for me is the poor lighting. I really struggled to see what was going on because the faces of the characters were so poorly lit and most of the time the rooms were in complete darkness. I get that this is a horror film and darkness can be a powerful tool but here I found it overkill to the point that it really hindered the viewing experience.I won't give away spoilers but I think that the ending could have been executed a little better. Great acting made up for certain inconsistencies/ holes in the script but it wasn't enough to really pull off the crescendo ending.Massive congrats to the director for their first film. It's great to see a fresh face on the Australian film scene and Relic was certainly a powerful debut."
"3222","Scott Pilgrim vs. the World",9,"A Delightfully Offbeat Comic Book Comedy","Scott Pilgrim vs. the World is probably as close as we'll come to having an experimental film released in theaters nationwide. This is one of the most innovative, original movies to come out in years. It's unlike anything I'd seen before. And yes, it is good, very good. I could not stop laughing the whole time.Onto the plot. Scott is something of a loser. He's socially awkward. He shares a mattress in a bunker-like apartment in Toronto with a sarcastic gossip king. He's in a band called the Sex Bob-Ombs, but they're really not that great. He also has a clinging, hyperactive girlfriend, ""Knives"" who's only 17- kind of a big deal when he's 22. All this changes when he dreams of a purple haired girl on roller blades. The very next day he finds out that she's real; that her name is Ramona flowers and she's the cool new girl in town. His first attempt to hook up fails miserably. His second attempt, although even more lamed brained, actually works, and they're soon an item. But now comes the bad news; to win her love, Scott must defeat her seven evil ex's. He also has an evil ex of his own. Plus, there's the matter of breaking up with Knives, and the battle of the bands is coming up!That's the setup, what follows is a hilarious romantic comedy punctuated by a series of completely over-the-top video game style fight scenes. Stylistically, I'd have to call them a cross between Sin City, Street Fighter and Viewtiful Joe. Each of the ex's has their own unique fighting style and their own super powers, such as vegan-powered telekinesis or summoning an army of stunt doubles. Often you hear martial arts movies criticized because the action is obviously computer aided. Here, that's the whole point.The movie's humor comes not only from the sheer ridiculousness of the situations, but also from the characters' reactions to them. After one of the ex's has flown in through a brick wall and battled Scott in the middle of a concert, everyone is just kind of weirded out. They don't act like nothing has happened, which would make it hard for the audience to suspend their disbelief, nor do they run screaming for the police, which would only complicate matters.Comedic effect is also generated through the use of deadpan dialog. For instance, when Knives confesses that she's never kissed a boy before, Scott replies, with a straight face ""It's okay, neither have I."" Or the band's self-introduction, ""We're the Sex Bob-Ombs and we're here to make you all sad and depressed and stuff.The movie also pokes gentle fun at hipster subculture with the way that Ramona has thirty plus flavors of tea, or how Scott's roommate is always texting. There are also quirky touches like one girl who can bleep herself out, much to Scott's amazement, and a scene when the intro from Seinfeld plays after the characters enter the apartment, and canned laughter follows every line.The editing and structure are highly non-traditional, with heavy use of dreams, daydreams, montages, animated flashbacks and asides, and chapter titles introducing segments. The visuals are impressive and very imaginative, such as the way that flashes of color accompany the playing of any musical instrument, allowing you to see the sound. Speaking of which, the sound is another high point, not only the energetic, rock fueled sound track, but also the sound effects taken from classic games like Mario and Zelda.Scott Pilgrim vs. the World succeeds in telling an offbeat story, providing interesting characters, and in producing lots of laughs. Other than a couple of too-obvious puns, I honestly can't think of anything wrong with this movie. I would highly recommend it to anyone in their teens or twenties. Four stars."

"3227","Scott Pilgrim vs. the World",9,"Terrific!","Scott Pilgrim versus the World is a Canadian romantic comedy and musical based on the comic books by Bryan Lee O'Malley. Scott Pilgrim is a 22y.o teen-age-looking insecure guy and guitarist who plays in a rock band called Sex Bom-omb and is going out with a minor high-school Chinese girl, Knives. He seems content until he has a dream about a girl. She happens to appear in his real world in the form of Ramona, the ever-changing-hair-colour American recently moved to Toronto. Scott is over the moon, but he has to face his own personal demons, break up with sweet Knives and fight for Ramona's love against her seven exes.Scott Pilgrim is one of the most refreshing teen-sophomore movies produced in the last years, and one the best movies of 2010. The movie is cute, funny, entertaining, has great characters, a terrific soundtrack and stunning visuals. The story is presented as in a video-game in which the main characters are the players, and their lives is the game. The issues regarding relationships are masqueraded by the video-game approach, but they have depth. Unlike many other movies focusing on the emotional challenges of very young people, sex is not the focus, although it does not avoid it either. The movie focus on how difficult is to make a relationship work when you fall in love whit people who already have an emotional baggage and you are insecure about yourself. Scott's fights against Ramona's exes are just a metaphoric way of putting it. Moreover, the emotions of the girl are not the focus here, but the emotions of a young man who is not obsessed with sex. How do you get a girl who has an emotional baggage when you are not an over-confident guy, your dream girl is uber-cool, and her exes were brilliant guys? The good thing is that any of this is boringly presented. On the contrary, the movie is lots of fun and does not take itself seriously.All the actors are great in their roles: Michael Cera as Scott, Mary Elizabeth Winstead as Ramona Flowers, Ellen Wong as Knives Chau; Mark Webber, Johnny Simmons and Alison Pill as the other band members Stephen, Young and Kim. Kieran Culkin is Scott's confident grounded gay Wallace Wells, Anna Kendrick as the know it all Scott's sister Stacey, and Jason Schwartzman as the revolting Gideon Graves. However, Cera really shines in this movie, in part because his physique really portraits the character from the start.The visuals of the movie are stunning, the camera's movement, the video-game and comic use of the screen adding to the freshness and originality of the film. The fights wit the exes are extremely funny and witty. I specially liked the fight with the Vegan ex-boyfriend, which is hilarious. Also visually stunning is the musical competition between Scott's rock band and the techno Asian twins band.The music is truly terrific. An extra bonus to a great script.Scott Pilgrim vs the Wold movie is not only well done but done with passion, a project cherished by the whole team and by director Edgar Wright.The movie has freshness, soul and a special something that stays with you longer after you've seen it! It is miles away from any other young people romantic comedy lately made."
"3228","Scott Pilgrim vs. the World",10,"Epic indeed","The tagline for this film is ""An Epic of Epic Epicness"" and I couldn't agree more. After waiting in line for 3 hours after last night's Comic-Con and finally being sat in the gorgeous Balboa Theater, I didn't know what to expect. I loved the comics and the previews looked faithful. The moment the movie starts (literally; the Universal logo and theme are 8-bit) you are thrown into a comic book atmosphere with video game references aplenty.The plot revolves around Scott Pilgrim needing to defeat the 7 Evil Exes of Ramona Flowers in order to date her and it is a harrowing sequence of battles. Each fight is crazier than the last and some are used purely for comedy, not excitement. Almost every other line is a punchline and they all work. References to TV shows, video games and comics (just like a 20-something's life would include) are everywhere and if you accept the concept of the plot, it all feels natural.While the audience might've been biased (we held a 10-minute standing ovation for Edgar Wright when the movie finished) there's no denying that it's an excellent film. Edgar Wright has an uncanny sense of comic timing with edits and sound cues to make the picture tight and focused when it's looking for laughs.I can't imagine a mainstream theater erupting in applause and laughter like ours did but make no mistake; this a crowd pleaser and the MOST enjoyable film I've seen in years. Don't hesitate to watch this masterpiece in a theater near you."
"3229","Scott Pilgrim vs. the World",NA,"Fun Film","There is some good fantasy, cool special effects and thin pretty girls who show a little bit of their attractive bodies.
More than that this film is original. I don't know what else i could compare this to. In a competitive area there is a grand event and it takes my breath away."
"3230","Scott Pilgrim vs. the World",8,"Pretty Sexy Babes and fun action","What more could anyone want??Action, fantasy, flaunting thin babes, different realities and did I mention hot chicks? Yes, stay away if you like superior realities. Otherwise, this is why I purchase DVDs."
"3231","Scott Pilgrim vs. the World",8,"Something unusually great","I came to this films with no preconceptions of it as a movie and I have to say I am glad. I guess I was expecting another Michael Cera movie about some dopey kid in love. And thats what it is ... but done in a unusually great way. For anyone under 25 brought up on gaming (I am 30 and not) this will be just brilliant. The style of the movie with its ""end of level baddies"", game-play set-up and visuals are a welcome and refreshing twist on what could have been a hum-drum movie. The music rocked, the comedy was fast, slick and laugh out loud ... I'd definitely recommend this to my friends looking for something that little bit special."
"3232","Scott Pilgrim vs. the World",8,"Brilliant","Really wish people would stop whining about these scarce entertaining films. This is a great film with superb effects and dreamy girls that I can actually fantasize about.
Adds up very nicely."
"3233","Scott Pilgrim vs. the World",8,"Fun.Evocative. Original","This film has everything. Violence, action, fantasy, pretty girls who spread it and does not stop delivering from start to finish."
"3234","Scott Pilgrim vs. the World",10,"Excellent, Brilliant !!!!!!! REFRESHING","This is truly a brilliant, refreshing movie. I must say that I didn't quite know what to expect but except that I thought this movie was for teenagers and I was terribly wrong. I am 40 years old and I TRULY enjoyed this movie and it had a clear story line that targeted more than just teenagers. In addition, I saw every age group, race, gender in the screening that I attended which was impressive and we all were jumping and laughing at every scene as if we were all teenagers. I truly left the movie saying that "" I cant wait to see more films put out by ""Oni Productions/Closed on Mondays "". Well done !!!!!"
"3235","Scott Pilgrim vs. the World",8,"One of Edgar Wrights finest","I was lucky enough too see this film during a test preview to an audience that weren't told what we were about too see. I was honestly expecting some odd film that really needed a lot of help but i was pleasantly surprised with how great this movie was.The movie had everyone laughing, and i mean everyone, I've been too almost every Wright film and somehow the audience wasn't as amused as i was, but this time everyone loved it. I've never heard so much laughter in one cinema.The jokes were fast and although silly, they weren't stupid which made for quite an enjoyable film. Wright's trademark quick cuts, and simple comedy made this film, i personally think if it were directed by anyone else it wouldn't have had the same effect.The characters were well written and performed, every individual character fitted perfectly. The film had many scenes that were quite pointless but still quite funny for example the Seinfeld scene.Apparently its based on a comic book series? I've never heard of them before but i certainly will look out for them now. If you're a fan of Edgar Wrights films or just good silly humour you will love this film.Great comedy, definitely the best of 2010 8/10 Morgan"
"3236","Scott Pilgrim vs. the World",NA,"Scott Pilgrim Has Everything","It is a video game-related film with zany moments, funny scenes, sexy girls and one cool main character. This one can be re-watched."
"3237","Scott Pilgrim vs. the World",8,"Fantastic!","Teenager problems (find yourself, get real, etc.) might not give anything to people considering themselves mayor adults, but consider this is a movie built on arcade video gaming motifs, I don't think it concerns mayor adults at all in the first place. I for one did not necessarily long for dark moral drama in this particular movie at all, I think the story was just about right for this movie, but you decide, if this is childish watch Haneke.Now for the rest: Surprisingly, Scott Pilgrim features the best martial arts scenes in years. Every fight is choreographed and executed in the most awesome ways and the fact that it's not Jet Lee pulling off these moves makes it even more fun to watch. And you get the fights absolutely frequently which is really, really satisfying. The editing is incredibly skillful as probably the most crucial element that makes this work. It gives the movie an incredible rhythm, reaching new levels of dynamism and the use of CGI and the visual design is plain fantastic. The amount of creativity put into this part is mind- blowing, resulting genuine and most original style. The cast is cool and I don't think anyone should look for academy material here. I liked these kids and they suit the movie.So, all together I found Scott Pilgrim being one of the most original, exciting and fun productions I've seen in my life. As a huge fan of things like fighting games, comics, or martial arts anime I felt satisfied to a point of screaming 'awesome' out loud after 30 minutes into the movie. Though people who never played Street Fighter or kept crossing fingers for Goku and friends yelling 'kamehameha' as evil bosses get pulverized by energy beams might not really get what Scott Pilgrim is about, it's very hard to deny the originality featured and the creative and professional qualities of the way it's executed.Fantastic! 8/10"
"3238","Scott Pilgrim vs. the World",9,"Crazy, stupid, awesome video game fun.","Scott Pilgram, a comic series unlike any other, is brought to insane life onto the big screen. When I first heard about this, I dismissed it as some lame movie, but to my surprise it isn't. This is one of the best movies with the word ""versus"" in the history of cinema. It's so absolutely mind-blowing that I can't tell if the author of the comics was tripping on acid when he made this.Now on to the plot: Meet Scott Pilgram, a teenage boy who has his own rock band, been in a few relationships, lives in an apartment with a homosexual roommate, and happens to be the best fighter in town. When he meets a mysterious hair-color-changing girl named Ramona, Scott suddenly falls in love. However, to be with Ramona, he has to defeat her seven evil ex's, each with their own skills and powers, in awesome and hilarious video game style brawls to the death.All I can say is that this film is pure freaking genius. Action-packed and incredibly stupid (in a good way). I wish I had fights like these, then my life would be complete! All the evil ex's are delightfully despicable, each having their own funny little quirks. This is a wonderful movie and I recommend that you check this out."
"3239","Scott Pilgrim vs. the World",8,"Break out the L word","For fans of all things geeky around the world, this film is for YOU! Comedy, action, romance, video games, music; ""Scott Pilgrim vs. The World"" has everything you could ask for. It very quickly became my favourite film after watching it and I could watch it over and over again without ever getting bored of it; the same way that you could watch the same episode of Friends for the 'nth' time and find it as hilarious as the first.Though the character feels quite different to his graphic novel counterpart, Michael Cera does an excellent job as the awkward Scott, Kieran Culkin is perfect as Wallace and Mary Elizabeth Winstead plays a much more tragic version of Ramona Flowers but this change still works well.Scott Pilgrim is a must-see and it deserves more recognition. Go watch it, you'll love it."
"3240","Scott Pilgrim vs. the World",8,"A audiovisual masterpiece.","Only a audiovisual masterpiece, all aspects, editting, cast, soundtrack and photografy, and ya ramona flowers is a egirl."
"3241","Scott Pilgrim vs. the World",10,"Original storytelling, impressive special effects and great cast make the perfect comic book/videogame nerd movie","It's been a while since I watched it and I forgot how much I love it. If like me you're into comic books and video games, you will absolutely have an amazing time. And even if you don't, you might find it silly but the great cast, original storytelling and top notch special effects should keep you extremely entertained!"
"3242","Scott Pilgrim vs. the World",10,"Such a great movie.","This is the perfect movie with perfect cast. I don't even like Michael Cera much, although he was fortunate enough to be in one of the most clever TV shows ever. He's become typecast, but this is one movie which breaks the mold. (Or at least it ignores it and does its own thing.) Edgar Wright has also directed the great movies ""Shaun of the Dead"" and ""Hot Fuzz,"" and he doesn't disappoint with this. I haven't read the anime series this was based on, but I don't really want to, because this is so much better than it could ever be. To be completely honest, the only thing I don't like his how fast Scott's 'pee bar' empties. Nobody can pee that fast, geez.But yeah, everyone should watch this, especially video game fans."
"3243","Scott Pilgrim vs. the World",10,"A Bold Masterpiece That Defies All Norms","Edgar Wright is a creative genius and crafts one of the most delightful pieces of entertainment that unites a set of insanely likable, charismatic characters, a unique visual style, a truly original plot, charming dialogue, nuanced comedy, innovative editing and a soundtrack that kicks ass.The story follows Scott Pilgrim, a 22-year-old guitarist who plays in a not-so-successful band and who seems to stumble from one social misadventure to the next. He starts off dating a 17-year-old but is soon enraptured by purple haired Ramona Flowers who works in delivery service. However, to be with her, he first needs to defeat her seven evil exes. This set-up, although seemingly ridiculous, paves the way for a film that captivates the viewer with its colourful set designs, smart dialogue and of course its over-the-top, awesomely choreographed fight scenes with video game aesthetics. Despite the exaggeration, the story never feels forced or contrived. Instead, it flows amazingly naturally and the comedy never falls flat, which is certainly also due to the superb performances of the cast. I couldn't praise this film enough. ""Scott Pilgrim vs. the World"" is one of these films that succeeds on every level. You see it once and immediately want to re-watch it. The creators obviously knew what they were doing and the result is a well-paced, highly entertaining film spiked with references to pop culture. It dares to be unconventional and geeky but never gets too absorbed in its references. The film knows when to be quiet and when to be loud but most of all, it doesn't take itself too seriously, granting an out of this world, two hour spectacle that couldn't be more epic."
"3244","Scott Pilgrim vs. the World",4,"I really wanted to love it. But I can barely even bring myself to like it.","Scott Pilgrim vs. The World has made me question just how well I fit in with my generation. According to other members of my generation, it is the movie to end all movies, and the best movie... I'm sorry... most EPIC movie ever. I'm partial to The Godfather myself. Scott Pilgrim is a film that I was looking forward to as Michael Cera has made me laugh numerous times in the past, and Edgar Wright is easily one of the more talented newer directors working today. Combined with the eye-popping visual effects, I couldn't see how these things could add up to anything less than a fun and entertaining film. Fun, to a point. Entertaining? Well...Scott Pilgrim's first problem is the plot. The plot is self-conscious and repetitive, as well as overly laid back and easygoing. Scott Pilgrim has to defeat his new girlfriend's seven evil ex's. That's the whole plot, and at no point do we get the sense that anything is at stake for these characters. I know that probably shouldn't matter in an effects-driven popcorn movie, but with nothing to root for, or no suspense of any kind, I found the film to get boring after the first thirty minutes. That is approximately when the first evil ex shows up. They fight. He defeats him easily. Too easily. The fight isn't all that exciting as a result. And with six of these to go, the movie became a tedious experience before it was even halfway over.Not to say the film doesn't have it's good points. Michael Cera, though not as witty as he can be, is still somewhat likable. And while the script lacks structure of any kind, it is jam- packed with hilariously quirky dialogue and brilliant sight gags. The filmmaking is generally good throughout, and as a director Edgar Wright hasn't lost his talent. Unfortunately, the poor storyline ultimately overshadowed these elements for me. Maybe it's because I don't play video games. Maybe I just need to read the comics. Or maybe I'm just becoming less fun of a person as I mature. I want to like this movie and take the same joy from it that my generation does, but I simply can't. I'll stick to films with stories and social relevance and enjoy being the outcast. Scott Pilgrim Vs. The World gets a generous 5/10 because I feel giving it anything lower would just make me look bitter."
"3245","Scott Pilgrim vs. the World",9,"One of the Best of 2010","'Scott Pilgrim vs. the World' was executed from a graphic novel to a film very nicely but didn't make it a better film. The movie was great but from comic to movie really didn't make it any better although it probably wasn't intended to make it better. This film exceeded all of my expectations and actually surprised me that a comic like this type could be made into a movie so nicely done. I immediately picked up the graphic novels and it explained a huge amount of references that never got displayed in this movie. I really really liked Michael Cera's performance in this and he continues to be exceptional. The film's tagline ""An epic of epic epicness"" really defines the film for what it is. It was funny, intense, and serious while it has it's own style of a film itself. 'Scott Pilgrim' had it's own type of humour, the intense fight scenes that were really fun to watch and see the creativity of the authors point of view. This is a fun movie and must see."
"3246","Scott Pilgrim vs. the World",10,"Awesome","I have never, ever wrote a review before even though i have watched a insane amount of movies in my time (Roughly a Million). As far as video games are concerned i have won a Nintendo Championship yeah thats right i remember those days. This movie to me stomps the best story lines out there, Crush's action films like ""The Matrix"". Overall this is where ""Film"" should be going.If you remember what it is like to be a kid and your a adult now, you and your kid(s) can watch this together. Trust me it's worth it, We all love a good drama story and thats exactly what this is. Sure they threw a awesome amount of action in there but isn't that needed so men and women can enjoy a film together these days? Oh and lets not forget the awesome way the music was brought into this storyline Kudos! MAD prop's goes out to Michael Cera dude you have brought me over to your fan base. Good call on the 100% flawless cheat code. I PRAY! there is a sequel to this movie and i hope it earns awards.Peace for now Xavier"
"3247","Coma",8,"I really liked this Russkie sci-fi flick!","Hard to believe this is amateur writer/director Nikita Argunov's 2nd writing and 1st directing credit! For an international film, its production was top notch with stunning visuals. You can pretty much pause any frame and print off an amazing sci-fi poster. The acting was great, the score very fitting, and the length and pacing just right. It certainly isn't worth the low rating and the negative reviews comparing it to Inception. Sure, maybe the same concept, but a different story, and that's not a bad thing. It's like giving every cop movie after the first one ever made a 1/10 because it's been done already. Those people are the wannabe critics. Nevertheless, if your a sci-fi fan, this is a great film, and the subtitles aren't difficult to follow. A well deserved 8/10 from me."
"3248","Coma",6,"Interesting","Story plot, although it feels like a mash up of inception and matrix. Probably a bit too long or slow at times but nice effects and plot twists."
"3249","Coma",9,"Mind-blowing for a Russian csi-fi movie","I wasn't expecting much after all the failed Russian attempts to produce a good sci-fi movie. I was properly surprised in a good way. Yes, it has a lot of allusions to memorable Hollywood productions like Inception, The Matrix, Memento, Divergent, also at some points Tarkovsky's Stalker. But at the same time it's fresh and new in a way, and seeing what The Matrix evolved into, this one still has a good potential for a better continuation and the evolution of the philosophical idea behind it."
"3250","Coma",8,"The Stalker is back!","Sure, the film can be compared to ""Inception"", and in this respect it has little to offer that is new. However, when you remember Russian SF classics of the sixties and seventies, you can see that there are links to the Strugazki brothers and especially to Tarkovsky's masterpiece ""Stalker"". This reveals a powerful, original, almost forgotten Russian SF tradition."
"3251","Coma",10,"Mind blowing","Good effects, interesting storyline and philosophic approach make this movie a must watch."
"3252","Coma",7,"An universe that we've never been to before!","Before I say anything, watch this movie. If you are someone who is impressed by the world that a movie built around than this movie is a great one. My only issue with it is they didn't take advantage of this unprecedented world. If Marvel had any hand in this movie, I could see them making a huge franchise out of it. Still, watch it. It is something you have never seen before."
"3253","Coma",9,"Very enjoyable film with super effects","Considering this film was made on a not-so-high budget, this was a remarkable and excellent film.The story line was very good, the special effects weren't special, they were superb!Nothing like Inception by the way. More like a fantasy sci-fi film that was action from start to finish.Recommend this film highly."
"3254","Coma",10,"Just fantastic!","I hardly ever write a movie review, but this time I have to because if Inception scores above 8 on IMDB (after all, one of the best movies ever), Koma should right be there sitting on the throne next to it! From other reviews I knew I could expect something similar, but the story is yet so different, yet so fantastic. It grabs you from the start and doesn't let go till the very end. A must-see for every Inception-fan."
"3255","Coma",10,"WOW. Very impressed.","No graphic violence, no gore, no sex scenes, political bias, etc. Very good movie. Actually million times better of any scifi made in the last couple of years. 10/10"
"3256","Coma",10,"Unlike some opinions, this is unrelated to Inception!","I really don't get why some people think this movie was made after Inception! I would say this is much better as a concept!
The movie is absolutely brilliant It's got everyhting for a straight 10!"
"3257","Coma",8,"EXOTIC","Russian movies are always fascinating, especially sic-fi movies, the visual effects are really powerful. Its story is ok, the visual effects are great but there is room to improvement."
"3258","Coma",7,"Weirdly watchable......","""Koma (Coma)"" is a weirdly watchable sci fi horror from Russia.This is a strangely disconcerting watch. Its presentation of a reality bending dream world, is a little hard on the synapses, until you become accustomed to its quirky nuances.That said, its convincing back story, decent characterisations and sustained action, mark this film out, as a worthwhile watch. It has a very subtle ""hint"" rather than twist in the end too, that adds a further note of reality questioning discordance, that's quite effective.Definitely one to consider, if you want a departure from conventional sci fi fare.7/10."
"3259","Coma",10,"Really enjoyable movie, wow","Living in the UK I always assumed only Hollywood made movies of this quality, and SFX. And any review saying it's like inception, so what? It's like saying all heist, spy or slasher movies aren't worth watching if you've seen one movie! This film was entertaining, great story and ideas. I would recommend. I hope Netflix releases it with dubbing. I want to find other Russian movies now, I've almost run out oh Hollywood films!"
"3260","Coma",9,"Spiritual successor to The Matrix (idea and groundbreaking visuals wise)","If this was a Hollywood production it would be a blockbuster. Not to pump up your expectations too much but it's an original idea (rare thing lately) with flawless execution.Story is great, acting is good (excellent from some, moderate from others), pace picks up quickly with some time jumps that become clear later on, and the effects, they are on a different level. One can see that the director has huge experience in VFX as there are some pretty trippy visuals throughout.Note to anyone on the crew or a native russian speaker - the english subtitles need some improvement. I did understand the movie but some lines are translated exactly as in russian and make little to no sense.Note to everyone else - go and watch this movie. You will not regret it."
"3261","Coma",1,"Might be the worst movie I have ever seen.","Got caught by a nice psychodelic images in the trailer, so chose this one over some other mediocre title to go see at the movie. I've expected it to be ""not that great"", but what I've actually experienced was really beyond anything I could possibly expect. After 15-20 minutes my face hurt like hell of constant facepalming, which I just couldn't stop doing.Nothing in the movie makes sense. Everything in it is a cliche of a copy of a cliche in the worst possible meaning of it. The plot, that is trivial and still illogical and dumb, the predictably stupid actions of characters and interactions between them, for gods sake even the nicknames of characters, which were a total cliche, but moreover still don't make any sense in this movie - all these things make you puke and constant feeling of Spanish shame and pain from facepalming make the experience even worse.Watching this movie is a total waste of time, money and brain sells. The story doesn't devellope throughout the movie... I mean if you could call it a story. The characters also don't develop in any way and behave like bots for an 8-bit game - no logic, no rational or emotional justification - they just to what they do. The rules of the world, although being silly and illogical from the very beginning, change from scene to scene with ease, just to fit the current scene. And just really the worst cliche every other minute, like for example a group of heros, being chased by a monster and spitting ""aaahhh we need to hurry!"" every second, suddently stops to discuss some irrelevant bullcrap for the next 10 minutes.The only reason to watch this movie could be only if you're making a list of the worst movies of all ages. You might really have a winner here. But be prepared to lose a lot of brain cells in the process."
"3262","Coma",7,"Between The Matrix and Inception but with his own ideas","I was not a big fan of STALKER or SOLARIS both considered Tarkovsky masterpieces; but considering Asimov was one of the greatest sci fi writers I give now and then a chance to Russin SciFiI saw Attraction few years ago and recently The Blackout and the second part of Attraction (Invasion). I had to admit; Russian FX and digital imagery have a very good quality; however stories are not that good in terms of intrigue and resolution but are able to take some old ideas and rework them very good.
Koma (COMA) is another example.Taking some imagery and concepts from Inception and The Matrix; this movie is able to be different in itself and quite interesting if you are able to go beyond the first part; which does not seems to make a lot of sense; some events seem absurd or unnecessary. After a while; when ideas are clarified the logic kicks in.Not much can be said about the story; because it will spoil part of the suspense; but let's only explain that the main character gets in a coma because of an accident and wakes up in a oniric universe with strange laws of physics and meets a group of people trying to survive there; things start twisting after a while.Sadly the last part of the movie seems quickly resolved and lazy written; but the whole package is still interesting"
"3263","Coma",8,"Fine First Film","How original are today's films? Hard to say. With Netflix already corrupted, its offer lost much of its novelty and originality (even its production model is a ""remake""). Many people fled to Instagram and left Facebook, which took over Instagram and now it's all the same. So the names of stars and dinosaur directors do not guarantee nada... n-o-t-h-i-n-g.Last night, I was watching «Koma» and I thought, ""Well, these Russian filmmakers are doing quit original and engaging things,"" and it didn't take long before someone said, ""Nolan already did that."" In truth, I never cared to watch moren than 10 minutes of «Inception», but so what if Nolan did something similar before? In any case, I do not know what he did, and I do not care. I am reluctant to devalue any science-fiction movie different that improves the repetitive and chauvinistic Anglo-Saxon products, the more so if they are better, as formulaic as they all are.Somewhere I wrote that if you want to force a high rating and compare the Russian science-ficion movies with «Solaris» or «Stalker», you'd better open your Tarkovskian Bibles and watch another channel, because «Koma» is a lively commercial adventure show, with good visual effects and unknown faces, at least for to me, except for the leading actor, Rinal Mukhametov, who stood out as the alien in the awesome «Attraction» (2017).First film by a visual effects creator Nikita Argunov, this time Mukhametov is an architect who, after a grim job interview with the suspicious New Life Foundation, suffers an accident (induced, perhaps) and, in a coma, enters a world where several comatose persons' memories coincide and cohabit. Soon he is rescued by a group of guerrillas, whose leader needs him to design a paradisiacal island for all those who have entered this universe, without the threat of the fearsome Reapers. There is only one prohibition: to penetrate the realm of dreams (for a reason that I will not reveal so as not to spoil the journey).Complain about the music, it is justified, because it sounds like Hollywood pastiche, but otherwise enjoy this quest, with a good dose of melodrama and a melancholic vision of human nature."
"3264","Coma",5,"There´s more than the trailer","Besides the obvious fact that the ""Koma"" creators are big fans of ""Inception"", there´s more to see than the trailer scenes with the slightly outdated visual effects. The story keeps the viewer attracted and it really helps that the film is only 1 hour 45 instead of all the 2 hours 30 blockbusters. Of course there are a lot movies I´d recommand instead of watching ""Koma"". But if you need a simple and entertaining film after a hard day at work I think you can give it a try."
"3265","Coma",10,"Wow","Finally something worthwhile from the Russians! Of course there are bloopers, but the movie dragged on! Looked in one breath! I really hope to continue, it begs for it at the end of the film"
"3266","Coma",10,"Death Stranding + Inception","But really good movie, logical and consistent plot, interesting characters"

"3270","Coma",6,"-","The Russians wanted to make a copy of the inception, but.... they failed to do it. Film was too banal and everything was known how it would end."
"3271","Coma",9,"Great sci-fi movie.","This movie is better than any Hollywood sci-fi movie iv'e seen in a long time. The CGI is very good, and they created a really Amazing and convincing world. The acting is also pretty good. I was Surprised how well this Russian Sci-fi worked. A must see for sci-fi fans."
"3272","Interstellar",10,"Who trusts Oscars anymore after they ignored this masterpiece???","The best movie I ever saw and I watched hundreds off them from Godfather, Pulp fiction, The green mile, The pianist, Schindler's list, Rear window, The shining, Alien etc. What can you ask more: space exploration, apocalyptic earth, emotions, tears, time manipulation, amazing visuals, maybe the best music score, touching acting, everything you want. SHAME on all the oscar ""experts""!"

This without doubt is THE BEST MOVIE EVER MADE"
"3274","Interstellar",10,"Best movie I have seen in my life","This movie was the best written, acted, visual effected, etc. movie. This movie was the best movie I have ever seen. I am a huge Christopher Nolan fan and this movie was his finest. Matthew McConaughey turned in his best performance of his lifetime. Anne Hathaway was an amazing supporting actress and compared to her performance in Les Miserables, I have no idea how she didn't get an Oscar for this. The visual effects were more than just Oscar worthy. They were pioneering. I have never seen anything like it. One thing I would recommend is having a little previous knowledge about space. Not like Einstein stuff though. I would recommend you see this movie as fast as you can if you are a Nolan fan or not. I give this movie a rating of 97 out of 100."
"3275","Interstellar",10,"Excellent Movie","I judge a movie by how long it takes me to realize I need the bathroom, how long the movie can hold my interest and how convincing the events unfolding are. Well, I watched this movie all the way through with no bathroom breaks. My interest was grabbed from the start and held all the way through. Being old enough, and lucky enough to have watched the premiere of 2001 A Space Odyssey - and viewed it several times since - of course I made comparisons, and there were a few, but this movie tells an excellent stand alone story that is both riveting and believable. I'm not going to give away any secrets but anyone who watches the last five minutes or so without a lump in their throat and a tear in their eye, well you're a critic, you're not enjoying the movie because you're too busy looking for bloopers and faults. Were there bloopers and faults? The darn movie was so riveting if there were any I didn't notice them!"
"3276","Interstellar",10,"Glad i didn't watch the trailer","Interstellar - ReviewCertain things in life are precious. Very precious. And so was the Film for me.Why you might ask?Well seldom do i get the chance where i find myself sitting in a cinema anxious and intrigued by what might come. In a time where trailers are omnipresent and going to the movies without having seen one seems unreasonable, outright stupid to some i had the magical chance to find myself in front of the IMAX on a cold November night with 2 tickets to Interstellar. My only knowledge was that Nolan directed it and McConaughey stars in it.The images were brilliant the acting was top notch and everything was blended together by Hans Zimmer and his Music. 169 minutes flew by me with my eyes fixed on the screen and my heart racing. And there it was.. The ending. I couldn't believe it . I was reliving, rethinking the movie while the credit scenes rolled enjoying the moment, the smell of popcorn, my comfortable seat and what do i see next to me? Ninety percent of the people in the cinema rushing outside after the first second of the credit scenes. .. .Well apparently people enjoy movies different than i do. Maybe i should start watching trailers again :)."
"3277","Interstellar",10,"Nolan's masterpiece, one of the best sci-fi movie","I have been a cinema lover for years, read a lot of reviews on IMDb and everywhere, and never found the right movie to write my first review. I always thought I would wait for THE movie.And this is IT!When I first heard that Nolan was preparing a sci-fi movie, I felt like a kid again, waiting for his Christmas gift under the tree. I knew it would become a classic. And I'm sure it will.First of all, it is incredibly beautiful to watch. Honestly, it was so beautiful that I felt like I was sucked into the movie. The way Nolan decided to show some scenes really remind me of 2001 A Space Odyssey (actually many things will probably remind you of this movie). We can feel the talent of Christopher Nolan, just by looking at the way it is filmed. The techniques he used contribute to create that visual environment in a believable way.The sound environment is just mesmerizing. It is a very important part of the movie, because some scenes take place in space, and Noland just found the right way to use sound. The soundtrack (made by the great Hans Zimmer) is breathtaking, epic, amazing, unreal. I could find a lot more adjectives to qualify it, but you have to hear it to understand how epic they are. These two important parts (image and sound) create a stunning atmosphere. You will forget you are in a movie theater, and you will be lost in space, sucked into the adventures of this new Space Odyssey, begging for more. It is a truly unique experience. I can say that I have never felt something like that in a movie theater (at least not for the past ten years).Then, of course, the cast. First of all, Matthew McConaughey. I discovered this actor in Tropic Thunder, but he didn't really convince me, though he was quite funny. Then I saw Dallas Buyers Club. Since that movie, I love him. In this movie... Well, he is the movie. I exaggerate a bit, since there are other great actors (some even unexpected with a special guest) who play extremely well. But he is just what was needed to feel the human part of the story (which is very important in Interstellar). He is capable of making us feel so many different emotions all along the story, as a father, as a human. Anne Hathaway was very convincing, all together the actors managed to create some harmony, which makes the human interactions credible. Caine, Chastaing and Affleck are a perfect choice. And then there is... The special guest, I will call him ""X"". His role, which could be seen as a minor role, is actually much more important than that. He proves, once again, that he is a great actor. Watch and see.And finally, the scenario/story. I won't spoil anything here; I'll just try to convince you how great it is. Nolan is known to revolutionize everything when he tries a new genre in cinema. Well, once again he did it. With The Dark Knight he revolutionized the superhero genre. With Interstellar he's revolutionizing the sci-fi genre in cinema. From what I heard, he worked with a physicist (in gravitational physics and astrophysics) to help him with that movie. And we can feel and see it. During the fifties, Asimov laid the foundations of modern science fiction. Lucas and Kubrick did the same in cinema. Today, Nolan is laying the new foundations of the genre in cinema, proving that cinema is still at the beginning of what can be done (brace yourselves my friends, we have not seen anything yet). Why? Well, simply because we only know a few things about space, some things can't be proved for the moment, so we can use theory, and make the best of it. That is exactly what Nolan did. He used theories that exist today, and made a movie about mankind, about pioneers, about humanity, about us.Because, in spite of all the sci-fi aspect, it is a story about humanity. McConaughey, Hathaway, and mainly ""X"", will managed to convince you about that.My rating for this movie can only be a 10, because in itself, it is a beginning for a new kind of cinema. It IS a classic. Those who say ""we can't compare this movie to 2001 Space Odyssey, nor can we compare Nolan to Kubrick"" are wrong. We can, and we should. Talented people don't live only in the past, some genius live today, among us. And Nolan is one of them. Many say that he is overrated. I truly don't think so. Only time will answer that.This is the sci-fi movie of the decade, and probably the best movie Nolan ever made. Just go for it, without a second thought."
"3278","Interstellar",10,"A visual and auditory marvel","Interstellar is a movie like no other. Unlike many apocalyptic sci-fi films that feature advanced technology as the source of our destruction (ala The Terminator movies), it instead asserts that technology will save us.Not everyone in Interstellar recognizes the potential of advanced technology. Most dismiss it as a waste of time and resources, and not just old curmudgeons feel this way. Thoughtful, intelligent young characters share this sentiment. This belief gained steam following a world-wide blight that wiped out the vast majority of life on earthcrops and humans.Farming became paramount while advanced technology was deemed frivolous. Cooper (McConaughey) remains one of the few survivors who still appreciates the need for engineering. He feels like a man lost in time, until he stumbles into the headquarters of NASA (which had been operating in secret due to public disapproval). Here he meets others who realize that a return to our old ways is unsustainable and will ultimately lead to our demise. We need technology to save us. As Michael Caine, playing the brilliant (duh!) Professor Brand, eloquently tells Cooper, ""we were never meant to save the world. We were meant to leave it."" For a movie that won an Oscar for Best Visual Effects (and deservedly so) the sound stole the show. Hans Zimmer (Dark Knight Trilogy) unleashed a performance that was, quite appropriately, out of this world. Never have I seen a movie elevated so much by its score. The sound literally took my breath away. Forgive me for the next paragraph. I will gush irresponsibly about the magic that is this movie's sound. Skip it if you please. You have your warning.The music fueled every important scene. In every meaningful moment Zimmer's harmonies captivated watchers' attention in the way of a coach commanding a locker room with a pregame speech. The music elucidated those emotional scenes, particularly ones featuring Cooper and his daughter, in a way that no words or visual ques possibly could. I sat frozen, jaw agape, with tears pouring down my cheeks as the music completely overwhelmed my emotions. The sound penetrated my soul and reverberated through my body, flowing to my appendages, supplying me with life like a heartbeat pumping blood through my veins. The music was truly the life force of movie.Yes, we all witnessed a visual triumph, a daring creative wonder the likes of which we haven't encountered since Inception. Yes, nearly every actor's performance proved worthy of commendation. McConaughey is on fire. Chastain is blossoming into a star. At this point Michael Cain exudes such knowledge and wisdom by merely appearing on screen that if he were cast as Albert Einstein, people would wonder if the role were beneath him. All this considered, and the sound still towered over everything.I walked out of the theater believing that I had experienced something unique, something truly special. Interstellar inspires, it awes, and above all it entertains. I cannot ask for more than that."
"3279","Interstellar",10,"The best film I have ever seen","All is amazing. I can't describe anything. It's a film that leads you to think about yourself and your plans in your life. I am a real series/movies' lover and... This was awesome."
"3280","Interstellar",10,"Mankind Achievement","THIS IS A MANKIND ACHIEVEMENT.THE BEST MOVIE EVER MADE.IS ANYONE HAS DOUBT?"
"3281","Interstellar",10,"Interstellar : An open-hearted & mastered Human Odyssey","The film begins by establishing at his own rhythm its ambitions: men overexploited land resources, which is why the only goal they have left is to survive. This life is not enough for Cooper, brilliantly played by McConaughey who gave body and soul to this character. But all of this wouldn't hold without the total control of Christopher Nolan, based on the languishing soundtrack by Hans Zimmer, the luminous and impenetrable photography of Hoyte Van Hoytema, and the sincerity of Nolan's directing. He manages to film the characters and to find the right cut at the right time, always in harmony with Hans Zimmer's soundtrack, to give the film an aspiring and inspiring dimension that went missing for many many years. Thus we are transported into the same cockpit that Cooper, we feel the same remorse that he can already feel, we feel the same gravity, and we feel the same fear of the unknown melted with the force of his will. All of this is brilliantly illustrated in a very simple directing choice, which from my point of view is the decisive impetus of the film: to directly jump from when Cooper leaves in his truck, leaving his family behind him, to Endurance taking off. This simple editing decision allows Nolan to give an original movement to his film, and the musical crescendo makes us physically feel the sentimental break between two parts of the film.You don't necessarily have to understand it immediately : The film will raise questions in you, such as : what is it to be a human being, is there some physical limitations to our humanity, how far could we be willing to go to determine knowledge, is there other dimensions that we can not access to, and above all: what is the nature of this intact and immutable bond that unites us to others wherever we are in the universe ? Is this bond only intelligible, or is it also tangible ? All these questions resonate in harmony in Nolan's Interstellar. Interstellar is itself a crescendo, increasing sensitivity and creativity. I use the term deliberately because it goes crescendo with the soundtrack by Hans Zimmer, which is one of the most beautiful music ever scored for a sci-fi movie. We are witnessing a perfect musical arrangement, a total symbiosis, a bit like the music of Gravity which had understood very well how to match the image and the rhythm of a sequence to its own musicality. Zimmer's crescendos are giving a new powerful breath to every new scene, whether it is in visually powerful & intense moments or in more intimate moments; it intrudes into our momentary feelings and sensations, and manages to extend them, sometimes almost to choking, before resting on the balance of the film frame along with our mind spell-bounded. I have seen all the talent of the director that I knew he was outside the norm, but whom I did not know his capacity to reinvent itself. Because this is it: Interstellar is not an action movie, not really a blockbuster, and it goes not entirely but mostly again the expectations of common people. It's much more than that. This is much more than just a sci-fi movie. It is unlike any of his previous films. Some hoped to see Interstellar as Christopher Nolan's best film, and they were disappointed that this was not the case. And indeed, THIS IS NOT THE BEST FILM of Christopher Nolan. Because in a way, IT IS HIS FIRST FILM. I'm not saying that Interstellar is not as good as his other films, it goes beyond all of them. But to me Interstellar is the first film of a new stage in Nolan's filmography ; it is a masterpiece as it the beginning of a work ahead. Interstellar is the proof that Nolan has finally managed, despite all the expectations that were placed on him after the success of The Dark Knight, to move away from his own reputation to create a personal work, original, humble, sincere and deeply, meticulously, measured.Now, in this third act of the film, it all comes to life with unparalleled strength. Nolan poses and answers questions that raise others. But he focuses his attention on the great mystery of love, that emotional bond that can unite men and sometimes separate them. But Nolan is the only one that can successfully speak of love from a being to another in a film that mainly takes place in a another galaxy. From my point of view, only Solaris by Steven Soderbergh (2002), unfortunately neglected by the audience, was able to accomplish that. Interstellar is based on a premise which is the following : from terrestrial dust to the depths of space and time, we can never be separated from who we are as individuals and as a species, as we always leave a part of ourselves ""behind"" us. In other words, I could say that this is a human story, and even if we go as far as we want to, if we travel through the universe believing that we can be detached of the one we are fond of, we will only get closer to them. Because the separation, and thus the distance and time, can only ultimately reinforce the relationship between the people who really love each other. Because it is going to the end of the world, when we reach the end of ourselves, that we reach the singularity of the ""black hole beyond the horizon"" * : it is our humanity. No, I wasn't been able to find any bad flaws in the film. Not one, and I'm still looking. After all, Interstellar is like gravity, ""all it takes is a little push ! ""*you'll have to see the movie to figure that one out.Félix Tardieu, November 1st, 2014"
"3282","Interstellar",NA,"A Visually Monumental And Thoughtful Sci-Fi Epic","I was extremely lucky to get the chance to see this film upon its first day release, before entering the cinema, my expectations were already high, after all, this was a film from the cinematic genius who brought us the likes of 'Inception' and 'The Dark Knight', to summarise the following review in a single sentence: I left the cinema in extreme awe from the visual masterpiece I had just viewed. A film that explores the psychological and emotional state of a man whose life revolves around his family, 'Interstellar' is a thrilling and thought-provoking film that boasts an intellectual story masterfully written by the Nolan brothers. Whilst there seems to have been influence from films like '2001: A Space Odyssey' and 'Apollo 13', 'Interstellar' is unique in its own way. Whilst the subject may be hard to comprehend at times, it can't be denied how visually monumental and thoughtful Christopher Nolan's epic science fiction masterpiece is, and can easily be named the best film of this year and possibly one of the greatest science fiction films to have ever graced the screen. A sheer brilliant feat of cinema."
"3283","Interstellar",9,"An Emotional, Beautiful Journey into the Unknown","(This is both a review of the film, and an assertion of Christopher Nolan's filmmaking style)There have been many reviewers and critics alike that have high praise for the film (the visual effects, the acting, the music), but say how it's not Christopher Nolan's best directed film. This is where i personally would have to disagree. Before i get into it, though, i'll talk about Interstellar a bit.Interstellar is truly a sci-fi epic like no other. To compare said film to '2001: A Space Odyssey' isn't just a disservice, but unnecessary. The films are almost nothing alike, simply sharing small plot elements. Also, Stanley Kubrick's vision of Arthur C. Clarke's sci-fi epic wasn't to ponder the philosophical questions that accompanied the story, but to make art, and art is was, and is. With Interstellar, Mr. Nolan set out to make his most personal and emotional film to date about love and time (time being a recurring theme throughout all of Nolan's films). But it's so much more than that too. There are no words to express the epic journey Nolan takes us on in the film, but needless to say, it's tear-jerking and emotional throughout. The acting is top-notch, especially McConaughey, who gives (I would say) his most emotional performance yet. But the actor who stole the show in a few scenes (one in particular, when they're on an alien planet) was David Gyasi as Romilly, one of the astronauts aboard the Endurance, their spacecraft. The musical score from Hans Zimmer is, without a doubt, his best and most influential work to date, helping drive the film's bold and breath-taking vision (the church organ helped significantly). The visual effects are easily the best to date as well, and of the year. To see a black hole created through visual effects in such a way, with pages theoretical equations provided by Kip Thorne (theoretical physicist, of whom's work inspired the film's genesis); what you see in the film is the most realistic depiction of a black hole, and even offered new insight to accretion discs surrounding the anomalies. But even everything else, from the alien planets to the Endurance, the visuals always look real. Then, there's the writing. I would definitely have to say this has some of the best dialogue i've ever heard in a sci-fi movie, and the script continually pours or oozes emotion, keeping the audience tethered to the film.Now, about Mr. Nolan. Don't just look at Nolan, but look at his films. Some say Inception would be his masterpiece, while others would say it's The Dark Knight, or Memento. But honestly, every single film Christopher Nolan has directed is a masterpiece not of its genre, but of Nolan. Following is his quiet masterpiece, not the film that put Mr. Nolan on the map as a phenomenal director, but one people visited or revisited after becoming accustomed to Nolan, after seeing Memento, what could be called his breakout masterpiece. Then, right after, he directed the remake of the Norwegian thriller, Insomnia. This, too, could be considered a masterpiece, even if a remake. Then, we were given his take on the Batman universe, starting with Batman Begins, the origin masterpiece. Then, there's The Prestige, adapted from the novel of the same name, which can be called his dark masterpiece. The Dark Knight, his bold masterpiece; Inception, his complex masterpiece, and The Dark Knight Rises, his flawed masterpiece. Now, we have Interstellar, his emotional or personal masterpiece.This is just my looking at Nolan and his films, but whatever your thoughts are, you can't deny Interstellar is one hell of a journey. He certainly is one of the best filmmakers of our time, and of all time. I can't wait to see what he does next, but i'm not sure it will be as emotionally powerful as Interstellar."
"3284","Interstellar",10,"'Interstellar'","'Interstellar' was incredible. The visuals, the score, the acting, were all amazing. The plot is definitely one of the most original I've seen in a while. Most of the critic reviews have said that some bits are a little too unbelievable, but I have to disagree. Yes, there were some parts that were definitely in the ""fi"" part of sci-fi. But the thing is, 'Interstellar' deals with concepts that we know very little about. We have no idea what the 4th or 5th dimension is like, or what it would be like to go through a wormhole or a black hole. I don't think it's fair to call something unbelievable, when we have absolutely no idea what WOULD be believable in those circumstances. Either way, excellent writing from the Nolan brothers. The visuals were outstanding, and will no doubt be nominated for an Oscar. The performances were excellent, though nothing Oscar worthy, as is the case with most of Nolan's films ('The Dark Knight' being the obvious exception). Hans Zimmer's score was amazing and blended perfectly with the film. All in all, 'Interstellar' is an excellent movie, which I personally think is Nolan's most beautiful film to date."
"3285","Interstellar",10,"I would rate 11/10","I hadn't seen this but movie and caught it on a flight back from the DR. 
One of my favorite movies of all time. I would give the first half of the movie an 11/10, just completely enjoyed it as a sci fi/ thriller(in the sense of so much always being on the line). I loved the acting and just yeah, a great movie and one you should go see if you never have"
"3286","Interstellar",10,"A Love Story Against The Backdrop Of A Grand Interstellar Travel","Love is the one thing that transcends time and space... New creation of Christopher Nolan's genius, whose name is now known to everyone. His films are waiting with a special look, because it offers something that every day, unfortunately, less and less can be found in the world of mass cinema - an interesting spectacle, filled with meaning, ideas and emotions. At this time, Christopher decided to send us not to the world of dreams, and even not on the dark streets of Gotham City. No, now he send us to the journey to, and perhaps beyond the boundaries of the possible and impossible, through the curvature of space and time, in other worlds. And you won't forget this trip, this can be assured. I was madly waiting for Interstellar's release. And then, finally, I was able to see this Beauty - at the premiere in my coutry on October, 29. It was incredibly exciting. It was a delight. It was unforgettable. It was gorgeous. Nolan once again amazes the viewer's imagination by his painting. Journey to the brink of infinity, the line where humanity has never set, acts as either the first-born purpose and a background of emotional history about the father and the daughter. A loving father who mankind need to help, but that he should leave his children, and a loving daughter who doesn't want to let her dad in the infinity darkness. Starting from the very first frame and ending with the closing credits, a new picture of Nolan will absorb you completely, forcing stare at the screen during the whole action, because it's all so exciting and interesting that escape becomes physically impossible. No, this three hours won't fly quickly for you. You'll feel every emotion, every event, every character. You will not look how the main characters travel through the universe, because the movie experience in this film is so excellent that you will be on board of ""Endurance"" starship and travel between the worlds with the main characters by yourself.The emotional core of this story is the relationship of Matthew McConaughey's character and his daughter - Mackenzie Foy' and Jessica Chastain' character. And the acting work of these three artists in ""Interstellar"" impress the most. McConaughey was acting really great, and this is one of the most emotional, if not the most emotional role of his life. All the drama and tragedy of the relationship of father and daughter in this film will not leave anyone indifferent. Anne Hathaway, Wes Bentley, Michael Caine, Casey Affleck, Ellen Burstyn and other actors also coped with their roles and presented the film's supporting characters very realistic. I would particularly like to note a small but important in this story role of Matt Damon, a character who has received quite memorable. If we talk about the characters, it should be noted also two robots that accompanied our heroes in this difficult journey. One of them adds a touch of humor in the film, which mitigates constantly depressing, dramatic, and sometimes really dark atmosphere.The script of the film is very well combined the history of space exploration and the relationship between Cooper and Murph. The story is complex and complicated, is based on real scientific theories by Kip Thorne, and indeed contains a reference to the ""Space Odyssey"" and other sci-fi pictures. This story about true love, about loyalty, forgiveness, fraud, hard decisions, and much more. And it is designed so that leaves a lot of room for the imagination of the viewer. It's also possible to notice some structure allusion to another Nolan's work - Inception. The story and visuals are combined just perfectly in Interstellar.Hans Zimmer's score, written by him on the basis of only one letter from Nolan, hold the key: ""Once we become parents, we can't help but look at ourselves through the eyes of our children"", deserves a special praise. On this basis, Hans managed to write just incredible soundtrack that perfectly harmonizes with the history and the visual side of the picture. And this work of the composer is really different from the previous ones. It is executed in a different style from another subject in its base. Very impressive work, which will be pleasantly listened again and separate from the film itself. Visual range of the picture is incredibly beautiful and circuses. The ""Endurance"" itself, new worlds, insanely beautiful and mysterious space, wormholes, black holes, and travel through them, folds of time and space are arranged so that is simply breathtaking. I would like to thank all those who contributed to the creation of a visual of this film. It must be seen. That mastery with which this is done, not just words. In the visual pattern also has some references to the Kubrick's ""Odyssey"", and they are pleasing to the eye.Many thanks to Christopher Nolan for having given us such an incredible movie, which once again proved to us that the cinema is Nolan's life. ""Interstellar"" is a film that wins the hearts of the audience not only with its sci-fi splendor, but also an emotional story that lies at its very heart. This film is not only about the discoveries, space exploration and the final frontier of mankind, but also about the relationship of father and daughter, who were in a difficult situation in life when one has to leave the other in the name of a goal that can not be underestimated. So, with what Nolan's genius unfolds before us this action is beyond praise. Combining the story, filled with not only real science fiction, but the true human values <U+200B><U+200B>and emotions, outstanding and very emotional performances, breathtaking visuals, epic and dramatic soundtrack, Christopher Nolan breathed the life into this film by his directing to create something truly masterpiece again.

"3287","Interstellar",9,"A familiar journey to the unknown, albeit a grand one","So last night I got the chance to see the early screening of Christopher Nolan's Interstellar. The film I've been waiting so much from the early days of the shooting. How did it fare? Here's my take:To avoid any tl;dr risk, let me get this straight from the very beginning, Interstellar is one goddamnedly good film, it gets you to the edge of your seat, it soars, it warps, it rips your brain senseless. It's that good.Interstellar is a story about the earth dying, with its soil no longer able to sustain crops other than corn, and of course, it will lead to the extinction of humanity. Our hero is an ex-NASA test pilot named Cooper (Matthew McConaughey), a typical ordinary-guy-in-an-extraordinary- situation everyman who's also a dedicated family man, especially toward his daughter Murphy (named after the Murphy's Law). In an all-too-Armageddon style our hero gets invited by the (publicly) defunct NASA to become humanity's last hope in finding a new home, for they have found a wormhole near Saturn (2001, anyone?) which will warp the astronauts to another galaxy in quest of a habitable planet. Solid and compact premise, although it's been used before.For seasoned filmgoers, there are many similar elements (although it's understandable) with Stanley Kubrick's 2001: A Space Odyssey (1968) and Robert Zemeckis' Contact (1997). In a sense that this is not a bang-bang-shoot-shoot-blow-em-up sci-fi, but more of a slow-burning, metaphysical sci-fi which gets you to think about your place in the universe and your exact place in time.Similarity with 2001 and Contact is never a bad thing, but it becomes a wee bit too predictable, although Nolan is a smart enough director in providing the final (a very sentimental one, I should say) twist in the story. The visuals in this film is majestic, everything is shot to a meticulously calculated level, Nolan-style. The space scenes are serenely suspenseful just like Cuaron's Gravity, but unlike the documentary feel of Gravity, there's a real gusto and pace to these scenes. You should also be prepared for the (for some, maybe) unexpected third act, it is Nolan's most sentimental and humane moment to date. And this is why Interstellar is more than just a science-fiction, it is a human drama intertwined in space and time loop.One thing that Nolan gets a bit wrong is the narrative. Nolan was never a 'warm' director, his films are filled with brilliant ideas and flair but it feels cold, it maybe suits Memento and The Dark Knight but in Interstellar he seems to have been lost in determining which of the interpersonal drama or the sci-fi that will be Interstellar's forte. The result is a rather incongruous script, intermittently cutting off the excitement of the previous scene and so on. But it is a forgivable sin, for the good is a lot more than the bad in this monumental film. At the end of the day, all I can say is that Interstellar is a grand film. It is monolithic, thoughtful, sentimental, sophisticated, visceral but also with its flaws. I wouldn't say it's Nolan's best work to date, but I daresay that this is one of the best science fiction ever released.After watching Interstellar, do yourself a favor and get lost in space and time and go back in time to see Contact (1997) and 2001: A Space Odyssey (1968) to further wonder and wander into the realms of the unknown.Because sometimes it is the unknown that fascinates us, frightens us and brings out the best in us."

The ones that inspire you to want to change your life after a mere two and a half hours.I watched this movie the first time over a month and a half ago and it still crops up in my mind. The thought of space travel excites me along with countless others and this movie has literally made me rethink my life choices and pushed me into wanting to become an astronaut. As childish as it sounds, its true, because its one of those movies. Interstellar has become my new favourite movie by far.Bravo Nolan what a great human bean"
"3289","Interstellar",10,"Epic in every way!","Just watched Interstellar in imax 70mm. Science Fiction fans can read on, everyone else can skip. Movie is a visual masterpiece. Like his earlier movies, Christopher Nolan once again proved, how big a movie can be! There were some shots,which made audience go crazy..Some scenes were as epic as 2001: A Space Odyssey. Do not go into the theatre expecting an action packed cerebral thriller. This one is not for action fans. At times, movie go highly sentimental( Matthew McConaughey does what he is best in and supposed to). I recommend this movie to all the Sci-Fi fans out there, make sure you go in group of sci-fi nuts!! Do not go with the hype..Go, sit back and enjoy. Just like Inception, this movie will be known as great after few months(I know people who said Inception was a crap when it released, and after few months rating it 10/10 in IMDb :D). I don't wanna spoil anything(If you want PM me). Also, make sure you go to the best theatre close to you. (If you loved Donnie Darko, 2001: A Space Odyssey, this is the one for you, Get ready to get mind blown!!) Interstellar Movie is EPIC in all sense!!"
"3290","Interstellar",10,"Going brilliantly (but very LOUDLY) into the dark","Wowser! This Christopher Nolan film was presaged with such marketing hype that I went in with pretty low and cynical expectations. But I was frankly blown away with it.Just about everyone raves about Christopher Nolan's work, and you look back at his Filmography and it makes for a pretty impressive resume: from Memento via the (rather over-hyped imho) Dark Knight Batman series-reboot through to Inception, one of my favourite films of all time. For me, Interstellar is right up there with Inception for thought-provoking, visually spectacular and truly epic cinema.We start in familiar 'Day after Tomorrow"" territory, with mankind having in some way  not entirely explained  messed up the planet. As I understood it (and the film probably does require multiple watches with  see comments below  subtitles=on) the rather clever premise is that the world's food supplies are being progressively destroyed by a vindictive 'blight'. This delivers the double whammy of destroying mankind's provisions but also, by massive reproduction of the organism, progressively depleting the Earth's oxygen. For some reason  again, which I didn't get on first viewing  this is accompanied by massive dust storms. It is a morbid bet as to what is going to get the mid-West population first: starvation, lung disease or suffocation. Matthew McConnaughey plays the widowed Cooper, an ex-NASA drop out turned farmer given the opportunity by mission-leader Professor Brand (an excellent Michael Caine) to pilot a NASA mission. The goal is to punch through a mysterious wormhole in space where they suspect, through previous work, that a new home for mankind could be found.The first part of the film is set on and around Cooper's farm, setting in place one of the emotional wrenches at the heart of the film: that Cooper in volunteering for the mission and having to leave behind his elderly father (John Lithgow, again superb) and young children Murph (aged 10) and Tom (aged 15) whilst recognising that danger for him comes not just from the inherent risks involved but from the theory of relativity that could change everything, time-wise, for when he returns.Cooper is supported on the mission by a team of scientists including Brand's daughter played by a love-struck Anne Hathaway, who again shows she can act.To say any more would spoil what is a voyage of visual and mental discovery. (However, I would add that it is good to see that the character that plays my namesake Dr Mann (in a surprise cameo) is equally good looking! LOL).In terms of plus points, where do I start? The visuals are utterly stunning. Whilst reminiscent in places of Kubrick's ""stargate"" from 2001, the similarity is only passing. The film adds a majesty and scale to space that surpasses wonder. Elsewhere there are some interesting visual effects: this might have just been me of course, but after the dramatic launch there was something about the camera moves during the first scenes of weightlessness that made me feel genuinely nauseous.Equally stunning is Hans Zimmer's score which is epic and (in places) very VERY loud. The film certainly doesn't ""go quietly into the night""! When matching the noise of the score/choir to the sound effects in the launch sequence the combination is ear-bleedingly effective. This must be a strong contender for the soundtrack Oscar for 2014. One quibble, again 2001 related, is that Zimmer uses the last chord of Also Sprach Zarathustra in the score sufficiently often that one hopes Richard Strauss's estate receives some royalties! The acting is top notch: I've already mentioned Caine and Lithgow, but McConnaughey, Hathaway and Jessica Chastain are all great. A particular shout-out should go to Mackenzie Foy as the young Murph, who is magnetically charismatic and just brilliant in the role.Above all, Nolan's direction is exquisite. The film has a slow build on earth (which adds to the lengthy running time) but defines the characters and primes the plot perfectly. And some of the editing cuts  again, Cooper's farm departure/launch sequence overlay is a great example  are superb in building the mood and the tension.I've decided that I am an extremely tough reviewer and for me a 10 star film is a rarity indeed. Where I could have knocked off a star was in some of the dialogue on the soundtrack, which was pretty inaudible in places: McConnaughey in particular with his general mumbling and strong southern accent is indecipherable in places. I look forward to the DVD subtitles. And one of the character's dying words  delivering a key plot point in the film  was completely lost to me (but thankfully later restated). Whilst the expansive plot is highly ambitious, the end of the film, playing fast and loose with physics I fear, requires a gravity-defying suspension of belief (although I guess the same could equally be said of 2001: A Space Odyssey).However, the film has stayed so firmly lodged in my mind for 24 hours I will make a rare exception to my rating 'rule'. Overall, this is a top-notch Sci-Fi film. And a final word: PEOPLE<U+0085> THIS IS A MUST SEE ON THE BIG SCREEN!

"3291","Interstellar",10,"Great","One of the best movies i have ever seen in my life!"
"3292","Interstellar",10,"The GENIUS shocks the world by another unique innovation..!!","(((WOW)))...!!!It's almost impossible to put in words, but we have to try and give everyone what he truly deserve.In my modest opinion, Interstellar is the best Sci-Fi in human history. Believe it or not. It's the simple and the complicated, It's the usual and the different, It's the mind and the heart, It's an emotional and psychological journey through the unknown which has its own stunning visuals. It's an original story and thought-provoking masterpiece.Every single time with him, you just got crazy about his ideas, astonished by his mind games and inspired when he talks to the heart.Back then, he was an ambitious young director. And with his capabilities made his own way straight through the world. Now, he is an icon and a legend of directing. He is Christopher Nolan...Really guys, what's wrong with this guy ?!! what's going on inside his head ?!!It's our job to honor the honorable. Please, Just keep the rating UP, why ? Because Chris. and Interstellar deserve it."
"3293","Interstellar",10,"You will love it or hate it","OK, I've just seen Interstellar and I can tell it's one of those movies that you either love or hate.Personally I loved it and probably I'm going to watch it again to process it a little bit more. It's not a simple movie, maybe that was already clear, is a Nolan's film.Matthew McConaughey does a great job by portraying Cooper. The most touching scenes are those between his character and Mackenzie Foy, who plays the younger version of Murph, Jessica Chastain character. Either it seems to be an ""Outer Space Film"" is more about human relations and how important is for us to be linked with others. Even it's a long movie, 169 minutes, I didn't felt it that long or tedious. The director managed to keep us engaged through the whole film. The experience on IMAX in 70mm film. The image quality perceived was superb, now I get why Christopher Nolan and other directors are fighting to keep film alive. I had the opportunity to watch it at the Chinese theatre and was a great experience, my first time in that theatre. The staff from the theatre even told us that Nolan himself watched several scenes of the movie in that theatre to ""calibrate"" the experience. Which is very cool. Well, I encourage you to go and watch Interstellar to see of you love or hate it."
"3294","Interstellar",10,"I literally said to myself: this is a perfect film","During the emergency docking scene, I said to myself: ""this movie is perfect"". I couldn't fund a flaw. The story is enthralling and you feel the anxiety of the people who are struggling to survive and help others to do the same thing. There is a gravity to their work and they each show it well.My favorite genre us sci fi. This is plausible scifi, which is my favorite subset of scifi. McConnahey is amazing as usual. The young actress who plays his daughter seems like a break out star who we will def see again.The music is so good I'm learning a guitar transcription of some of the songs on the finger style guitar we site.I've seen Interstellar 7 or 8 times. I'll watch it regularly for years to come. It's a classic of our time much like Inglorious Basterds."
"3295","Interstellar",10,"Not Just A Class Apart...One of the Best 'Sci-Fi' flicks of all time!","Bad-ass... is the adjective which I choose to type the first word of this review. As I left the theater I was not only spellbound, but I was also sulking about the fact that the movie had ended.The movie has a slow pace at the beginning, but not really boring. Steady and unique in its nature, I did feel that this movie might end up like last years blockbuster 'Gravity' starring Sandra Bullock and George Clooney. With every minute that passed, I could feel the importance of time, which let my prejudice drain away. With twists and turns, but not brain-spraining at all, it did make emotions come at par with adventure.Great acting by Matthew McConaughey did overshadow Anne Hathaway. With an epic storyline and Nolan's direction Space, Galaxy and the Universe did reach a whole new level.I would love to rate this movie 10 stars without a second thought because it reached the depth of my heart and left me speechless. This movie is not a movie which is meant to be wasted by watching it at your laptop or TV. It's buck worthy and a must watch for all the people who wait for some new serious, touching, heartwarming, adventurous, Science Fiction and Oscar deserving movies of all time. Hat's off to both the Nolans!"
"3296","Interstellar",10,"One viewing may not suffice","I saw this opening night (Thursday). I wanted the full monty. That means IMAX (I drove across town to get it). Wow! There are only a handful of films that have visually overwhelmed me and required a second go (or more). The first was 2001 A Space Odyssey. Star Wars Empire Strikes Back and Avatar come to mind for now. This was such a spectacle with a very complex script I'll admit I left the theater with a lot of questions. I knew it was a viscerally thrilling experience, I just couldn't fully explain the ending to my inquiring mind. I write this piece having seen this amazing film again four days later (No IMAX). OMG! I loved this movie even more tonight than four days ago. For me at least, it took two viewings for the grandeur of this project to reveal its power and intellectual reach. This is a science fiction film for the ages!"
"3297","Inception",10,"Insanely Brilliant ! Nolan has outdone himself !!","What is the most resilient parasite? An Idea! Yes, Nolan has created something with his unbelievably, incredibly and god- gifted mind which will blow the minds of the audience away. The world premiere of the movie, directed by Hollywood's most inventive dreamers, was shown in London and has already got top notch reviews worldwide and has scored maximum points! Now the question arises what the movie has that it deserve all this?Dom Cobb(Di Caprio) is an extractor who is paid to invade the dreams of various business tycoons and steal their top secret ideas. Cobb robs forcefully the psyche with practiced skill, though he's increasingly haunted by the memory of his late wife, Mal (Marion Cotillard), who has a nasty habit of showing up in his subconscious and wreaking havoc on his missions. Cobb had been involved so much in his heist work that he had lost his love!But then, as fate had decided, a wealthy business man Saito( Ken Watanabe) hands over the responsibility of dissolving the empire of his business rival Robert Fischer Jr.(Cillian Murphy). But this time his job was not to steal the idea but to plant a new one: 'Inception'Then what happens is the classic heist movie tradition. To carry out the the task, Cobb's 'brainiac' specialists team up again with him, Arthur (Joseph Gordon-Levitt), his longtime organizer; Tom Hardy (Eames), a ""forger"" who can shapeshift at will; and Yusuf (Dileep Rao), a powerful sedative supplier. There is only one word to describe the cinematography, the set designs and the special effects, and that is Exceptional! You don't just watch the scenes happening, you feel them. The movie is a real thrill ride. The action scenes are well picturised and the music by Hans Zimmer is electronically haunting. Never, in the runtime of the movie, you will get a chance to move your eyes from the screen to any other object.Leonardo, who is still popularly known for Jack Dawson played by him in Titanic, should be relieved as his role as Dom Cobb will be remembered forever. His performance may or may not fetch him an Oscar but it will be his finest performance till date. The supporting cast too did an extraordinary work. Christopher Nolan, ah! what a man he is. His work is nothing less than a masterpiece and he deserves all the awards in the 'Best Director' category. If ""Inception"" is a metaphysical puzzle, it's also a metaphorical one: It's hard not to draw connections between Cobb's dream-weaving and Nolan's film making, intended to seduce us, mess with our heads and leave an ever-lasting impression.To conclude, I would just say before your life ends, do yourself a favor by experiencing this exceptionally lucid classic created by Nolan! My Rating: 10/10Thanks & Regards"
"3298","Inception",10,"Incredible-Nolan keeps improving and Inception is by far the best improvement!","I saw Memento very recently, something that turned out to be a great miss.I saw it again, just to make a couple of thins straight-and i'll definitely do the same with Inception.Christopher Nolan keeps improving himself, with even more complex and multilayer script like this.And i thought Memento was hard to reach by most of the viewers, but no.Inception will keep you mesmerized and captivated by the genius, that's hidden behind it.And not just directors and screenwriters (or with other words-Nolan), but with acting and sound-and effects and editing as well.When you have a cast like this-i mean Leonardo DiCaprio, Joseph Gordon-Lewitt, Michael Caine, or Marion Cotillard (a personal favourite), the movie just keeps going flawlessly.Most of the crew is the same the Nolan brothers worked with on TDK and earlier in Batman Begins.So the Oscar noms in those categories are a certainty for me.The only thing one could have against the movie, is the headache one could have.See, most of my friends go to the movies for brainless action, they enjoyed Iron Man 2 and The A-Team, but this movie-you have to see it at least twice, to understand it.The levels and the layers on which thing are happening are so many, that one surely'll miss something vital.This is a reason for not fitting to the mass audience, but i hope that won't happen, because Nolan is one of my favourite directors/writers, and he showed, that the brainless action flicks aren't all of it.There are still movies like Inception out there and still people like the Nolans to make those movies, so it's not all lost.And i hope this movie could show the audience that the story is still important for the experience one could receive, not the endless, constant explosions.Because this is really a one of a lifetime event.Saying that, i must say, that in a world full of remakes, reboots, sequels, prequels and God knows what, this is a unique chance to see something different and unmatched so far-a strong movie, that, surely will be Nolan's latest masterpiece! My Grade won't change-it's the same for all Nolan movies-sheer 10!"
"3299","Inception",10,"Nolan at his most intelligent best.","Inception is truly one of a kind. A concept which has long gestated in Christopher Nolan's mind, his eye for drama mixed with his large scale sensibilities ring true in Blockbuster season making Inception a true original in the sea of reboots, remakes and sequels.To try and explain Inceptions many plot twists and incredibly intelligent arcs, would be a foolish task. As Nolan himself has been reluctant to. The best way to approach the film would be with an open mind, if you are prepared to be taken on a ride of a lifetime, then trust that you 100% will. If Avatar was a seminal film in technology (although coming out as a rather poor film, in my opinion), then Inception is seminal in it's storytelling. With a 148 minute running time, you would expect a lot to take place, but what you wouldn't expect is the pace of it all. I did not think at one time in the film about how long was left. I was simply blown away by the depth in every single part of the film. If my enthusiasm for the storytelling aspect of the film has left you worried about the spectacle, then don't worry. They are, as hinted in the trailer, incredible, looking real and unbelievable simultaneously. The most pleasing thing about the action set pieces, is that they are genuinely used to illustrate the story, rather than to blow stuff up a la Michael Bay.With this complex movie in it's high concept, a stellar cast is needed. And Nolan as always, delivers with just that. This is vintage DiCaprio, perhaps only equalled in The Aviator, which is even more impressive as his role as Cobb in Inception is not a showy one, needing DiCaprio to be the constant at the centre of the film. And he pulls off Cobb's emotional contradictions sublimely. The rest of the cast members all shine in parts of the films, Cillian Murphy shows off his usually non-existent tender side, Gordon-Levitt bottles his usual charm for his confidently reserved turn as the reliable Arthur, Watanabe is devilish as the seemingly ambiguous Saito, Page shows why she's the next big female star and Tom Hardy revels in being the comic relief of the film compared to his recent turns as decidedly psychopathic characters.Overall, Nolan has indeed surpassed himself. He has created a world as expansive as his Gotham, a plot dwarfing the intricacies of Memento and one which blows The Prestige's cinematic reveal out of the water. This is truly unmissable cinema. Revel in it, we've still got to wait a whole two years before Batman 3."
"3300","Inception",10,"Amazing Directing, Captivating Plot, Overall Great","I had the privilege of seeing this movie before it came out, and, like most of DiCaprio's films, it blew me away.Inception is a well-made movie, filmed in about 6 locations all over the world. The directing was outstanding, there were only about two moments, maybe three seconds in total, where i noticed that visual effects were being used (of course defying gravity is pretty difficult). The plot was very pleasingly intricate, with a twist-and-turn, keep-you-on-the-edge-of-your-seat type feel. I noticed that this film had similarities with DiCaprios thriller Shutter Island (which i also enjoyed very much)seeing as it left you wondering what was real and what was not. It's great to see a movie with a thick and emotional plot and not just grenade-throwing action heroes who achieve greatness in the end.Inception also has a very well-composed score, which to me was the finishing touch to a perfect movie. If you're thinking about seeing Inception, definitely go! Even though i was fortunate enough to see a free show, it is worth every penny you pay. Truly unique, like nothing i've ever seen before. Christopher Nolan certainly covered new ground with this film and wasn't afraid to leave us hanging with a spectacular ending."
"3301","Inception",10,"Nolan's first true masterpiece","Usually I try to be careful with over hyping a film, or setting the expectations too high, as film geeks all are guilty for, however for Christopher Nolan's Inception, this really is not possible.This is possibly one of the only perfect films I have ever seen. It is absolutely confident in every way, something which is extremely refreshing, even more so than Avatar. Christopher Nolan gets some slack for making great to look at but ultimately heartless affairs, which I for one do not agree with, however I do not think anyone can argue that here. The emotional aspect of this film not only ties it all together but is really the centre of this film, it is the focus. I do not want to over simplify the film, by simply calling it Kubrick doing Bond, or Gondry on a huge budget, because I am sure it will be called that but it is far more than that, it is something I do not think Kubrick could have ever made. It is pure Nolan, and pure greatness.I hate writing something which is pure fan-boy gushing, but its really difficult here. I did not find a thing I did not like about it, I am sure if maybe I saw it a second time, maybe I would find something about it I didn't like, but not the first time. The way it is cut, means that there is always action on screen, if not, then the visuals are interesting enough to keep your eyes glued.The final hour of the film, is possibly one of the most complicated action sequences put on film. You have to constantly be paying attention to remember all of the layers of what is happening. Without spoiling anything, all I have to say is that is what this film is about, that is what makes this film so great, layers. Once you have seen this you will now what I am talking about.All of the actors are fantastic too, Di Caprio is the stand out here. Yes, this is probably due to the fact he is the star and given all of the emotional weight, but he handles it perfectly, similarly to his performance in Shutter Island. Ellen Page, whom I usually hate, gives a great performance here. Tom Hardy gives a break out performance here, he is quite the bad ass.I hope audiences are ready for a film like this, a pure auteur driven film which does not sacrifice a single frame for the studio. I would hope this film will change Hollywood, as it is 100 percent the directors vision yet it is definitely a marketable film, much like District 9, yet I do not think it will. I cannot recommend this film anymore than I have, I just have to say everyone and anyone should see it. Sorry about all the gushing, it is just so hard not too.If you liked this review check out my new film blog: http://thedeletedscene.wordpress.com"
"3302","Inception",8,"Sci-fi perfection. A truly mesmerizing film.","I'm nearly at a loss for words. Just when you thought Christopher Nolan couldn't follow up to ""The Dark Knight"", he does it again, delivering another masterpiece, one with so much power and rich themes that has been lost from the box office for several years. Questioning illusions vs reality usually makes the film weird, but Nolan grips your attention like an iron claw that you just can't help watching and wondering what will happen next. That is a real powerful skill a director has. No wonder Warner Bros. put their trust in him, he is THAT good of a director, and over-hyping a Christopher Nolan film, no matter what the film is about, is always an understatement instead of an overestimate like MANY films before.Not since the eras of Stanley Kubrick, Andrei Tarkovsky and Alfred Hitchcock has there been a more brilliant director than Christopher Nolan. He is, undoubtedly, one of THE most brilliant and gifted Hollywood filmmakers in history. Filmmakers like him come but just once in a lifetime. He has the ability to seduce our eyes, ears and most importantly, mind, and then delivers what he intends to deliver in full blast. Rarely have blockbusters have the gall to deliver such amounts imagination and intelligence at the same time. And yes, it is similar to the excellent anime film ""Paprika"" in the whole ""invading dreams"" plot, but the similarities end there as Nolan brings the film to a whole different level.Visuals and intelligence rarely come together in movies at the same time, it's either all-visuals-no-smarts (""G.I. Joe"", ""Transformers"") or the exact opposite (""Doubt"", ""Invictus""). In this film the excellently directed action sequences combined with immensely groundbreaking and jaw-dropping visual effects are combined smoothly with a heavy dose of intelligence and believability.Although having an ensemble cast and financed by a Hollywood giant studio (Warner Bros), this film is a very personal film for Nolan, he wrote the film as well as directing it, and as you watch the film you get many glimpses of Nolan's perplexing, increasingly imaginative thoughts and dreams in the dialog that he writes and the plot that he sets up. Ideas have never felt more interesting and put to good use than in this film. This film is NOT for the popcorn muncher, rather it is a film for thinkers. Honestly I can't explain the plot for fear of spoiling the movie for you readers. Even the slightest hint will ruin the experience. The viewer will walk out of the cinema feeling dazed, confused and ultimately breathless. It's like a puzzle, both physically and mentally, and you have to pay attention throughout the film for the clues. However Nolan controls the spectacle of the film and is careful not to let it overwhelm the film's humanity, and this is where ""Inception"" shines. It is a very deep film that will have one thinking and asking questions for years to come. That's right, years.Once the film ends, you'll want to watch it again, for there's something new every time. This is a film that requires multiple viewing for someone to truly comprehend the film's ambiguous themes, and will be discussed by many in the future. This is an original film, no adaptation, no sequel/prequel, no remake/reboot, which is extremely refreshing having gone nearly three years of mostly unremarkable visual effects roadshows (""Avatar"" be damned).Of course, a film is not complete without the actors. Leo DiCaprio delivers an Oscar worthy performance, similar but better than his previous effort ""Shutter Island"". He shows glimpses of a flawed, grim, fragile man, who has knowledge about everything else but yet can't seem to come in grips with himself and his demons. Joseph Gordon-Levitt, Ellen Page, Tom Hardy, Ken Watanabe, Dileep Rao, Cillian Murphy, Tom Berenger, Michael Caine, Marion Cottilard, Pete Postlethwaite, Lukas Haas... Nolan really brings out the best in this unusual yet extremely talented group of supporting actors who make their roles their own.Nolan is of course, a master behind the camera, a real virtuoso when it comes to film. His direction is taut, focused, gripping, and extraordinarily fascinating. The detailed and complex original script is no surprise from Nolan, considering the fact that he turned Batman the superhero into pop-culture art two years ago (""The Dark Knight""). The action sequences are unique, exciting and fresh, something absent from the cinema which has since been interested at things popping towards the screen and stuff blowing up every two milliseconds. The visual effects are awesome and imaginative, and best of all they do not bring down the movie's quality one bit, rather it makes the movie more fascinating to watch. The cinematography is absolutely, beautifully shot, so we can see the action and emotion in all their glory. Production design is top notch, with terrific design of sets and locations. Hans Zimmer's complementing music score is simply outstanding, and knowing the man, that's really all I have to say. Together all of these elements combine to deliver a mesmerizing movie experience like no other this year.Christopher Nolan has once again outdone himself. He truly is a gifted filmmaker, arguably the most imaginative in Hollywood today. And ""Inception"" can proudly stand alongside ""Blade Runner"" and ""2001: A Space Odyssey"" as science-fiction masterpieces that push the boundaries for movie making and become a different experience altogether.There are two types of films: the crowd-pleasing blockbuster and the intelligent indie/art film. Nolan has combined two of these tropes together into one exceptionally brilliant package, pulling off that rare, now nearly-extinct Movie Magic that has since been wiped off the planet by sequelitis and reboots. Movie of Summer 2010? Movie of 2010? Heck this is possibly the first masterpiece of the decade! Nolan is a genius and I applaud him for treating his audiences as intelligent people.Missing this film and not getting the film's point is a crime.Overall value: 9/10 (Excellent)"
"3303","Inception",9,"A Potpourri of Vestiges Review: Buñuel meets Kubrick in Nolan's most ambitious venture, till date","Surrealism can appear to be ineffably bizarre, or inquisitively titillating, depending purely on the viewer's intellect. Though the realm of surrealism is highly nebulous and complex, but even a slight attempt at improvisation can sometimes go awry and open a Pandora's Box, making the task highly improbable and nigh impossible. This facet of reality may pose a handicap to the most gifted of the directors, but not to the genius of Christopher Nolan, who not only dabbles with the concept of surrealism, but also ingeniously blends it with the elements of Science Fiction in his latest wonder named Inception. Nolan created a niche for himself a decade back by unleashing a monster of a movie called Memento. He further substantiated his status by conjuring movies like Insomnia, The Prestige, Batman Begins, and The Dark Knight. His unremitting desire for innovation and uncanny craving to foray into the unexplored realms of imagination deservedly earned him an auteur tag, which gave him the carte blanche that a story-teller like Nolan desperately needs. It's highly apparent that Nolan takes every possible advantage of this liberty while filming Inception. Inception is not only dreamlike, but is a dream in itself and is superior to any other thing conceived on the silver screen. With its entwined layers, the movie for the most part serves as an unfathomable riddle and makes multiple viewing extremely essential. It incredibly does extremely well on both the humanistic as well as the technical fronts. In fact, the balance between human emotions and the elements of Science Fiction is so adequate that it's impossible to separate them. The movie is about a futuristic world where the human mind can be intercepted through dream invasion. Cobb is an expert in the art of extracting information (stealing valuable secrets) from deep within the subconscious in the dream state. His proficiency in extraction is marred by a turmoil that begins with his wife's untimely death. He is forced to live the life of a fugitive away from his children. His only chance for redemption lies with a Japanese tycoon named Saitu, who wants him to do an inception (planting information into someone's mind). In order to accomplish this unprecedented task, Cobb and his team must overcome a labyrinth of unforeseeable challenges, where even a slight miss could trap them in a perpetual limbo. Any further revelation would be remissness on my part as the plot is filled with such intricacies that even expatiation would be incapable of justifying its profundity. Leonardo Dicaprio gives a solid performance in the lead role, following his memorable performance in Shutter Island. He has brilliantly depicted the complexities and limitations of Cobb's enigmatic character highlighting his pain and mental trauma. Marion Cotillard is ravishingly scintillating as Cobb's whimsical wife, Mal. The rest of the cast has given a thorough performance with special mention of Ken Watanabe, Ellen Page and Joseph Gordon-Levitt.Inception is incredibly brilliant as a movie and is a breakthrough in contemporary cinema. Nolan's creativity and his unparalleled execution definitely make it an object of great cachet, but whether it would become Buñuel's 'Un chien andalou' or Kubrick's '2001: A Space Odyssey' and serve as a prototype for the movies to come is for the time to decide. Irrespectively, Inception is sine qua non not only for an aficionado, but also for the average viewer, who is willing to delve deep enough to savour the delight.PS: One has to imagine it to believe it. 9/10http://www.apotpourriofvestiges.com/"
"3304","Inception",9,"A tool of hope.","Have you ever felt like waking up from a dream to see its continuation? This idea disturbs Christopher Nolan ever since he was 16. Already in the future, as he developed this idea in his head, he was visited by another captivating feeling. And what if it were possible to study and manage the place of sleep? Now the British cinematographer is 39 years old, and the world has finally come to the opportunity to get to know what Nolan was so stunning, fast and loud all these years. ""The Beginning"" is a sci-fi thriller about the architecture of the mind. If for some reason this has not yet become a reason for the strongest intrigue, it is never too late to recreate it.Philosophy of Nolan. It is simple and at the same time terrifyingly exceptional. Making your environment think like you. To share all the events happening together. Experiencing the same difficulties. Strive to hold together for the hands to achieve the impossible. Making unusual things happen in the usual way. The topic can be continued, and its brief description will remain unchanged. Any person with whom you work, whether an actor or someone else, will always be completely imbued with the material that you yourself wrote, if this material is perceived by every person at the deepest personal level.Fans of the series ""LOST"" could have done the same thing with ""Star"" as they did with every series of the popular, now in the old days, series. Probably, for a reason, at the end of the day, a percentage of people will be drawn, what from wild ecstasy after watching will obviously lose consciousness in the most positive sense? The name of the film company Nolan ""Syncopy"" from the ancient Greek era means the medical term of fainting, loss of consciousness. I'm not talking about plot similarities with the term. And the logo of his film company, whose foundation happened in the year 99, has absolutely identical design as the ""Start"" screensaver. In the picture, the characters Paige and DiCaprio get acquainted in the same place where Nolan once met his future wife and constant working partner. And this is not all ""Easter eggs"".
From the skyscrapers of Tokyo to the snowy peaks of Calgary, from the exoticism of the Moroccan Tangier to the picturesque streets of Paris, from historic London to modern-day Los Angeles. The scale that Nolan saw from the emotional journey of his painting could not fit in a modest framework, so the shooting process affected 4 continents and 6 so different countries.To make the dreams look as real as possible, the director once again followed his eternal principle and tried to maximally abandon computer graphics. Whether it's a revolving corridor 30 meters long built in Cardington, or the busiest street in Paris, mass explosions are caused by nothing else than nitrogen under high pressure. Impressive buildings in the Canadian Calgary provided work for thousands of local residents for six months. Their efforts could not justify themselves fully due to the fact that on approaching the crew to the place of direct filming, for a long time there was not much needed snow. He ""fell out"", creating for the creators is another problem due to the fact that did not stop a very long period. Arriving in early August in Morocco, a big unexpected success for the creators was the acquaintance with the local team, with whose help Hollywood partially took off more than one blockbuster in the territory of this African country. And the street traffic of Los Angeles was cleaned by the railroad train, behind the wheel of which was everyone's favorite Jim Wilkie. The same guy who ran an eighteen wheeled wagon in the ""Dark Knight"". This is only a small part of what the ""Beginning"" shakes.DiCaprio amazes us with one of the most difficult characters of recent times, which is largely due to the care and personal affection that Leo showed to Cobb. Together with Marion Cotillard, they create a screen couple capable of enveloping the soul of any viewer. I've never seen anything like it and close. The talented Hollywood youth in the faces of Page and Gordon-Levitt demonstrate a full understanding of the color range and levels of brightness of the characters assigned to them. Tom Hardy, performing the imitator, brought to the picture a significant share of charisma. And Killian Murphy finally embodied an image that has long been very curious to him. In May 2009, Nolan offered him absolutely any role, and he chose the ""Client"". And Ken Watanabe ... As in the case with the other images, we all will long try to disassemble this character, which is a very important and charismatic question for us. Each of his actors, Nolan asked not to tell anything about the plot, even to their families.Quite symbolic is the fact of the presence in the film of the song of Edith Piaf. After all, for the image of Edith Piaf in the film ""Life in pink"" in 2007, Marion Cotillard received a statuette of Oscar for Best Actress. Hans Zimmer paid close attention to the creation of the track, not so much to the stunning visual component of the picture, but to the emotional world of the main characters. It's always evident when Hans is captured by the storyline of the picture for which he is going to work, and ""Beginning"" is no exception. Filling the rich sensory undercurrent on the screen with a wonderful musical series, Hans did not leave behind his own imagination, allowing himself to go beyond the usual framework in the hope of looking where they would lead him. From here came the guitar, played on which none other than Johnny Marr of the band ""The Smiths"".
For any of us, there is a difference in choice, when deciding whether it is worth chasing us for a happy moment or total happiness as such? Also here. Despite the speed with which you develop on the screen a completely different action - you want to keep up with it. Our feelings are awakened in the most active ways because of the resource that causes in us a similar instinct to comprehension and further awareness. This tape is a symbol of the whole structure of our everyday perception of what surrounds us in the material and immaterial world. A symbol that is itself the architect of a bridge connecting two opposite sides.Incredible and colossal, difficult-procedural result of the most outstanding artistic production in all spheres of film production. A movie that will never leave your mind, demanding from you its regular revision. The movie, which you will discover with each new show for yourself in a new way. A mad, multi-level, impressive plot production, attached to the deepest actor images. Infinitely rich semantic context and visual component. All this is a combination of the greatest cinematic experience that Nolan dragged through all these years. He would never have become a director of N1 in the modern world if he were not true, loving his family by a man. And this is the most important thing. That - with what all ""Begins"" ...A rare dream that survived so many years ...Film of the Decade."

"3306","Inception",6,"Not bad, but definitely not genius","Inception is one of those movies that ""engaged"" film-goers will mistake for genius. Let me explain my theory on people and movies. There are three types of movie-watchers: passive, engaged, and intelligently engaged. Passive people will watch Die Another Day and like it just as much as the Bourne Identity. They don't go to the movies to think, they go to be entertained by cool effects and witty one-liners. Engaged people think they know what they're talking about, and generally love movies that are edgy in plot and execution but conventional enough to understand, like Fight Club and the subject of this review. They believe themselves to be refined in cinema, but, in reality, just don't quite have the intellect, cinematically speaking, to pull it off. Intelligently engaged people will appreciate the complexity of Inception, but also recognize it's a little sloppy, self-serious, over drawn, and empty. They recognize its audacity, but don't pretend like it is Kubrick or Paul Thomas Anderson. Suffice it to say, most people who fall into the engaged category will try and pretend that Inception is a 'masterpiece' and that they know everything about movies. They don't. Inception is clever, but it doesn't rank anything above respectable.The premise is ingenious, and Inception is able to live off its sheer mind-bendiness for the first 45 minutes. Leo is a specialist at entering people's minds through their dreams and extracting, or in this case, planting information. The dream world Nolan creates is so exciting and unpredictable that the audience, me included, couldn't care less about the actual story line. Unfortunately, when the magic wears off and the extravagantly overlong climax starts (almost at the midway point), things fall apart.The first problem is the eventual goal of the whole operation is seriously anti-climactic. As far as I could tell, they're trying to break up some obscure monopolistic multi-national company for a rich CEO, who in turn will give them large sums of money and Leo a way back to his kids. Sound under-developed? It is. Nolan never really fleshes it out. He is too busy creating spectacularly slick effects to get caught up in silly things like crucial plot points.When Inception hits its final profligate culmination (the climax inside the climax), I couldn't help but notice how empty it all was. Nolan makes the mistake of thinking multiple things happening at once equals suspense. In an effort to ratchet up the intensity, Nolan piles on at least 5 simultaneous plot-lines that climax at the same time. All this serves to do is suffocate the little suspense that had been built up. There is literally a fifteen minute stretch where Hans Zimmer's deafening score blares and Nolan annoyingly flips through the parallel actions like an ADD-afflicted friend who can't decide what channel to watch. It's mind- numbing, not to mention confusing as hell. One of these little subplots is particularly ridiculous and consists of a guy running around a snowbound bunker shooting people for the whole 15 minutes. Cutting-edge techno thriller? At this point, I was thinking more along the lines of a Roger Moore Bond flick.For all its structural faults, the single most damning aspect of Inception is its complete lack of heart or emotion. The one remotely human thread in the film deals with Leo and his mysterious dead wife. This thread is drawn out to excess and becomes more and more incomprehensible as the movie progresses. Inception seems to delight in keeping the audience in the dark regarding if Leo's wife is real or just a projection of his subconscious. Inception thinks it's awfully clever, but it's hard to feel emotion towards characters that you're not even sure exist. Near the end, I found the dialog between the unhappy couple completely devoid of meaning, made worse by Nolan attempting to give it resonance through close ups of people crying and a climaxing score. Despite the fact that the majority of this review deals with Inception's shortcomings, I actually like the movie as a whole. For all of its faults, I was grudgingly won over through Inception's pure style and visceral power. Nolan occasionally strikes brilliance, especially in an early scene where a dream explodes around Ellen and Leo in slow-motion virtuosity. This movie is not the genius many will claim, but it's not so bad either. Give it a shot, just don't expect to dream about it afterwards."
"3307","Inception",4,"Perception","You have this basic idea and the story, they are very good. And boy did the have money. And the CGI is spectacular, yes.Further on this:Inception is constantly VERBALLY explaining what is happening, why it is happening, how it's relating to things explained earlier and so on. The rules, the plot, the inner conflicts. Even at the 2/3rd of the movie, they are still explaining basic rules. I don't see why this was necessary as most of it is repetition. You get the same stuff over and over again, supposed you didn't get it for the first time. And again: VERBALLY. Exactly like in your average, random Venezuelan soap opera.Inception does almost not have any scenes. As far as I'm concerned, movies are about scenes. Here, you'll only be able to remember certain sequences, because it's all just one big a montage of sequences. It's the montage of the master-plan from Oceans 11 for 150 minutes and it's exaggerating.The score is non-stop blaring, all the darn time, even when people are just talking to each other, music is building up constantly to give you the perception, that there are serious things going on. It's just annoying, painful for the ears and pointless. Generally important scenes are in no contrast to basic scenes. It's one big video clip.Characters. I don't remember a single name, as there is no kind of character development going on here. It's just some well dressed people. All the dialog is used up, for basic explaining like ""for dummies"", rather then building character, relationships, or just being generally cool dialog. Occasional tries sounds like tag-lines or slogans while being just plain unintelligent. Also, this is leaving the actors no space to - well - act... which is a waste of the great cast.Now all these things are very amateur scriptwriting mistakes, or if you prefer: it's a stupid movie. But no one seems to notice as Nolan does everything to convince you that you are watching something meaningful.The blaring music and the hectic editing, the fact that there are permanently 3 scenes of action cut together into one sequence underlined by an incredibly severe score, it's just there to distract. Because in fact the movie has nothing new to show us. Separate the sequences and you have the most basic and outdated action b-movie there is. Car chase. Fire fight. Explosion. Present it confusing enough so it seems complex. Same goes for the plot. The rules of the dream world are not complicated at all, you are absolutely able to sum it up in two sentences, just try. The Matrix set up it's world with a 10 minute sequence and we all got it where the whole theme is about equally, or more complex. Now Nolan is either deliberately confusing people for effect or simply because he doesn't have the skills as a scriptwriter to set up a movie. Neither of the versions seems too noble, but I guess it's a combination of those.Now the fact, that no one really seems to have noticed ALL THIS this is just a total riddle to me. Even famous film critics praise this movie as ground breaking and brilliant and I just can't see, where I am totally stupid, or why I'd construe all these mistakes into the movie, when in reality, they just weren't there.It's just malpractice, as what you have here is basic movie making rules ignored in the most inelegant fashion possible and then compensating for it with - well - money. Don't get me wrong, it's not knowing the rules and then breaking them, it just looks like not knowing the rules. It's what you could expect a first year student at a mediocre film school to do where his teacher then asks him to start all over again, with the first book. And it's just so ""in your face"". For most of the time, there is really nothing more then cutaways, the characters describing what is happening and Hans Zimmer smashing while you see expensive CGI and explosions.But everything just seems so damn serious and exclusive and the music is really dramatic. How could this movie not be good, right? But it's a trick. It's the concept of visceral over-stimulation brought to a new level and I'm shocked that it works to the point where after almost a century of film making THIS is regarded as one of the best movies of all time.IMDb TOT 250 #8.

"3308","Inception",9,"Didactic, but nonetheless a good movie.","Inception has a problem that I cannot bear: the constant that someone comes to explain the laws and how that world works. The creation of the character of Ellen Page (Ariadne) was for the sole purpose of explaining that to moviegoers. Not that it's bad, but at certain moments it seems like the movie becomes more class at school, to know how that universe works, instead of the characters in this movie live the adventure for themselves. In this aspect the film is didactic. And the space for the imagination is limited. In this aspect everything in this film is chewed, everything explained, where are the possibilities? I do not want someone to explain the universe, I want to see the characters live and react in this universe.Yes the ending leaves open the question whether that is a dream or reality, but it is a cheap gimmick instead of letting them our imaginations fly. If at the end of the movie the experience of the characters was a dream, so it was waste of two and a half hour, at least the Matrix shows the characters in the real world, and that it was not a dream inside a dream. The tension and time invested would not be a waste of time Not that it spoils the experience of the film, but it disturbs in some parts, mainly in the middle of the film, when the group is preparing for the assault. The concept is good, but it should be presented in a simpler way. Clearly Nolan was very ambitious in the concept of this film. But Nolan is quite integral in the proposal of his films, and he tries to put unknown concepts to the general public in such a cohesive way, even with the problem of trying to explain everything and other problems of pace are easily forgiven. Nolan tries to do his best in each of his films as if his movie was his last, as if his life depends on it. A great honesty on the part of Nolan, and this I can and I want to enjoy. Nolan is such an honest guy and scores points with me. It's the difference between the lousy movie director and an excellent director. The bad elements of Inception are not enough to spoil its qualities. The ambitious ideas of the filmmaker and the great sequences in parallel assembly that characterize his works. Not that the idea of Inception is innovative, this idea has been copied many times in other works (Paprika, Synecdoche New York and The Matrix are the most practical and common examples). But it's the way Nolan puts these ideas in the big budget blockbuster. Let's be honest here. Smaller or lower budget films are not seen by the general public due to the absence of of large production values (a great soundtrack, great locations for filming or great special effects, etc). See these ideas or concepts in a great Hollywood blockbuster made with such quality and care, it is amazing. And these ideas are embedded in the drama of the film in such a cohesive and exemplary way; it is applauding Nolan's professional integrity. This is why Nolan movies are so well received, he tries to put in these Hollywood blockbusters something more, something common in indie or smaller films, but with the financial aspect of the great studios to provide a better technical quality.Obviously there is quality on this movie; the large parallel sequences are exemplary. The parallel between the Van sequences, the hotel with the Joseph Gordon-Levitt (when character is awake in the elevator), the peak at the military base in the snow and the desolate city of Cobb and Mal is almost perfectly made with an all- encompassing soundtrack. Of course the sequences of action are lousy . And many dialogues are very weak. Two weaknesses in Nolan's movies.Bad things come with the good things. I suspect that the bad action scenes of Inception and Dark Knight were the reason why Nolan turned DKR into an action movie instead of trying to tell a good story, Nolan's ego should have been hurt by the criticism as he directs his action scenes in these two films. Particularly Inception and the action sequence in the snow with Tom Hardy. Too bad, sorry.But the performances are amazing, particularly Marion Cotillard as Mal. There are many layers in the various characters which Nolan conducts with mastery and the way they are inserted into the film is almost perfectly. Particularly in the initial sequence (which I thought would be a scene to showcase special effects, and Nolan proved me wrong). Or in the scene between Ariadne and Cobb, when Cobb tries to explain how his wife dies, and then discovered new layers of the character to reveal that in fact, he did have to do with the death of his wife. Of course this will be important to the outcome of the film. It is this ability to put the scenes and the flashbacks in certain key moments of the plot that Nolan shows much quality, and one of his long lists of virtues. Inception is a movie like any movie; it has its flaws, but also its virtues. But, for me the qualities overlap the defects, and in the end the movie is well worth watching. But is its legendary statute being worthy? If Inception was released in the 1980's would it have the same impact in that decade, as it had in 2010? Currently the commercial movies in Hollywood are in crisis. We live in an era of remakes, superhero movies and franchise fatigue without the studios or directors making an effort to improve with originality or at least with a little more original concepts. Inception's credit could be lower if today's Hollywood was not in such a decadent state. But nonetheless, Inception is still a good movie."
"3309","Inception",1,"A fake ""thinking person's movie""","I cannot phrase it better, so I will quote Rex Reed who called Inception's storyline ""prattling drivel."" A friend claimed Inception is a ""thinking person's movie"", but a thinking person will realize that it is only masquerading as a thinking person's movie. At bottom, intellectually, ""there is no there there."" Add to this that someone clearly believed the film needed to be pumped up with overwrought drama to qualify it as a ""summer blockbuster."" I couldn't wait for it to end, and when it did, the intrusiveness of the loud, schlocky music over the closing credits seemed to crystallize all the incipient negative feelings I had been having throughout the movie. I hope that this director will go back to doing smaller films that do not stretch his concepts beyond what they can support."
"3310","Inception",1,"So bad","My high expectations of this movie based on its no. 3 position in the Top 250 lasted for about 2 seconds into the movie. What a disgrace! And so childish. And Tiring! How can it be that everyone likes this movie. It's absolutely overloaded with bizarre and completely arbitrary turns of plot that have to be explained for about 75% of the movie. No character! No excitement, I could not even tell who were the bad guys. And yet again a few seconds of Michael Caine to camouflage the complete cardboard appearance of the entire cast! What is the meaning of this movie? What is it about? Uhhh???? Its internal logic is utter bullshit. Its emotional significance is zero, empty, frightening.Can please somebody agree with me, I feel so sad.Kurosawa come alive!"
"3311","Inception",4,"Great cast very hard to follow the point of this movie","This had a lot of talented actors and some nice visual effects. Sadly I could not get into the story this movie was trying to convey. Just didn't make sense to me.Leonardo has been in two flops that I just saw within a year and the other is Shutter Island.. I wouldn't waste your time trying to watch either of these movies. In closing I always like to see Ken Watanabe.Some movies that were similar to this that I really liked were the Matrix and The Fountain. This movie is nowhere near the caliber of those movies and I find it hard to compare this movie to anything, but way - WAY over rated. I really liked the movies Knight and Day with Tom Cruise and recommend that and also Resident Evil : Afterlife with Milla Jovovich."
"3312","Inception",7,"Inception: A Smart Movie For Ignorant People","I'm afraid I'm a bit confused. I saw ""Inception"" last night. I had high expectations based on miles of positive ink from reviewers and professional critics, all tripping over themselves to bestow demigod status upon Christopher Nolan. These expectations were dashed to bits within the first thirty minutes of the film, and turned to a kind of dread as I realized what folks these days will accept as ""depth"" in their entertainment. I wish I'd never seen those gushing reviews, I would've enjoyed the film much more. Now, don't get me wrong, I'm a fan of Christopher Nolan's Batman reboots ""Batman Begins"" and ""The Dark Knight."" For my money, those were without a doubt the second and third most effective superhero movies to date (sorry, Raimi wins.) The man certainly knows how to keep a story moving along, and he knows how to film action. In the case of The Dark Knight, Heath Ledger provided an emotional lynchpin non-pareil in his Joker portrait, and Nolan milked it for all it was worth. There was real pathos and genuine mortal horror built into the foundation of the film's impressive structure. Also, the fact that it was based on a comic book lowered the bar and allowed the audience to suspend just enough disbelief to allow most of the dorky plot elements to slip through and do their work. Now let's discuss obvious comparisons to an earlier effort in this veinthat is, an action movie dolled up to the nines as philosophical treatise. I'll admit that I was never a fan of The Matrix. I thought it was asinine in conception and brutish in execution, even as I admired some of the visual effects and spectacular stunt work. Comparing The Matrix's ridiculous endless ""stream-of-consciousness"" gibberish about free will with, say, Roy Batty's laconic final soliloquy in Blade Runner, is like comparing the Twilight series' moronic teen romantic angst with David Foster Wallace. Unfortunately, Inception had precisely the same effect on me, which is to say very little. Here we find the great and terrible Nolan exploring the tired territory already plundered in countless films of yore, including Hitchcock's Spellbound and 1980's genre pics such as Brain Storm, The Dead Zone, and Dreamscape. The basic premise reads like a dime store sci-fi novel's back cover: ""In the future, we can enter into each other's dreams! Feel the magic of dreams, within dreams, within dreams! Experience the thrill and wonder of miraculous ""Dream Time<U+0099>."" Oh Boy!"" Within twenty minutes of the film's somewhat intriguing intro, I knew not only how it would endI also pretty much knew how we were getting there. Nolan plays primarily to the back row, andno offense, Americabut we've been slightly dumbed down over the past few decades, and we're much easier as a whole to entertain than we used to be. Look back at a few films of the past with vast, labyrinthine plot structures like Hawk and Faulkner's ""The Big Sleep"", or practically anything by the Coen Brothers. What's defines their deep-impact gravitas, as opposed to the flat and diffuse emotional landscape of Inception? It's character development, pure and simple. In this case, Nolan didn't have a single character especially the one played with typically earnest gusto by Leo Dicapriowith a plausibly human fatal flaw, foible, or reason for doing<U+0085> uh, whatever it was he was doing. We're simply dropped into an alternate universe with rules seemingly invented to favor nerds of any stripe almost impossibly similar to the one in The Matrixand told to hold onto our hats, because here<U+0085> we<U+0085> go! Except we're not actually GOING anywhere, or at least not anywhere we haven't been a thousand times before. Sorry to rain on the parade of everyone that's ready to lionize C. Nolan as the great white hope of modern blockbuster cinema, but from my vantage, there is no there there. If you want a lesson in basic existential philosophy, take a class at your local community college. You'll get more out of it, and you can keep your textbook as a souvenir. If it's great car chases you're after, rent ""The French Connection,"" or ""Ronin."" In other words, keep your high-octane action movie out of my high-concept art film. These are two tastes that do not go great together. Meanwhile, if Inception somehow does ""become a religion"" in another five years, than I'm reconsidering my continued faith in Hollywood as some kind of egalitarian oracle, where the huddled masses can go to get their myths, and feel the true power of redemption. If this is the kind of movie that will be worshipped from now on, than the god of blockbuster cinema may truly be dead."
"3313","Inception",1,"The Emperors New Clothes","Contrary to the opinions of the deluded army of comic reading Nolan fanboy geeks who have descended on IMDb, Christopher Nolan has entirely and irrevocably disappeared up his own self inflated backside with this movie. I say The Emperors New Clothes because the director will sneer at anyone who doesn't understand the film and he has thus created a perfect defence mechanism. I'm sure Di Caprio et al had in depth briefings about the narrative and can explain it verbatim but us viewers are left to work it out for ourselves. And it's so full of holes, so full of irrelevant tripe and so full of itself that it isn't easy. It's incredible that its been voted the 3rd best film of all time by IMDb users. I mean seriously, that's a joke. The fanboys all want to laud Nolan as the new Kubrick (another joke) but in doing so they have voted this tosh above ALL of Kubricks work. It's such a smug self congratulatory film from the get go and it just gets smugger as time drags on.Now of course I appreciate that you can go too far in explaining every detail to the viewer with unnecessary script mechanics that insult the viewers intelligence. However, although you can go too far in explaining, you can also go too far in NOT explaining and expect the viewer to grasp in a single viewing what is a massively complex concept film - and one that's so badly flawed in so many areas for it to undermine the whole 'intellectual' nature of it. The idea of the film is OK and the film does have its moments but there are so many scenes that don't make sense that it spoils it entirely. I appreciate that 'heist' movies are usually procedural and that Nolan wanted to avoid that but in doing so he's created the most self-indulgent picture ever.I could go on about the snow scene, the thoroughly implausible way these people not only do what they do but 'assemble' as a team, the oh-I'm-Christoper-so-considerably-cleverer-than-you-are-Nolan backstory with Di Caprio's wife but I'm not going to pick apart the scenes because I'd be here for hours and I haven't got the energy left after enduring this nonsense. Besides; everything could be spun that he meant this or that (he isn't as deep as he likes you to think). Inception is all fur coat and no knickers. It explains so little of what is going on that I left feeling angry. And I generally get these films so it's not a case of me being some moronic fool who struggles to follow the weather. And billed as a completely original idea? Nah. There's obvious similarities with The Matrix, Dreamscape, Total Recall, Flatliners, Vanilla Sky, Pan's Labyrinth, Dream Demon and even one of the Star Trek Next Generation Episodes centred around the holodeck, all of which I've 'gotten' - the good ones, the bad ones, the ones you ponder for days afterwards. The fact is with this abomination I simply can't be bothered to think about it because I really don't care. I don't care about the characters, I don't care about the ending (which was excruciatingly predictable) and I don't care about how clever Nolan thinks he is. You're not mate. You've pulled a massive con with this film by creating a movie where you can call people stupid if they don't get it / like it. You get to sneer and snigger at the stupid little people. You've taken your previous successes to the movie execs and they've foolishly allowed themselves to fund your rampant self indulgence. That's what irritates me the most about this utter piffle. I understood what was understandable about this film and there are of course films where the intention is to purposely let the viewer fill in the gaps with their own imagination (generally a nice touch) but that simply isn't the case here. The story script and indeed most of the awful acting (outside of Di Caprio, Juno girl and Cillian Murphy) neither holds it together nor papers over the cracks of a weak script that's trying to be oh so deep... and badly failing.This is over 120 minutes of my life that I will never ever get back and I simply couldn't wait for the film to end. I had lost all interest in any of the characters, their backstorys or indeed the 'mission' after an hour once I woke up to the fact that he was clearly unable to pull the film together into something coherent and genuinely contemplative. And judging by the rest of the audience and the people I was with, I wasn't the only person who left feeling bitterly cheated. I congratulate Nolan on creating hysteria, mass hypnosis and hype because he's clearly managed to brainwash a lot of the audience into making them think they've seen a clever film. That's the only inception.Go and see this insidious fluff for a visual experience perhaps (even then; visually it's pretty overrated). But don't be surprised if you feel a strange peer group pressure to tell whoever you go to see it with that you understood it all when you probably didn't (or if you did; that you actually care and did so in spite of a dumb script).Nolan is not nor ever will be Kubrick. Kubrick would have done this film justice - after he had rewritten the script, changed half the cast, removed 45 minutes of length and replaced it with sensible content that made the film engaging and cohesive. I fear the next set of people to be duped will be those who vote for this trite idiocy come the Oscars.BTW I wager that Nolan watched Guy Ritchies Revolver and liked it. Congratulations Christopher, you have just descended to his level of filmmaking.Meh."
"3314","Inception",5,"Inception? More Like Insipid","""Inception"" might have been a better movie -- and would certainly have been more entertaining -- had writer/director Christopher Nolan not made his premise so complicated that the film had to spend its entire 2:25 running time explaining itself to its audience.Seriously, the exposition Never. Stops. There were literally moments during action sequences where one character would pause and explain what was going on to another character, which of course was a ham-fisted way of explaining it to us. But even with all of that aggressive exposition, the movie never does make a lot of sense. The result is a lot of busyness -- oh, there's always plenty of stuff going on -- that's nevertheless pretty boring because it's never clear what all of the busyness is for.Nolan has done this to us before. Who the hell came out of ""The Prestige"" with any clue what that movie was about? And even his more narratively coherent films (like ""The Dark Knight"") suffer from a lack of humor and a burden of philosophical pondering that the premises can't support. ""Inception"" is no exception (ha!). The movie is junk trying to disguise itself as something important and significant. How much more fun it would have been if it had just been content to be junk.Grade: C-"
"3315","Inception",4,"A 4 Masquarading as a 10","I am astonished by the reviews posted. My only explanation is that this deadly dull movie put everyone else to sleep and they thought they saw a better movie. The performances were very lackluster and the actors all (except for Tom Hardy) looked like they were performing in their sleep.There was no reason for any of the characters to be involved in this plan from a personal motivation reason, and their behaviours were completely arbitrary. Did they get paid for their time or was there some other reason to what they were doing in this scheme with the main character? I felt no connection or empathy for the main character or his motivation. There was no sense of unreality or mystery one would expect in a dream. The action sequences were dull and seemed to be just shooting people because there was a perceived need to have some gun fire. I struggled to stay in the theatre and see it through let alone stay awake."
"3316","Inception",1,"Overlong and Overrated","I don't get all the positive reviews for this movie. I found it overlong and I could not find a reason to care about any of the characters. Technically speaking, there was no true heroic character, as it was a bunch of technologically-advanced criminals and their victims. At several points during the movie I was pleading ""Go home! Go home!"" It had a decent idea but I have to think that Rod Serling (RIP) probably could have done a much better job with this and he would have done it in a shorter time. I really think the writers and producers could have made a tighter film with better and more interesting characters. Christopher Nolan did terrific, terrific work with Batman Begins and The Dark Knight, but this film is unworthy of its success."
"3317","Inception",1,"A nightmare.","This movie is a disaster on many levels, but where it fails most miserably is at attempting to put dreams on screen. This movie is the most un-dreamy movie ever made, and as critics have said since the beginning of moving pictures, watching a movie is like dreaming with your eyes open. Colin McGinn covers this in great depth in his book ""The Power of Movies"", in which he discusses the spatio-temporal discontinuity in films: the camera can record a given scene and then leap to another place and time entirely. This is what movies do! Nolan treats this heavy-handed hopping about as if he's discovered something. What he's lost is the mysterious, moody, enigmatic quality of dreams, the tremendous emotional wallop. ""Inception"" is so detailed, so measured, with constant explication, that nothing is left to the imagination. How ironic is that? And to fill a movie about dreams with carefully designed car chases, gun battles, and mayhem of all kind...it's anti-dreaming. I've never watched a film so awake, so aware of itself, so full of itself. A hundred years from now when cultural historians look at this era of Runaway Bigism - Big Government, Big Corporations, Big Bodies! - they can use over-blown and spiritually empty films like this (and ""Dark Knight"") as good examples of what ruined the country. Wretched excess."
"3318","Inception",1,"Rather primitive","Well, it's of course not 1 out of 10, more like 4, but in the light of current rating 9 out of 10 and climbing I'd give it a negative number. Please, please, please ignore its IMDb rating - it's becoming more and more meaningless. The idea for the plot is actually pretty interesting and some scenes are original but that's pretty much it. Each and every character is one-dimensional and shallow, the political setting is such a cliché and ending is easily predictable. There is a lot of stupid and unneeded chasing and shooting, punching and kicking, very much like in cheap Chinese movies. Which is fine in itself if all that you expect is an action movie, but if you expect something more memorable, then just skip it in theatres and rent a DVD in a few months. While watching such movies there is feeling that it's made like a puzzle from predefined pieces. Each piece was seen million of times before and the whole does not add anything on its own. I wholeheartedly agree that shooting a movie is not easy, and nobody can probably generate enough fresh ideas to produce a masterpiece each time. This time Nolan produced a mediocre result, let's wish him next time to make less primitive and more interesting show."
"3319","Inception",2,"Mindless action film about the mind...","I could explain the devices that drive the action, but that would take away the jobs of all the archetypes in the film who's job it is to endlessly spout exposition that will explain the nonsensical and unaffecting action you see on the screen.If you think one level of action clichés is enough to rot your brain to a sub-100 IQ level, imagine SEVERAL levels of action clichés, all explained for you in a ""hey this isn't very interesting but we've created a world and have to explain it so we can get back to the gunfights in a dreamworld"".I'd probably put this down as one of the most empty viewing experiences I've ever had in my 40 years of movie-going. I want my money and 120 minutes (I left early) back."
"3320","Inception",7,"Gimmicks For Sale","Brilliant technical wizardry. Heady, at least apparently so. A ride more than a movie but a movie none the less. Chris Nolan is rapidly becoming the director of his generation and I'm longing to find out what is he trying to say. He has established his technical power again and again but if I think of ""Memento"" for instance I remember the gimmick but not what the story was really about. I suspect the same will be said of ""Inception"". I'm not putting down, I'm just wondering. I left the theater full of questions and nobody could actually give me any answers. I'm not talking about the plot but at the way Christopher Nolan chose to tell the story. Leonardo Di Caprio is acquiring some extra gravitas as an adult presence on the screen.Loved Cillian Murphy, I always do. Riveted by Tom Hardy. Enchanted by Marion Cotillard. Amused by Joseph Gordon-Levitt and delighted by Ellen Page. I wonder what Mr Nolan will do for an encore."
"3321","Inception",1,"Glad I woke up","Apart from being a boring and absolutely stupid movie, there are some other points that bother me. 1) Both this movie and TDK got up to the top 5 of IMDb without any evident reason, which makes me suspect there is a ring of ""paid"" contributors bringing the movie up. Once it is off the cinema, it will start dropping, as ""real"" people give the votes and not the dream-reviewers. 2) I actually believe in the perspective of the dead wife; the whole reality is ultimately a dream and a creation of our own consciousness. What bothers me is how my subconsciousness could create such a crappy and meaningless movie."
"3322","Pride & Prejudice",10,"brilliance took two decades to arrive","before i start, i would like to say this. i can read, have read the book, and i read the title of the movie before watching, as should you all. quite disappointed in all the pompous idiots filled with prejudice about the movie.I know that another version of the well-mined Jane Austen classic would need to be brilliant indeed. Such diverse and beautifully written characters and such a delightful plot, so deeply rooted in a profound understanding of human nature, are timelessly attractive to directors, actors and audiences alike. So give them a break. you couldn't do any better.Lets start with Mr Darcy. Darcys embodied by Olivier, Firth and now Matthew McFadyen bring differently significance to enjoy in the proud and socially awkward leading male role. Where Olivier and Firth gave us an aloof, arrogant Darcy encased rigidly in a shell so impenetrable it was almost impossible to believe he had been moved by Lizzie's sardonic criticisms or attracted by her spirited independence, McFadyen shows a more accessible Darcy. He's vulnerable, even fragile behind his stiff manners. His aloofness is more believably from social inadequacy than arrogance, yet he is believably constrained by his social standing to regard decorum, fortune and propriety in a wife's family as significant in his choice of a bride. His capitulation to Lizzie is therefore more believable.Similarly Garson, Ehle and Keira Knightley illustrate the lively intelligence, sharp-minded wit and wry humour of Elizabeth Bennet in equally shining ways that nevertheless bring out different aspects of the character. Keira Knightly's performance as Elizabeth Bennett is by far her best, as she sparkles in this role.The two have a chemistry that i had yet to see on the big or small screen - one that mirrors real life romances. the dislike on both accounts is obvious, watching it grow to love was beautiful and stunning. the love story is heart-felt and sweetly, deeply affecting to a level that modern romantic comedies rarely achieve. I found this movie to be a a richly photographed, memorable ensemble production in which the romance is predominant over the drama but does not eclipse it. though my one disappointment - the ending?! of course i wanted to see them kiss, who didn't? but the shots of them arguing in the rain, and as they draw close with the sunlight shining between them was breathtaking.Giving due significance to the rural environment which plays such an important part in the story, the cinematography captures wide frames of soft, misty fields, copses and winding country roads as an environment which underscores the gentle manners and passionately beating hearts beneath empire gowns and ruffled shirts. The surroundings both detract from the humans and function as appropriately natural settings for the dramas of human nature.Keira Knightley's swan-like Elizabeth moves with energy and grace, hotly opinionated and profoundly moved by principles and prejudices, and magnetically drawn by the seeming arrogance, reticence and gallant behaviour, finally revealed, of Mr Darcy. For two centuries Elizabeth Bennet has been a heroine much admired for her self-contained independence within a culture more conditioned to female submissiveness. Knightley's portrayal is true to the original.All in all, i must give this movie 5 stars, 10 out of 10, 100 % brilliance. The story itself, the characters, the actors, everything that was in the movie 'bewitched me body and soul'. i have never been more moved by a movie, especially not one where i found it to be as hilarious as it was moving."
"3323","Pride & Prejudice",9,"Spirited Modern Interpretation of Austen's Classic Love Story","A ""modernised"" version of Jane Austen's classic novel that should not be compared unfavourably with 1940 Hollywood Olivier / Garson version nor several BBC serials culminating in the most acclaimed TV series version from 1995 with Colin Firth & Jennifer Ehle-a personal favourite. This 2005 film clocks in 127 minutes (UK / Europe)& 135 minutes (USA & Canada) -the extended version allowing audiences to share more of the timeless love story with the main characters -Elizabeth Bennet & Mr Darcy. Director Joe Wright plus his screenwriters ( Oscar winner Emma Thompson contributed to the final screenplay) have chosen to emphasise Elizabeth Bennet / Mr Darcy plus Jane Bennet/ Mr Bingley story lines & reduce Mr Wickman, Charlotte & Mr Collins to supporting characters.Austen's famous wit,satire & humour that forms the basis for her enduring appeal (Pride & Prejudice was finally published in 1813 & continues as an annual bestseller)is sidelined to open up this version as more emotional drama for modern audiences.If you are open to a newer interpretation, can avoid comparisons to the nearly 5 hour 1995 TV version which allowed for greater depth & detail in telling all the characters story lines & accept some of the new film's rushed story lines-you are in for a treat .....New British star Keira Knightley (Elizabeth Bennet))excels in her first real leading actress role ably supported by fellow Brit Rosamund Pike (Jane Bennet) as the sisters supportive of each other's & their Bennett family problems.Knightley at 20 is the right age for her character,this allows Elizabeth's girlish personality plus her character's pride, misjudgements & loving nature to shine through....Great star turns from Brenda Blethyn as their mother Mrs Bennet plus Oscar winner Judi Dench as fearsome Lady De Bourgh (Mr Darcy's aunt)add depth to this film version.Claudie Blakley as Elizabeths's wise friend Charlotte Lucas & Simon Wood's amusing Mr Bingley are delightful supporting performers. One major surprise is Canadian actor Donald Sutherland's touching performance as Mr Bennet -capturing both the humour of living in an all female household & five daughters to look after with the poignancy of seeing his eldest children's difficult relationships develop -easily his best acting performance in years. In the difficult role of Mr Darcy rising British star Matthew Macfadyen (BBC's Spy series Spooks & Award winning New Zealand film ""In My Father's Den"" rises to the occasion.With the short running time, there is not enough time to allow Darcy's repressed & prejudiced personality to be fully represented -Macfadyen perfectly displays Darcy's social & class problems, his unfortunate attempts at gaining Eliabeth Bennet's interest & his painful adjustments to achieve their personal love story.Macfayden & Knightley's objectionable first dance,their embarrassingly moving Collins House meeting,the unexpected Pemberley encounter plus their two proposal scenes are highlights of this film. Engaging acting performances with wondrous film photography,film locations at some of United Kingdom's most famous stately homes, marvellous film sets & costumes plus one of 2005's best original music scores add greatly to this new film version. All in all one of the better films of 2005 -not perfect film making and not intended to be as subtle as Austen's novel -but a wonderful surprise with some changes to present a modern version of Pride & Prejudice for current audiences -do see this film as & when it is released worldwide....And after seeing the film or re-visiting 1995 BBC TV series -read the original novel for its classic storyline, memorable characters & Austen's brilliant writing style,wit & humour.....9 Out Of 10 for this different interpretation of an enduring classic"
"3324","Pride & Prejudice",10,"Jane Austen for ever","Jane Austen's tale of love and economics reaches us once more with the energy of a thorough novelty. ""Pride and Prejudice"" has been a favorite novel of mine since I first read it and I've seen Laurence Olivier and Greer Garson, Colin Firth and Jennifer Ehle and now Matthew MacFadyen and Kiera Knightly. Amazingly enough I've never been disappointed. The material seems to be full proof. Colin Firth's Darcy, in many ways, is the Darcy I've always imagined. He's been an actor I've followed feverishly since his glorious Adrian LeDuc in ""Apartment Zero"", Matthew MacFadyen was totally new to me but he managed to create that sense of longing that makes that final pay off so satisfying. Kiera Knightly is a ravishing revelation. I must confess, I didn't remotely imagined that she was capable of the powerful range she brilliantly shows here. The other big surprise is Joe Wright, the director, in his feature film debut which is more than promising, it's extraordinary. The photography, the art direction and the spectacular supporting cast, in particular Donald Sutherland and Brenda Blethyn, makes this new version of a perennial classic a memorable evening at the movies"
"3325","Pride & Prejudice",10,"Outstanding...MacFadyen is a worthy Darcy.","Outstanding ... MacFadyen is a worthy Darcy and a darned good actor to boot! The scenery, backgrounds, and country folk were much more realistic than previous versions. The costumes and hairdos also seemed in keeping with the times. Another great addition is the priceless Donald Sutherland who, in a perfect world, would have had more scenes with Judy Densch. If those two can't chew up the scenery, nobody can. And, finally, Keira Knightly is a jewel. Her beauty is so apparent that it almost detracts from the fact that this is a very good actress who can hold her own in any room. This was a delight and I only wish that it could have been 6 hours long."
"3326","Pride & Prejudice",10,"Acting is superb","While I will say first off, that no movie production ever made will ever equal a novel, especially one of this magnitude, this movie is very well done. I read many reviews going either way, but I must say I enjoyed the film very much. Many are quick to criticize Mac's performance saying he didn't do a good job. I thought he was fine, but believe me he is no Colin. Keira Knightley was absolutely incredible in the film, I would go as far to say it is her breakout performance. Donald Sutherland was amazing, but as can be expected from him. Judi, like always is incredible at her role as Lady Catherine.If you are a complete avid fan of the book as I am, you may or may not like it. My only complaint was that it was in fact short, but then again it is quite hard to make a 370+ page novel into a two hour movie easily. There is a phenomenal display of acting by the entire cast, and the score is perfect.One warning though, the movie concentrates on the love story more than Austen's satire of society, so many Austen fans may be angry with that. But overall I thought it was a great film."
"3327","Pride & Prejudice",10,"A timeless adaptation of a timeless Jane Austen novel.","The fantastic romantic world of Jane Austen again makes its way to the silver screen in Joe Wright's new adaptation of the classic novel Pride and Prejudice. It is the first feature film to be adapted from it in 65 years, and believe me when I say it does not disappoint. This adaptation is, for lack of a better word, a BRILLIANT achievement that keeps you actively involved from the first scene to the very last scene, just about consuming you with aching romance <U+0096> and it is sprinkled with humour and intelligence.Still taking place in the late 1700s and still interweaving its story with timeless emotion, pride, narrow-mindedness and love, Pride and Prejudice (2005) zooms in on the Bennet household in class-conscious, stuck-up England. In this household, we follow five spirited sisters under the idealism of their overbearing mother (a superbly neurotic Brenda Blethlyn providing for the comic relief) who desperately wants them all to marry and thereby secure the future of the family estate. But the standout sister and protagonist in the film, Lizzie (Keira Knightley) is clever enough to have other ideas, but alas too romantic to carry them out... *sigh*When reviewing period films such as this one, one often focuses on the setting and costume design. I believe this is done because they are often better crafted than the actual story. But in Pride and Prejudice (2005), the stormy emotions of its characters<U+0096>bottled up but bubbling to get out<U+0096>completely consume the entire film and places understated set designs in the backseat. Only when it was consciously put forward, like when Lizzie Bennet was admiring the beautiful architecture and Greek statues of Mr. Darcy's estate, did I ever notice the background <U+0096> and it was, of course, extraordinary. A similar state displaying the dynamics of its central cast should be attributed to the grand dancing scene between Lizzie and Mr. Darcy <U+0096> the two are so absorbing that when Wright purposely fades out the the rest of the dancing crowd, you do not notice a change. Your eyes are still solely Knightley and Macfadyen. It took me three viewings to realise this. As for acting performances then, the unspeakably lovely Keira Knightley has finally done it. She has proved me wrong with a truly Oscar-worthy performance and she does it without crying, worrying, moping and sighing like the other nominees that year. Knightley is in fact all about sweet subtlety here, bringing a fantastic presence to her high-spirited character Lizzie. She is the type of character that every girl and woman in the world can identify with and with Knightley behind her to give her oomph, you will not find a more likable creature in films this year. MacFayden is completely satisfactory as Lizzie's love interest Mr. Darcy, but he is no Colin Firth <U+0096> lacking in charm and is a bit too wooden. But no matter, because these two have the best on-screen chemistry I have ever seen. I'm not kidding, this was sensational. Such magnetism. It is highlighted from scene 1, playfully touching upon their sexual tension and gradually turning it into feverish love that sends chills down your spine.Every last actor in the cast of Pride and Prejudice (2005) gets to shine in their character<U+0096>from Dame Judi Dench as a cold rich lady to Donald Sutherland as caring Mr Bennet, all except Jena Malone whose all too Valley-girl American attitude was distracting and annoyingly anachronistic. But it is Knightley who is in focus and who propels the film with her warm charisma. It is impossible not to fall in love with the main characters, and I say this as someone who avoids romance-themed films and who does not care for period films. This is a truly timeless story and this film will hopefully be remembered, celebrated and praised for breathing life into it with such passion.10/10 (which is a rare grade for me)"
"3328","Pride & Prejudice",10,"Absolutely Perfect 2 Hour Adaptation!","For years I have waited for a Pride and Prejudice that perfectly captured the wit, the intelligence, the passion and the romance of Jane Austen's classic. The 1995 mini is fabulous, and I have watched it many times, but I have always been frustrated that while it got so much of the dialogue and the detail right, it somehow fell flat on some of the more subtle dynamics of the novel.Finally this movie adaption has captured what has before been missing! True, it took license regarding some of the verbiage and detail of the novel, but it ultimately completely captured the characters, their transformations, their strengths, their vulnerabilities and their passions. You simply cannot do a definitive work on Pride and Prejudice in two hours. And this film doesn't try. But what it does attempt--to capture the story and characters, it does beautifully. It is well acted, well directed and connects as the book connected. While it has to rush and skimp on scenes and characters, it is the most authentic and true to the spirit of the novel version that I have ever seen. You simply do not want it to end...Well done!!!! It was about time!!!"
"3329","Pride & Prejudice",NA,"Three weddings and no funeral","This quintessentially English film is utterly charming - a very traditional interpretation of Jane Austen's 1813 novel that manages to entertain, amuse and even move. First time director Joe Wright has worked with television playwright Deborah Moggach's script and a wonderful collection of mainly British actors to delight us. The versatile camera-work, luscious countryside, grand settings, period costumes, and atmospheric music are evidence of a work on which much love has been lavished.At the heart of this triumph is the delightful 20 year old Keira Knightley as the assured and sharp Elizabeth Bennett, the second of five daughters looking to be married off by an anxious mother. Knightley's rise in the thespian firmament has been meteoric and this is her best performance to date in a role for which she is perfectly cast. Matthew MacFadyen is suitably brooding and gauche as Mr Darcy, but the cast list is enlivened with splendid British character actors, including Brenda Blethyn as Lizzie's irascible mother, Tom Hollander as a diminutive cleric seeking a wife, and Judi Dench as the formidable Lady Catherine, plus the Canadian Donald Sutherland (Lizzie's wise father).This is a Georgian world in which social conventions present a veritable minefield for indiscretions or misunderstandings and in which a formal dance can be as intricate an occasion as international diplomacy. Pride and prejudice are only two of the obstacles to be overcome before inevitably true love brings Lizzie and her dark knight nose to nose (we don't even see a kiss). Passionate stuff indeed."
"3330","Pride & Prejudice",NA,"The Benny Hill version of P&P which should be called 'Shy and Miserable'","I really hated this - it is OK to modify scenes from the book, but to change the spirit of it completely is too much. And to change Jane Austen's witty dialogue for some of the dross, especially early on in the piece was definitely not an improvement.This loud, grubby group were not my idea of the Bennetts or their friends. The Bennetts may have been poor and may well have lived in a shabby house, but they had more class than this lot.As for the proposition that Darcy's aloofness was because he shy and not confident, he just seemed pathetic to me and Darcy should certainly not be pathetic. Except for the scene where he gave a lovely smile - Mathew MacFadyen wore the same expression pretty much throughout, (which was not surprising as this Darcy was such a boring character), and Kiera Knightly just seemed much to flighty for Lizzy, she seemed more like Lydia.To me - it is the Benny Hill version of P&P - no subtlety, little wit, almost just slapstick.Thank God for the BBC."
"3331","Pride & Prejudice",9,"Pride and Prejudice-Simply unmissable","Pride and Prejudice was an absolutely fantastic film. A great cast, and Keira Knightly did an excellent job and Matthew Macfadyen was a wonderful in the role of Mr Darcy. The cinematography was so ridiculously good, there were some fantastic shots and the costumes were also fantastic. The script was fairly good, it is true to the classic by Jane Austen, Mr Wickam could have made more of an appearance, and had a striking resemblance to one Orlando Bloom. The movie moved fairly fast but trying to fit such a novel into two hours had to be hard anyway, so I say well done to all involved, as such a beloved book can be a hard project to take on, but after watching it I really can't wait until to see it again!!!"
"3332","Pride & Prejudice",9,"A most diverting film!","Having attended a regional charity premiere last night I can safely say that the actors chosen have more than succeeded in bringing their characters to life. This adaptation hit the perfect note every time in terms of humour, romance and warmth. Keira Knightley plays a wonderfully spirited Lizzie and MacFayden really hits the spot as a dour yet shy Darcy. The whole cast throw themselves into their roles with gusto and overall the film left this viewer charmed and delighted. Its obviously going to have a tough time proving itself to those who loved the BBC adaptation as that seems to have become for so many THE adaptation of the novel, but give this one a chance, those that don't will be missing out. Sorry to keep this brief but I don't want to be accused of giving anything away!"
"3333","Pride & Prejudice",1,"Should we rejoice at the inferiority of this rendition?","For the sake of starting with something positive, let's throw out the very biggest problems like historical placement and accuracy. If we can get stupid enough to ignore a boat load of adaptation problems, we might at least admit that this movie was beautifully designed and very well shot. Watch this monstrosity with the sound off, and you'll enjoy some remarkable cinematography.But no lavish castles or livid sunrises can rescue such a mess.First, we'd have to cut off the head of the beast in terms of raw materials and leadership. The screenplay borders on jabberwocky, honoring only the most banal of Austen's dialog. And despite being the consummate romance, director Joe Wright isn't able to coax anything more than a lukewarm shrug from any of the key players.Speaking of key players, let's look at casting.Keira Knightley (Pirates of the Caribbean, King Arthur) reduces the smart and self-possessed Elizabeth to little more than teen petulance. She strides triumphant through the movie, always armed with some well worn leather-bound tome (we can safely assume it's not Stanislavski), looking for ways to disarm people with her aplomb. Unfortunately, Knightley has a limited number of tools with which to construct the facade. One is a frightening and toothsome grin-laugh thing that turns her into a Rankin/Bass villain (a'la Burgermeister, the Bumble, HeatMiser, etc). The rest of the time, Knightley relies on her jutting jaw and droopy lip to illicit a blatant sexuality (which happens to be completely wrong for this character). However, instead of the intended pouty sex kitten allure, she looks as if a large dose of Thorazine is just kicking in. We half expect a ribbon of drool to escape down her chin at any moment.Then there is our darling Darcy. No one will ever touch the haughty torment of Colin Firth. Even if we hadn't seen Firth's Darcy, Macfadyen would seem a bit flat. We get precious little of his prickly pride (which is fairly significant to the story, being in the title and all). His too-soft underbelly is exposed the minute he sets eyes on Elizabeth, which irrevocably breaks the seal on his crusty credibility. The most powerful aspect of this romance (in the book & BBC version) is how it so utterly surprises Elizabeth - and us - when he makes that first proposal. Watching Macfadyen spill the beans in his first 10 seconds on screen leaves very little reason to keep watching. He could have benefited from just a bit of Caroline Bingley's over-the-top nastiness.As for the rest of the cast, they come in two flavors: shallow and boring, or giggly and squirming like cheerleaders in the back of the bus. One has to wonder if it took more than Thorazine to get the rest of the cast through this project, particularly after seeing Donald Sutherland's version of Mr. Bennett. Dreamy and completely disconnected, laudanum appears to be his buffer of choice. Of course we expect Lydia and Kitty to be a bit silly, which they are, but they both seem to be in the throes of a bad Ecstasy binge. Their squealing and twittering is relentless and positively manic. And poor Mr. Collins (actor Tom Hollander, who also plays the deliciously neurotic and ruined Anthony Meredith in Gosford Park) appears to be stoned out of his head and on the brink of full-on paranoia, although trying very ...hard ...not to be. He was definitely capable of giving David Bamber (the A&E Collins) a run for his money in this role. Unfortunately, ""big eyes and stick-up-the-arse marionette movement"" must have been Wright's direction for the unfortunate Hollander.Countless smaller irritations abound: The evil Mr. Wickham has roughly 9 words of dialog with which to make us first adore and then despise him (a fancy trick for any actor, let alone someone with no noticeable screen time). Dame Judy Dench is sadly overcast as the fiery old crone, Lady Catherine de Bourg, which is exactly the same as every other role she's been saddled with for the last 10 years. What a tragic waste. And she brought almost too much credibility to the trivial Lady Catherine. Even Charles Bingley's sunny disposition seems to be drawn in crayon. Far from the agreeable innocent we all adore, he comes off as weak and mildly retarded and seemingly incapable of combing his particularly unruly shock of ginger hair. The result is some kind of love child of Liberace and Howdy Doody. Darcy would have never befriended someone like this, and not just because of the hair. Brenda Blethyn (Little Voice, Saving Grace) turns in the only enjoyable performance as the terminally squirrelly Mrs. Bennett. At least she's fun to watch, albeit in the manner of a fuzzy rodent with a firecracker tied to her tail. But she occasionally lacked conviction in terms of her chronic ""nervous condition."" When will Hollywood learn that unless you bleed every 28 days or are named Ang Lee, you're not qualified to handle Jane Austen? Go tackle the Brontes. And there must be at least a half dozen more gladiator movies waiting to be made or remade. Heck, take Dickens on another spin around the dance floor! But leave the next Austen adaptation to the BBC, A&E, or Masterpiece Theatre where they might still care more about characters and story than honoring a 5-picture deal for the latest tarted-up teen stars."
"3334","Pride & Prejudice",1,"Hollywood trash","This is a deeply dumbed-down version of Austen.Every hairstyle is wrong, the Bennett family look and behave like Californian hippies prone to spouting (very) occasional bits of Austen dialogue.I will give you one key indicator of how badly researched and produced this film is: at one point Lady Catherine de Burgh, one of the great snobs in English literature, is handed a cup of tea by a servant and says ""thank you""!The fact that the Bennetts live in the same house that the Herberts inhabited in The Draughtsman's Contract is a surreal touch for any Greenaway fan..."
"3335","Pride & Prejudice",1,"Wretched","No one go see Pride & Prejudice. It is the most wretched, boring, miserable movie I have seen all year. Keira Knightley does not look or act the part (note how she chooses to act with her chin every time she gets emphatic) and I've sold lumber more charismatic and interesting than the man who plays Mr. Darcy. There are so many clichéd shots (if I ever have to see someone stare at a candle in the foreground for an entire shot while having a conversation, and then blow it out for the scene change, or a door slamming shut with a dull, resounding crash directly into the camera, I may scream.)Darcy is boring; Collins is boring; Bingley looks like a woman; Mrs. Bennett is not funny as she is in the BBC version, she is merely irritating. And oh the giggling. The horrid, horrid giggling. I think a good 15 minutes of this movie is comprised of giggling. Another 15 goes to ""moving"" shots of the beautiful landscape, while Lizzie stares pensively into the distance.I offer this as an especial warning to anyone who has not read the novel, who would be doing themselves a horrible disservice by seeing the movie before reading the book and watching the delightful Colin Firth BBC version - which is in every imaginable way a superior film to this sack of sugary rubbish. Thank you. It felt good to get that out of my system. Please take my advice. For your sakes."
"3336","Pride & Prejudice",1,"Ouch","This film is bad. There are no words that do justice to what this film has done to the most beloved work of one of the greatest English authors. To start with, the film cannot seem to decide when it is set. We see scenes and costumes from a plethora of different historical periods (especially in the ballroom scenes). This is nothing to the dialogue, however, which cannot decide if it wants to be modern or self-consciously antiquated. Apparently just using Austen's dialogue would be too easy. The characters' manners wouldn't fit into any period (see Georgianna Darcy in particular). The scene of Darcy's second proposal appears to have been stolen from a Mills and Boon novel. I can only imagine that the makers of this film have never read the book or were just having a laugh. Even the acting doesn't redeem it, as even great performers collapse under an absurd script. The two leads are particularly bad as they attempt to smoulder. Please do not go to see this film, as giving them money would only serve to encourage this sort of thing."
"3337","Pride & Prejudice",1,"not tolerable enough to tempt me","I think it is saying something that the Bollywood ""Bride and PRejudice"" stayed more faithful to the source material than this 2005 Hollywood version did. I also laughed more at the Bollywood version. (Mr. Kholi? Priceless!) If you have read the book or seen the 1995 BBC version (and liked them), you will be in for a nasty surprise going in to this film then. My friend however, who had seen neither, was mildly amused by the film. If you are a JAne Austen purist though, or even a film-goer who dislikes historical inaccuracies, it will be painful to sit through this.Ugh, the script. The script was the biggest problem. I imagine the actors wouldn't have fared half so badly if they'd had a decent script, perhaps penned by somebody who actually loved Austen's work.What travesties were committed? Well, you'll be forced to endure such incredulous lines as ""Don't you dare judge me, Lizzy!"" and ""Leave me alone for once in your lives!"". Not only are such lines far from anything that could come from Jane Austen's eloquent pen, but can anyone honestly believe words like that spilling from the mouth of a genteel young lady from the Regency era? The usage of modern colloquialisms is one of the many irritating ways that the screenwriter butchers the book. The writer also decided to give characters lines that, in the book, were said by a completely different characters and all for no apparent purpose. Worse of all, when they do try to stick a bit closer to the book's writing, the screenwriter has a nasty and unnecessary habit of rearranging Austen's phrases and substituting awkward synonyms for her already perfect words. It was as if the screenwriter sat down with the book in one hand and a thesaurus in the other when writing the script. Stick to Austen's words; she did it better than you! I assume all of this was done in a ""revisionist"" spirit and in an effort to distance this film from the iconic 1995 BBC version. However, for me, it also made a travesty of the true spirit of Austen's most beloved work.The casting did have potential, though it was quickly dashed away once the script kicked in. But Keira, giggling excessively and baring your crooked teeth does not equal charm and vivacity! And I think Mr. McFayden, though I find him tolerably handsome enough, misread his script and was under the impression he was playing Heathcliff and not the formidable Mr. Darcy. I really did enjoy Brenda Blethyn, Kelly Reilly and the actor who played Mr. Collins. Their interpretations were really rather refreshing.Oh, but Donald Sutherland! Somebody described his performance as seeming like a hobo who had accidentally wandered onto the movie set and I must say it is an apt description. And can somebody tell me why they fashioned Wickham after Legolas? Though he was in the movie for under two minutes, I daresay, and without his impressive archery skills to perk up the movie.On a wardrobe note, I would kill for Miss Bingley's dresses because they were sumptuous and would fit in more with the modern century. (A sleeveless Regency evening gown? Please! More Versace than Austen, that is sure) And poor Keira, all of the budget went to her salary and not her wardrobe! Oh, and I'm sure they eventually caught the bastard who stole the one hairbrush from the movie set. Unfortunately, they didn't catch him soon enough to comb the actresses' tresses before filming rolled.In short, with this new Hollywood version, bid adieu to Austen's eloquence, subtlety and wit because you'll be getting the complete opposite."
"3338","Pride & Prejudice",1,"Squalor not ""realistic"" Austen","There are many, including prominent professional critics, who commend this adaptation of ""Pride and Prejudice"" for its ""realistic"" portrayal of dirt, unkempt clothes and hair, farm animals wallowing in the living room, etc. In fact, it is not only historically unauthentic, it is false to Jane Austen. There were no such scenes of squalor included in the novel. To the contrary, Austen wrote a passage in which Elizabeth Bennet sets out on a long walk after a rain storm to visit her ailing sister, during which she soils the hem of her skirt with mud. This slight soiling results in a small amount of embarrassment for Elizabeth, who tries to let down her outer garment to hide it, and a great amount of derision behind her back by two nasty female residents of the house she is visiting. Had dirt and shabbiness been the norm in households like Elizabeth's at the time depicted, it is unlikely a little mud on the edge of a skirt would have attracted anyone's notice or rude commentary, and these events in the book would have made no sense. The fact that Austen wrote such a scene and had the characters behave as they do indicates that cleanliness and neatness of dress were normal and expected at that place and time, among that class of people."
"3339","Pride & Prejudice",1,"If you want to see one awful film this year ...","From the film's first shot - Keira Knightley as Elizabeth Bennet wandering reading through a field at dawn, thus invoking all the clichés cinema has developed to address the phenomenon of the strong-minded rebellious female character in period drama - I knew I was in for something to make me want to kill myself.Joe Wright seemed not only to have not read the book, but to be under the regrettable misapprehension that what he was filming was not in fact Jane Austen's subtle, nuanced comedy of manners conducted through sparkling, delicate social interaction in eighteenth century English drawing-rooms, but a sort of U-certificate Wuthering Heights. Thus we were treated to every scene between Elizabeth and Darcy taking place outside for no apparent reason, in inappropriately rugged scenery and often in the pouring rain. Not to mention that Jane Austen, and in particular P & P, is not about passion, sexual tension or love. It's about different strategies of negotiating the stultification of eighteenth century society. Which was completely ignored, so that the Bennets' house was a rambunctious, chaotic place where everybody shouts at once, runs around, leaves their underwear on chairs, and pigs wander happily through the house; the society balls become rowdy country dances one step away from a Matrix Reloaded style dance-orgy; and everybody says exactly what they think without the slightest regard for propriety.The genius of Jane Austen lies in exploring the void created by a society in which nobody says what they think or mean because of an overwhelming regard for propriety, and the tragic predicaments of her characters arise from misunderstandings and miscommunications enabled by that speechless gap. So both the brilliance of Jane Austen and the very factor that allows her plots - particularly in this film - to function was completely erased. Subtlety in general was nowhere int his film, sacrificed in favour of an overwrought drama which jarred entirely with the material and the performances.It was so obviously trying to be a *serious* film. The humour - which IS Pride & Prejudice, both Austen's methodology and her appeal - was almost entirely suppressed in favour of all this po-faced melodrama, and when it was allowed in, was handled so clumsily. Pride & Prejudice is a serious narrative which makes serious points, yes, but those serious points and weightier themes are not just intertwined with the humour, they are embedded in it. You can't lose Jane Austen's technique, leaving only the bare bones of the story, and expect the themes to remain. Not even when you replace her techniques with your own heavy-handed mystical-numinous fauxbrow cinematography.Elizabeth Bennett is supposed to be a woman, an adult, mature and sensible and clear-sighted. Keira Knightley played the first half of the film like an empty-headed giggling schoolgirl, and the second half like an empty-headed schoolgirl who thinks she is a tragic heroine. Elizabeth's wit, her combative verbal exchanges, her quintessential characteristic of being able to see and laugh at everybody's follies including her own, her strength and composure, and her fantastic clear-sightedness were completely lost and replaced with ... what? A lot of giggling and staring into the distance? Rather than being able to keep her head when all about her were losing theirs, she started to cry and scream at the slightest provocation - and not genuinely raging, either; no, these were petulant hissy fits. And where the great strength of Austen's Elizabeth (at least in Austen's eyes) was her ability to retain integrity and observance while remaining within the boundaries of society and sustaining impeachable propriety, Knightley's Elizabeth had no regard whatsoever for convention. Furthermore, she seemed to think that wandering around barefoot in the mud in the eighteenth century version of overalls established her beyond doubt as spirited and strong-minded, and therefore nothing in the character as written or the performance had to sustain it. An astonishingly unsubtle and bland performance. In which quest for blandness and weakness, she was ably matched by Matthew Macfayden.Donald Sutherland as Mr Bennet seemed weak, ineffectual and permanently befuddled without the wicked sense of humour and ironic detachment at the expense of human relationships that makes Mr Bennet so fascinating and tragic. His special bond with Lizzie, as the only two sensible people in a world of fools, was completely lost, not least because both of them were fools in a world of fools, and that completely deprived the end of the film of emotional impact. Mr Bingley was no longer amiable and well-meaning to the point of folly, but was played as a complete retard for cheap laughs, and the woman who was playing Jane was so wildly inconsistent that she may as well not have tried to do anything with the character at all. The script veered wildly between verbatim chunks of Jane Austen - delivered with remarkable clumsiness - and totally contemporaneous language which would not be out of place in a modern day romantic comedy.Just get the BBC adaptation on DVD and save yourself the heartache."
"3340","Pride & Prejudice",NA,"Exquisitely filmed.","Pride and Prejudice has always been one of my favourite books, so any screen incarnation has to live up to certain personal expectations of character, style etc. And of course, there is the gold standard of the 1995 BBC series, which, as other reviewers have pointed out, had the luxury of several episodes to cover a story that here takes just two hours. So I was truly delighted to enjoy this movie so much. It had a lot to live up to.The first thing I must say is that it is exquisitely photographed. The atmosphere set by the beautiful cinematography, is perfect. The film deserves to be nominated for an Oscar on that basis alone. I am in awe of the technical crew and director who could find such unspoiled vistas and such perfect weather in England, and I say that as a Brit who used to live very close to some of the eastern England locations! I sat right through to the end of the credits to see where it was shot, because I assumed it must have been filmed in some remote, rural, continental European locale. I felt quite ashamed that I had doubted the ability of my native land to still provide such delightful scenery! The mist rising off early morning fields, geese on a perfect farm pond, magnificent country estates and enormous trees more usually associated with California than England. Also perfect were the interiors. The air of genteel poverty in which the Bennets lived was well captured. The slightly down at heel scruffiness of the Bennet's farm and house, and the general dirtiness of 18th century life for most people, contrasted well with the ridiculous, rich fussiness of Lady Catherine de Bourg's house and the stark, museum-like beauty of Darcy's home.The cast were excellent. I thought Rosamunde Pike as Jane Bennet was perfect, Simon Woods as Mr Bingley was charming although perhaps a little too puppyish, I enjoyed Donald Sutherland and Brenda Blethyn as Mr and Mrs Bennet and I'm one who thinks Matthew MacFadyen did a very good job as Mr Darcy, a characterization which was slightly more user-friendly than Colin Firth's 1995 Darcy. Also outstanding were Claudie Blakley as plain Charlotte Lucas, rescued from a life of unmarried oblivion by pompous Mr Collins (a very good Tom Hollander) and Kelly Reilly, as the bitchy Miss Bingley. Is Rupert Friend (Mr Wickham) destined to play Orlando Bloom's brother? Am I alone in seeing a similarity? Of course, Keira Knightley plays the title role of Elizabeth. I have followed her career closely since Bend it Like Beckham, and I thought this easily her best acting performance so far. She captured the playfulness and wit of Lizzie's bright mind wonderfully well, and made me think long and hard how truly frustrating it must have been to be an intelligent young woman in a world that expected nothing more of her than an ability to choose ribbon and to capture a husband possessed of money. The only possible slight criticism I might make, is that Keira Knightley is perhaps a little too waif-like to pull off the 18th century characterization entirely convincingly. She is stunningly beautiful, but her stick thin appearance alongside her more robust looking screen sisters, made her look as if Mr Bennet might well have doubted her parentage!"
"3341","Pride & Prejudice",1,"Thank goodness many agree with me","I am a great lover of Austen's works, especially Pride & Prejudice. The 1995 miniseries is so faithful to the novel its astounding. The actors are well chosen, there isn't modernized language thrown in, and each emotion is handled well. You can't help having your heart skip a beat when Elizabeth and Darcy finally realize they both love each other. You hate Caroline Bingley and Mrs Hurst. But in this latest adaption, its hard to swallow. There is no Mrs. Hurst. The Bennett family look much poorer than they are. Elizabeth walks/dresses/acts in a manner so against what women of that time would. Yes, Elizabeth Bennet is unconventional, but more in the fact that she is not afraid to express her opinions. She is, however, socially capable and proper in the way she carries herself, dresses, etc. In this, Keira walks around in cruddy clothes, and acts as though she should be down on the farm in the Midwestern USA. The scene where Elizabeth and Darcy ""can't sleep"" drove me insane. SHe would never walk out in that! The scene where Bingley just enters Jane's room as well...he would never have done that! If you haven't read the novel or seen the 1995 adaption, you'd probably love this movie. But those who love the novel or love the adaption (or both) will be very disappointed. Why there was a need to adapt this novel again, I don't know. I have nothing left to say. I know Austen would be very unhappy should she be able to see this latest movie."
"3342","Pride & Prejudice",1,"Why another Pride and Prejudice?","OK where do I begin? First the writing: the idiot who wrote this screenplay thought himself superior in writing to Jane Austen and decided to replace Austen's superb economy of words with his own ramblings. Second of all the whole story completely lacks the understanding of social interactions and mores that governed the early 19th century British society. At the time, a woman of 19 or 20 was expected to fully run a household and a gentlewoman was expected to handle many servants as well. Kira Knightly plays Elizabeth as a giggling airhead more at home at the main shopping drags of Paris, London and Los Angeles now than in 19th century British countryside. To add to the travesty we have Donald Sutherland playing Mr. Bennet not as a British eccentric but like an ex-hippie. It is as if Sutherland is channeling his character from Kelly's Heroes.As for other characters, Darcy is forgettable. One wonders why anyone would love him Judy Densch has too much bearing to play the foolish Lady Catherine. Finally, Mrs. Bennet is not the oaf that Jane Austen makes her to be.Having said all this, the main problem with this movie is that it is a ""Romantic"" movie in the true sense of the word, i.e., its heart and its values are those associated with the romantic movement of mid 19th century. However, Pride and Prejudice the book is decidedly ""unromantic"" and ""rationalistic."" While romanticism is based on rebellion against convention, Pride and Prejudice is rather a celebration of social convention. The people who would be romantic heroes in other novels, i.e., Wickham and Lydia are treated as fools and knaves. On the other hand Elizabeth and Jane, fall in love within the conventions of the day and are given full rewards and happy endings. This movie is contrary to that spirit."
"3343","Pride & Prejudice",2,"who hired the scriptwriters?","I have given this film a score of 2, one point due to the lovely scenery, the other for the actors who worked well enough with the script they were offered.Overall this film was a debacle. Perhaps it should have been called 'A film loosely based on a book by some woman of no great note' for all the credit the scriptwriters gave Jane Austen. Fans of Austen, save your money and watch the BBC version again (Firth etc). I believe it truly an insult to one of the greatest authors of history to dismember her story, words, settings and even delete all wit from one of the most perfect love stories, and observances of manner and class, of all time, Even the costuming is a disaster, the wigs awful, and where were half the characters? One begins to suspect they had a very small budget after paying Keira's fee, or perhaps it was all spent on hiring the rocks who really stole the show (even though Elizabeth and her relatives are supposed to be headed for the lakes district). I am so appalled by the 'movie machine' these days, and scriptwriters please get over yourselves. you will never ever compare to the true literary greats.To all those who have never heard of Jane Austen, you may well enjoy this film and go see it by all means.I am so, so sorely disappointed."
"3344","Pride & Prejudice",10,"Wonderful Moments, Both Big and Small","There's really nothing negative to say about the film. The actors are perfectly cast, the direction is subtle and well-realized, and even a shade more cinematic than I would have expected, or than it needed to be. The moment, early in the film, when Elizabeth and Mr. Darcy are arguing while dancing, and as they look at each other, everyone else in the room disappears... emotional, cinematic, and brilliant. Soft little touches like this, throughout the film, make it work far better than some dry BBC version of any Jane Austen book.Yes yes, I'm male, and I enjoy a good car chase and explosion as much as the next guy. Tragically, there was none of that in this movie, but I'll get over it. Ladies, you'll want to watch this movie over and over. And guys, trust me: Even if this movie isn't your ""thing,"" if you take your date to this one, you're in good shape.Ten of Ten, and that's after I saw the Bollywood ""Bride and Prejudice"" not too long ago. That one was fun, but this version had the emotional impact, camera-work and staging that seemed to do Ms. Austen the most justice. Wonderful moments both big and small."
"3345","Pride & Prejudice",9,"See it!","I saw this at the Toronto Inter. Film Festival. At first I thought, ""why yet another Pride and Prejudice?"" But I quickly changed my mind. Yes, the 1995 version was wonderful, and yes, you can develop characters a lot more in a miniseries. Let it go and judge this on its own terms.This version is set earlier--1797. As the director explained, he thought the Empire dresses too ugly and justified the earlier date because that was the date of the first draft of P&P. So it looks a bit different--more realistic, if you ask me. The Bennetts live in a real estate, with pigs and mud around. Chatsworth, which Jane Austen visited, fills in for Pemberley. With the exception of the ball scenes and a scene in town, very little of the epic period piece is needed.Keira makes a wonderful Elizabeth. She is the right age to be vivacious and silly, and she does a great job. Donald Sutherland as Mr Bennett!! At first the idea seems preposterous, but once again, it turns out well. Sutherland somehow masks his accent and blends in perfectly. His eccentricity is just enough to show where Elizabeth gets her spirit.The director and Matthew MacFadyen confessed at the screening that neither had seen the earlier versions before they filmed this, which perhaps explains why this is so successful--they weren't intimidated and weren't tied to earlier interpretations.If you have any doubts, see this yourself. You won't be sorry."
"3346","Pride & Prejudice",9,"PRIDE AND PREJUDICE...A Timeless Romantic Tale","Keira Knightley brings magic to the screen from the first frame of the film as she reads a book and slowly walks back to the brick home of the Bennet family while ducks waddle about and clothes flap in the wind. Thus setting up the romantic location of the beautiful English country side and the magnificence of the great English homes which create a visual background for PRIDE AND PREJUDICE and in the development of all the characters which follow.The cast is really superb, with Brenda Blethyn and Donald Sutherland in performances that cast the true essence of the Bennet mother and father and provide a strong contrast to the aristocracy represented by the always strong performance of Judy Dench.Matthew Macfadyen is a wonderful Mr. Darcy and the scenes with he and the lovely Keira Knightly build and build in the development of their romance with the scene between them in the rain under a colonnade truly one to remember and cherish.PRIDE AND PREJUDICE will stay with you forever, as the romance and the tale of the lovely Ms. Bennet and the handsome Mr. Darcy is timeless in its setting, dialog and romance."
"3347","Chhichhore",9,"I miss you Sushanth","I watched the movie after hearing news of suicide of Sushanth. I loved the movie. Each and every thing in the movie done fantastically.

I really shocked he was a rank holder and quit this studies for cinema. And also I can't believe you attempted suicide. You was a fighter..

Despite the weakness of the film, I love this Nitesh Tiwari directional. it's full of hilarious moments made us (audience) laught out loud. We will be invited to reminisce into college days like 3 Idiots with different atmosphere and themes, but with almost the same impact. I know, the transition of flashback scene was not seamless. Sometimes, it seemed out of control. But believe me, it'll be still on the right track till the end. The performances of lead cast was also just okay, not that great. It was the supporting cast who looked stunning in this film. But overall, the chemistry between casts was excellent. Go for this one!

The performances are just mind blowing, after so long Shraddha kapoor has got a chance to show what she is. Sushanth is wonderful in his role, and the film also touches few social topics and leaves you with a message.
The dialogues and college episodes are just mindblowing and it brings you laughs.
You laugh so much that you no more care about the world.
The director runs the screenplay of the past and the present simultaneously which is really fresh on the film.
The sports episodes are also picturised in a clean way instead of adding a cinematic feel into it.

"3363","Chhichhore",8,"It's time to shrug off the underdog tag!","Chhichhore - Indian films have now come of age, they can give a message subtly without being preachy. Chhichhore begins with young Raghav suffering from a massive anxiety about whether he will crack the all India engineering entrance exam as he has invested 18 hours a day for the past many months preparing for it and wants to match the caliber of his parents.A failure to launch throws him into despair and the occasion brings together six middle aged people into a reunion with the objective of alleviating Raghav from his pain and encouraging him to bring hope back into his fragile life. LOSERS, as these six were known as in their student life, recount their carefree journey initially and the final effort to shrug off the underdog tag, drawing a significant parallel to Raghav's situation.Director Nitesh Tiwari handles the subject with sensitivity and balances the Losers journey through the undergraduate years well. There was ample temptation available to propel this segment of the film into being an over the top and loud essay, but Tiwari never gives in, thus rising above the ordinary. Sushant Singh Rajput delivers an underrated performance and Tahir Raj Bhasin adds gravitas. Naveen Polishetty, Tushar Pandey and Saharsh Kumar Shukla add to the little masala with their individual contribution, but the star of the Losers union must be Varun Sharma. He is absolutely a laugh riot with his expressions, one liners and an incredible energy, cracking up the theatre on numerous occasions. The weakest link is yet again Shraddha Kapoor, who needs to experiment with diversity of histrionic capabilities and expressions.Don't miss Chhichhore, it's a fantastic mood lifter and easy on the mind, often drawing you into the proceedings."

There were tense moments involving human actions and emotions.
I loved the way parallelism has worked in the movie.
What I didn't like about the movie were some impractical elements and poor acting by some characters.
Nonetheless the movie is a great and must watch. If you have lived in a hostel or you have spent a lot of great times with your friends, you can find moments to relate yourself. The movie also teaches us about our expectations from life and from those who are around us, especially the kids. It keeps us entertained and engaged throughout the runtime.
Definitely one of the best movies of the decade.
Go watch it.."
"3367","Chhichhore",9,"Master Craft by director","IIT Bombay is Alma mater of director Nitesh Tiwari. I don't think anyone else could have done the justice with this film. He has blended his experience in IIT with the typical problem of dealing with failure and ensured that the audience leave theatre with euphoric feeling at the end. He has captured the essence of college life and mixed with a impactful message for young guns. Something a very few directors are capable of pulling this off.
This film brings back the memories of IIT. Though it was KGP for me.

"3372","Radioactive",5,"References to Hiroshima and Chernobyl spoiled it for me","Although the movie title is 'Radioactive' I though it was the story
about Marie Curie and I'm disappointed that so much included was not related to the research / achievements of Pierre and Marie Curie e.g. the atomic bomb dropped on Hiroshima and the Chernobyl disaster - neither of which are related to Polonium or Radium (which were discoveries of Marie Curie) The only thing they have in common is that they are 'Radioactive'."
"3373","Radioactive",6,"A bit of a letdown","Marie Curie became more prominent after her death especially around the early years this century, so a film about her life and achievements was a welcome view. There are a few changes in the facts, probably to make this move more dramatic, but perhaps the book from which this film derives, was written like that. The tough days in Marie Curie's life when she arrived in Paris is hardly touched, which undoubtedly lead to her stubborn attitude which is over characterized in this film. In real life she was not such a hard and difficult person."
"3374","Radioactive",6,"A distinct lack of PPE...","A distinct lack of PPE but it still wouldn't shield you from some pretty poor editing and a story condensed into 100 minutes about a great woman who deserves so much more but seems to get the blame for Hiroshima, Chernobyl as well as errant husbands."
"3375","Radioactive",6,"A bizarrely drab and amateurish retelling of an incredible story","For a historical figure with an impact as significant as Marie Curie, this is a really underwhelming biopic. Stale, rushed and lacking any insightful emotional depth, Radioactive is a dull watch throughout, failing in its attempt to capture both the significance of Curie's discoveries and her own personal struggles.It's so strange how poor this film is, given the immense talent behind it. On screen, Rosamund Pike and Sam Riley star, while Persepolis director Marjane Satrapi helms the film. Yet despite that talent, Radioactive feels almost amateurish at its worst.Its screenplay is poor throughout, from its lack of dramatic insight to its consistently terrible dialogue. The early moments of the film are insufferable, chronicling Marie's meeting with future husband Pierre through scenes of awkward and forced scientific flirting.Later on, Radioactive tries to grab your attention with its assessment of the standing of women in the scientific community, but does little to make that theme really get under your skin. In fact, the most memorable part of that theme is Curie's repeated assertions that it was not her gender that stood most in her way as a scientist at the time, but her background and funds.And with relatively little focus on her background, there isn't much of an inspiring, uplifting arc for Curie here. Instead, there are a few eureka moments interspersed by long, dry and dull periods with barely any memorable drama to show.Even stranger is the way in which the film tries to represent the long-term, controversial effects of Curie's discovery of radioactivity. Almost randomly, the film throws in bizarre vignettes from the future showing the uses of the discovery for good and bad, including the bombing of Hiroshima and the development of nuclear weapons.That all but ruins any narrative flow in the film, only reinforcing the fact that Radioactive really is a bit of an amateurish work. Marjane Satrapi's generally unappealing style and drab direction do little to keep you engaged, while even leads like Sam Riley and to an extent Rosamund Pike are below their best.It's a real shame, because it's clear that Marie Curie's is a great story, and with so much talent working in this film, you would expect a whole lot more from Radioactive. But, as a painfully dull, stale and even amateurish biopic, there's little positive to say about it."
"3376","Radioactive",7,"Pike's Peak in Uneven Biopic","Rosamund Pike has a penchant for playing determined women navigating oppressive male-dominated environments, from the femme fatale of ""Gone Girl"" to war photographer Marie Colvin in last year's ""A Private War."" In the latest example, ""Radioactive,"" Pike delivers a powerful embodiment of another tragic hero named Marie. As pioneering physicist and chemist Marie Curie, Pike delivers a dazzling performance rich with the struggles of a life defined by perilous discoveries and great personal loss. As directed by Marjane Satrapi, this discursive biopic struggles whenever it cuts away from her drama to explore the bigger picture - with peculiar flash-forwards to a nuclear future - but Pike helps fuse it together. Unfortunately, the movie's unorthodox structure stumbles when it veers off on heavy-handed tangents to explain the reverberations of the Curies' research. Pike remains a compelling figure into old age. Anyone unfamiliar with the Curie family legacy will certainly find much to appreciate about their various accomplishments under incredible personal duress and tremendous social upheaval. So overall, this is a gud moovie."
"3377","Radioactive",6,"doesn't quite capture the impact","Greetings again from the darkness. There can never be enough movies made or books written about remarkable people with incredible accomplishments. Marie Curie was certainly a remarkable woman and her accomplishments were such scientific break-throughs that we are still using them today. Director Marjane Satrapi's (Oscar nominated for PERSEPOLIS, 2007) film is based on the 2010 book ""Radioactive: Marie & Pierre Curie: A Tale of Love and Fallout"" by Lauren Redniss, and the screenplay was adapted by Jack Thorne (THE AERONAUTS, 2019).The film opens in 1934 Paris, and we see an enfeebled Marie Curie (Rosamund Pike) collapse and get rushed to hospital - a sequence used by director Satrapi as a framing device. The film quickly flashes back to 1893 when a headstrong and brilliant twenty-something Marie Salomea Sklodowska gets kicked out of her laboratory for being ... well ... a bit too headstrong for the times. Soon she meets an equally headstrong and also brilliant scientist named Pierre Curie (Sam Riley). Pierre recognizes the potential if they combine forces, while Marie initially demands her independence, having never found another scientist worthy of the efforts required for collaboration.The initial flirtations between brainy scientists is as clumsy and awkward as one might expect. In general, the film struggles with how to best address Curie's personal life with her professional life and the challenges she faced as a brilliant woman in an era when male scientists didn't much appreciate a woman scientist telling them they have ""misunderstood the atom"", as she and her husband announce the discovery of not one, but two new elements: radium and polonium. Romance and science and equality are a lot for one film to tackle, and this one flounders a bit.As the film and science progress, director Satrapi intersperses flash-forward vignettes to show how Curie's discovery of radioactivity is used in the future for both good and not so good. These dropped-in segments include cancer treatment for a little boy in 1957, the Enola Gay bombing Hiroshima in 1945, the Atomic Bomb test in 1961 Nevada, and of course, the 1986 Chernobyl disaster. The segments aren't always a smooth transition from Curie's story, but they make the point of how scientists don't always have control over how their discoveries are applied. There is even a scene where Pierre shows Marie some comical uses entrepreneurs found of trying to capitalize on their discovery, and how their work might factor in to everyday life.As a biography or profile of Marie Curie's life and accomplishments, the film hits the high notes, though we do wish it dug a bit deeper. The gender prejudices of the times are somewhat underplayed, and even Marie herself claims lack of funds and the fact that she wasn't a natural born Parisian held her back more than the roadblocks she faced as a female scientist. It would seem reasonable that those issues were likely tied together and should not be separated. She lashes out at Pierre regarding the Nobel committee initially keeping her name off the submission, but of course this anger is misplaced, as Pierre demanded she be included.The historical aspect of her winning two Nobel Prizes is not treated as the astonishing accomplishment it is, but time is spent on a personal scandal that occurred after Pierre's death. We do see Marie sleeping with a sample of her radioactive uranium, and watch her slow physical deterioration, including an incessant cough and damaged skin. Late in the film, Anya Taylor-Joy plays her daughter Irene, and we see the two of them head onto the battlefield to provide mobile x-ray devices for injured soldiers. The Curie family tree is filled with renowned scientists (Irene and her husband Frederick jointly won the Nobel Prize in 1935 for artificial radioactivity), and some of these discoveries literally changed the world - including cancer treatments. Perhaps it's unrealistic to expect any movie to capture the historical importance of Marie Curie, but we are somehow left feeling she deserved better."
"3378","Radioactive",5,"The wikipedia page about Dr. Curie is way more exciting","This movie is a pale and shallow effort to represent an extraordinary person with a remarkable life. Marie Curie is an absolute icon one of the most important scientists that ever existed and for sure the most important female scientist. Madamme Curie had a life full of challenges and she fought bravely to overcome barriers in the name of science. Her passion, her brilliance and her character changed the world in more than one way. She opened the way for women in science. She was the first female professor in the University of Paris. She was a poor immigrant, who had to work her way to the top. She was open about love, she was brave and humble and honest. She donated most of her Nobel money.
Did we get that in the movie? Maybe 1% of it. The vision of the director about one of the greatest minds of all time is ""Sheldon Cooper in a dress"". There was some effort to suggest how her discoveries changed the world, but it did not succeed to present the scope and the greatest importance of her work.This is not a bad movie, actually it is perfectly watchable. Actors are great and the love story between Marie and Pier is adorable. But given the fact that they had such an amazing life, I think the movie is a missed chance.Still better love story than Twilight though"
"3379","Radioactive",9,"Prime and everyone Associated with this Movie","Deserve a A+. I'm not cool like all the dudes who gave it a 2 or 3 but I do enjoy a well made movie that educates me, which is exactly what Radioactive did. Thank you Prime. Keep up the good work. You are giving all the cool people something to turn up their noses at and entertaining Neanderthals like me at the same time. This is something to be proud of."
"3380","Radioactive",2,"A terrible movie as bad as 2018's Entebbe","For anyone who might not know, the 2018 movie Entebbe is supposed to be about Israeli special forces rescuing the passengers of a hijacked airliner. The actual raid, the supposed topic of the movie, is only depicted for about 5 total minutes in the film. Even worse, scenes of the raid are interspersed with some scenes of a completely unrelated musical-art stage production. What the ....? Radioactive has the same pointless artsy angle. Instead of simply depicting Curie's tumultuous life, the film mixes in scenes of a completely unrelated dancer on a stage and other pointless bits.
Radioactive is a postmodern biopic that doesn't focus on telling the story of its subject's life, like a comedy special with no jokes."
"3381","Radioactive",7,"Secrets in the science","This film is of the life of Maria Sklodowska or as we better know her Marie Curie. Maria was a Polish scientist who had come to Paris in 1891 to continue with her studies.
The film starts at the end, now i know that sounds like a weird place to begin, but as you will see one of the first scenes are of Marie Curie (Played by Rosamund Pike) collapsing in her laboratory in 1934. As the scene progresses, Marie is seen being taken on a hospital trolley down a corridor, this is where she begins her flashback to how her wondrous life had played out. At this point i will say that you will come to realise that Marie, is scared/afraid of hospitals, of which you will see why. So we are back in 1893 in Paris, Marie (A name she took to be more ""French"" and be accepted) literally bumps into Pierre Curie (played by Sam Riley). Marie in her seemingly abrupt manner dismisses Pierre's interest in her work and promptly continues on her way to see Professor Lippmann (played by Simon Russell Beale). Professor Lippmann has a laboratory that Marie is using part of for her studies, but this meeting was to bring the end to this arrangement.
As the only woman among a group of 23 scientists in the department, Marie now faces the challenge of finding a new work space. As she hasn't the funds to set up her own, she has to see if anyone will give her the space and a chance. She is turned down by many, she believes that this is because she is Polish or a woman, or both. Then her break comes when she bumps into Pierre once again, this time not so literally. As Pierre has also seemingly been overlooked by the establishment, he offers Marie a space in his Laboratory. He is very aware of her work and has read her papers.
The story that we then know of Marie's great work is then portrayed in a very well produced drama, with the added bit of romance and tragedy."

"3384","Radioactive",8,"An interesting biopic","Radioactive is a solid movie with some interesting screenplay decisions and directing. Overall it's effective at getting MME Curie's motivations, ambitions, and accomplisments across. Thorne and Satrapi provided an interesting take with mixing modern applications related to radioactive decay and uses both for good and war.I thought Rosamund's performance was excellent and Riley's as Pierre was also good.As a bonus, teachers have access to a guide that goes into her work and chemistry more on the movie page seperate from the movie."
"3385","Radioactive",5,"Hazardous Waste","GRADE: CTHIS FILM IS MILDLY RECOMMENDED.IN BRIEF: Too many artsy surreal images sabotage this earnest bio-pix about Marie Curie.JIM'S REVIEW: Radioactive, the film biography of Marie Curie, is a film at odds with itself. The film is bi-polar in its approach as it tries to convey Marie Curie's life story with its artful visions of atomic mass destruction. The two storylines don't mesh particularly well.Demanding and head-strong, Marie Curie, the famous Polish scientist (sans accent) who would go on to win two Nobel Prizes for scientific research with the discoveries of radium and polonium, finally earns her own biography. Unfortunately, her greatness follows the standard formula of conventional storytelling: a stereotypical crusader overcoming obstacles of sexism and societal mores to achieve her dreams. Despite being a fine-looking period piece, the movie is too formulaic in its quaintness and contrivances about science, love, and hardships that never amounts to much. It's a 20th Century CliffNotes version of a great life lost within the artistic vision of a talented 21st Century filmmaker.Director Marjane Satrapi interjects her history lesson with flashbacks and forwards that show glimpses of her innovative visual style. She makes Marie Curie into a modern-day feminist and progressive thinker and Pierre as a kind and understanding spouse. However, their relationship comes off stilted and far too bohemian. So many scenes seem too rom/com...from their first ""meet cute"" chance meeting on the streets of Paris which brings the two scientists together to their romantic skinny-dipping and bedroom love-making sessions. In between, we do find the time to see their dedication to scientific research and lab experiments, but it comes off as a mere afterthought.The filmmaker nurtures the Curies as a fun-loving couple who are oblivious to the dangers of their discoveries and its radioactive fallout upon them and others. The overt hints of the Curies' health issues In dealing with their dangerous chemical substances becomes a series of discussions punctuated with ominous coughing jags. While this fact may be accurately portrayed, the far-reaching effect is mind-numbing and, at times, laughable, as they verbally weigh the pros and cons of their scientific discoveries.Their philosophic debates become the filmmaker's folly. As the film progresses, its non-linear structure and the director's continued use of heavy-handed imagery overstates the Curies' dilemma. The film suddenly forsakes its historical accuracies and becomes a protest warning against nuclear energy. This decision to mesh the past with the future is the central flaw with the film and it is all the more jarring in the movie's episodic handling of global events that have yet to unfold. Odd transitions show strange microscopic sub-atomic CGI particles floating around and mixed-up time sequences that depict the yet-to-happen bombing of Hiroshima and close-ups of A-bomb testIng experiments. This leads moviegoers to the 1986 Chernobyl disaster, although Ms. Curie died in 1936, fifty years prior to that tragedy. These inappropriate images, while effectively shot, becomes intrusive and unnecessary plot devices as these scenes overtakes Marie Curie's personal story. (Despite Ms. Satrapi's strong political pontificating about the harmful effects of nuclear energy, she surprisingly downplays the positive use of radiation via x-rays and medical breakthroughs in cancer research that stem from the Curies' scientific research.)The film is chocked full of anachronistic transitional segues that juxtapose ""then and now"" moments which intrude upon the early 20th century period time frame, veering the film into the surreal. (Just one such example: Marie is walking the atmospheric cobblestone streets of Paris when suddenly a Russian 80's fire engine speeds past her on its way to a nuclear meltdown emergency. WTF? I jotted down in my notes.) The movie exasperates rather than enlightens its subject as it grows ""curiouser and Curie-ouser"" away from its initial biographical narrative...and not in a good way.As Marie Curie, Rosalind Pike has some strong scenes, but as written, the screenplay by Jack Thorne, never makes her character truly convincing. It doesn't help matters that the director's artsy touches don't fit with the period trappings of the early 1900's and this undercut her fine performance. Sam Riley is good as Marie's one-dimensional beleaguered and protective husband Pierre. He coughs with distinction. Fine support is provided by Aneurin Barnard as Marie's younger married lover and Anya Taylor-Joy as Marie's daughter, Irene. Special mention must go to cinematographer Anthony Dod Mantle for his accomplished lensing.Ms. Satrapi's film is a noble but very flawed attempt at honoring this great scientist. The director's creative energy is far from inert, but it overpowers the basic storytelling. All of the artsy surface treatment implodes Radioactive and its powerful effect is barely detected or emotionally felt in this lukewarm drama."
"3386","Radioactive",2,"Politicized, sensationalized nonsense !","Mostly a soap! So much has no historical validation and so out of sync with the values of the time and unlkel"
"3387","Radioactive",6,"A better movie than the French one but...","The film portrays Marie as the lead in the radium and studies on radioactivity. It commits the same sexism it wants to portray in men. It really diminishes the teamwork. Pierre Curie fought for his wife to be recognized for her equal contribution.
Acting is brilliant"
"3388","Radioactive",6,"Not as terrible as some people are saying","IN A NUTSHELL:
Directed by Marjane Satrapi, this drama features the true story of Nobel prize-winning Marie Sklodowska Curie (1867 - 1934). In addition to her incredible contributions to physics and chemistry, she's the only one in history to win 2 Novel prizes. The movie is based on the graphic novel Radioactive: Marie & Pierre Curie: A Tale of Love and Fallout by Lauren Redniss with the screenplay written by Jack Thorne.It was supposed to debut on International Women's Day but, like everything else this worldwide pandemic has touched, the release was postponed until now on Amazon Prime this week.TIPS FOR PARENTS:
There is a split second when you see two make people run and jump into a lake. Yes, you see skin and other things. That surprised me for a PG-13 movie. Why? It wasn't needed to move the story forward.
You see a married couple tossing around in bed briefly with some skin showing.
An unmarried couple is seen in bed, but you don't see any ""action.""
Infidelity and talk of ""intimate"" relationsTHEMES:
""The things that make us weak are the things that make us strong."" - Marie Curie
Persistence, determination
Equal rights for women
The quest for knowledge
Choice and consequence
Humanity
Love. Love of science and romantic love.
Humility in the face of innovation and invention
Whether mankind is ready for the benefits of nature or whether it will do harm
The double standard for men and womenTHINGS I LIKED:
I love Rosamund Pike in everything she does. I love that she's fascinated with the element radium that ""doesn't behave as it should"", just like her. You'll learn so many things about her and her story needs to be told. While Marie Curie's inventions brought humanity life-saving applications, I thought it was interesting that the film also pointed out the negative consequences.
Sam Riley plays Pierre Curie
If you ever watched The Big Bang Theory: The Complete Series (Limited Edition Blu-ray + Digital), you might have already learned a thing or two about some of these scientific elements.
The movie starts out showing off its agifying magic on Rosamund Pike by displaying an old, dying Marie Curie who reflects back on her life.
It's helpful to have a character who doesn't understand science so that Marie and Pierre can teach her and us at the same time.
My university students have been writing essays this week about which counts more: hard work or talent. I think this movie answers the debate. While brilliant, Marie Curie still had to work extremely hard to achieve her goals.
There is an interesting scene where Pierre and Marie argue about whether or not religion can be considered. Pierre points out that you can't see reactivity, yet it's real. Marie dismisses the idea, which is odd since scientists should be open to all possibilities in the search of truth.
There are some scenes that show future events and consequences of her discoveries. In most cases, they are powerful, albeit forced. She worried that her work would hurt people, but someone told her that it was her job to bring light to the world and to not worry about the ripples.THINGS I DIDN'T LIKE:
The filming itself feels a bit clumsy.
The director tries to get creative with an artsy-fartsy dream sequence, but it doesn't quite work.
I have no idea what Marie Curie was like in real life, but it always annoys me when movies portray brilliant people as stubborn and rude.
I wish more time had spent on the good things that Marie Curie's discoveries accomplished, like the X-ray machine and cancer treatments, rather than on just the deadly bombs that would destroy life.
Some of the music was just odd and distracting.
All of the characters seem to age except Professor Lippmann (Simon Russell Beale).
The color palette is very grey in the 1800s, which is appropriate, but it felt like things should have lightened up in the 1900s.

"3391","Radioactive",8,"Great performances with the lead in this fast moving biography film of Marie Curie.","Radioactive (4 out of 5 stars).Radioactive is a good biographical drama film about Marie Curie (Rosamund Pike) and Pierre (Sam Riley) teaming together to coming out with a breakthrough on a new element. Creating radioactivity. The breakthrough takes science into a whole new direction with medical technology. Or weaponry.The plot is good. I also liked how the movie shows Marie Curie trying to do things on her own. Being one of the first woman in science and trying to do things her own way. Which Pierre understood her way of thinking. I also liked how the movie refers to a flash foward when Pierre or Marie giving a lecture about there research while flash fowarding to an event like WWII Hiroshima bombing or Nevadas nuclear bomb testing site. And than the Chernobyl incident. That while creating something helpful in the medical field can also have a downfall with being used as a weapon.Rosamund Pike and Sam Riley did great with there characters. Anya Taylor Joy also did a good job playing there young adult daughter.The music score is good. Its a relaxing electronical kind of feel. The direction is a little fast moving with its pace. Going from brief moments of Marie and Pierre love life. To discovering an element. To the characters suffering from an illness.I did feel like the films final moments with Maries illness coming to her and her moments of flashing with what her breakthrough has become. Did feel a little faulty with the script and weak third act. Otherwise, it is a good biographical film that is worth checking out about the events of Marie Curie."
"3392","Radioactive",10,"Ten for the efforts","Agreed this movie could have been much better. But by no means it is below per. Kudos to the production house for making this movie in spite of knowing that the target audience will be limited to those having science background. Full marks for a great effort towards bringing the life of a scientist onscreen. Highly recommended watch."
"3393","Radioactive",7,"Interesting and very thought provoking","Very interesting. Some artistic license with presenting personal thoughts but a great overview of Marie Curie and her husband's work."
"3394","Radioactive",2,"CGI mess","I had good expectations before starting this film when I read Rosamund Pike and Anya Taylor-Joy were in it. All of the actors were good, including the children. My problem with this film were with the choices the film director and writers made. Some choices were good as the settings and locations were well done, but others were a total mess of unnecessary CGI that honestly felt amateurish.Like a new photographer who discovers Photoshop and over edits his or her's pictures making them gaudy, there are many scenes with over-saturated colors and fake CGI bokeh that really are distracting. I lost it when the closeup of Marie's last kiss to her deceased husband was CGI. Why?The dialog and acting is so wooden, dry and stiff that I could not stand Marie Curie's character. Aren't we suppose to love the main character? Was the real Marie Curie this stiff and unlikable? I hope not. Why are we consistently reminded she is a first female scientist? Stop with the WAman dialog. I choose to watch the film because I knew who she was from textbooks. No need to scrap her gender across my face like low grit sandpaper. Why not just leave the gender adjective out and call her a great scientist, period? I found Pierre Curie, her husband, to me a far more likable character who help make a great couple great..Then there are the abrupt cuts and flashbacks. Some of the flashback scenes are not even related to Marie Curie's work. Geeze, stick to telling the woman's story clearly so that non-scientist can understand the significance of who she was without the annoying harsh film cuts. Again, as a filmmaker, it looks amateurish. It felt like somehow I sat on top of my TV remote and kept accidentally pushing the forward button because there are little in gradual transitions between scenes.I don't think I came with a better understanding of Marie Curie after watching this film. Again, the actors are phenomenal and I don't blame them one bit. My problem with this film is how the story was told and the directing style. Perhaps the History or Discovery channel has a better documentary."
"3395","Radioactive",4,"Disappointing","This attempt to tell the complex story of Marie Curie was nothing more than a directorial vanity piece. Worse yet, its combined focused on her sex life and the terrors-to-come of radiation made it feel as if she was/is solely responsible for millions of deaths from nuclear bombs, disasters and accidents.I did not like this story line. We needed to see far more about HER life, e.g. the circumstances that brought her to France from Poland, or more insight into her struggles, as a woman, to actually conduct her science.The film itself was atmospheric but so much of it was wasted on NOT advancing her story.Sad effort. Just sad."
"3396","Radioactive",5,"Radioactive could have benefited from a little more science...","If you enjoy reading my Spoiler-Free reviews, please follow my blog :)So, a little bit about me first: I was always a man of science. I have a Masters degree in Electronics and Telecommunications Engineering, and I was always fascinated by how things truly work. On the other hand, I'm not the biggest fan of biographical movies due to the genre's boundaries. These films often follow a generic script, filled with formulaic plot points and lacking imaginative storytelling. Therefore, I usually analyze these movies based on a single question: ""do I know more about the character and/or the story that made him/her famous now that I've watched this flick?"" Another aspect that's important in any film, but even more in this genre: the actor who interprets the protagonist.Radioactive possesses Rosamund Pike as the magnificent Marie Curie. If there's one undeniably incredible element in this feature, it's Pike's brilliant performance as the famous scientist. Now, I have no idea how Marie was as a person, so I can't really evaluate Pike's display regarding how accurate she is on a personal level. Nevertheless, her impressive emotional range can easily get her a few nominations when the awards season comes around. When it comes to which expressions to use or how strong her emotions need to be, Pike manages to always choose the most coherent option having in mind the character she portrays.Sam Riley shares great chemistry with Pike, delivering a couple of genuinely passionate moments and witty conversations. Anya Taylor-Joy (Irène Curie), who I forgot was also in the movie, is always a delight to see on screen and, in this case, a very welcome surprise. However, this film is so focused on its protagonist (as it should be), that every character and actor other than the main one ends up being utterly forgettable (nothing wrong with this). Technically, I need to praise the makeup artists, who did a terrific job getting Pike older throughout the runtime, as time flows accordingly. Evgueni and Sacha Galperine's score is simple yet sweet enough to slightly elevate a few sequences.Unfortunately, Radioactive holds more than just a few minor issues. My biggest gripe is related to how everything is put together. I doubt most people will watch this movie with the hope of seeing more of Marie Curie's personal relationships. This isn't exactly a romantic drama. Having in mind the discoveries that she made, I was extremely interested in watching how, in fact, she discovered radioactivity. Of course, I'm not expecting the film to turn into a highly detailed chemistry lesson and all of its specifics. But Marjane Satrapi rushes through most of the relevant moments or skips them entirely. Marie's first groundbreaking result is so casually presented to the viewer that it makes the whole thing far from being a big deal (which it is).There are a couple of visually captivating animated sequences that sort of explain the process that the characters are going to perform, but it's still quite underwhelming and disappointing. I still have dozens of questions now, which I hoped the movie would answer but didn't. It's also edited (Stéphane Roche) in such an uneasy manner that it feels like I'm watching two completely different films. I don't know if this was Satrapi or Jack Thorne's (screenwriter) idea, but showing (mostly adverse) future events directly related to Marie's discoveries didn't work for me at all. You know how these movies tend to have some sort of information shown before credits explaining how things worked out in real-life? It's like they picked them up and randomly spread them across the film.The focus went full-on to the protagonist's personal life instead of balancing it with her world-changing experiments. Answering my question above, I did learn more about Marie Curie, but not about what I wished to know about her. Ultimately, it feels like this biographical work doesn't honor her legacy. Just as an example, the story brushes over her discoveries so fast that it doesn't even explain the reasons behind the nomenclature of the new elements. Overall, it's not worthy of being the biography of the scientist's life.Radioactive boasts an absolutely outstanding Rosamund Pike as the great Marie Curie, but Marjane Satrapi (director), Jack Thorne (screenwriter), and Stéphane Roche (film editor) fail to deliver a well-structured narrative, rushing through the scientist's groundbreaking discoveries and experiments or ignoring them altogether. Randomly mixing up future catastrophes with the actual story not only breaks both the tone and pacing of the movie, but it also makes the whole viewing a bit uneasy. Despite her personal life always being a point of interest, her work and how she performed it are why most people want to watch this film. To learn more about her contributions to the world of today. Unfortunately, Curie's legacy is remitted to a by-the-numbers biographical work, restricted by the genre's formulaic tropes. A neat score by the Galperine brothers and a couple of visually captivating animated sequences still elevate an overall disappointing feature...Rating: C+"
"3397","The Dark Knight",10,"The Dark Knight","Confidently directed, dark, brooding, and packed with impressive action sequences and a complex story, The Dark Knight includes a career-defining turn from Heath Ledger as well as other Oscar worthy performances, TDK remains not only the best Batman movie, but comic book movie ever created."
"3398","The Dark Knight",10,"Film surpasses the hype","We've been subjected to enormous amounts of hype and marketing for the Dark Knight. We've seen Joker scavenger hunts and one of the largest viral campaigns in advertising history and it culminates with the actual release of the movie.Everything that's been said is pretty much spot on. This is the first time I can remember where a summer blockbuster film far surpasses the hype.For as much action as there is in this movie, it's the acting that makes it a great piece of work. Between all the punches, explosions and stunt-work is some great dialog work. All the actors have their moments.Bale's Batman is the definitive Batman because we see everything in this character finally on film. Martial arts skills, cunning, great tactical thinking, forensic application, technological genius to advance or improve Luscious Fox's inventions/technological breakthroughs, intimidating personality, and even a little swashbuckling. As for Heath, yes he gets credit for his performance as the Joker. But you have to also recognize Jonathan and Chris Nolan for the writing and treatment of the character. It's not just the fact that Ledger makes the Joker so menacing, but the Nolans have given the character this great manifesto that drives its actions. The Joker's stance on chaos, order, anarchy, the morality of the average modern human being make the character so interesting psychologically. The Nolans drafted a complex character and only a perfect performance could've pulled something like this off. That's how difficult of a role this was, and that's why Ledger's performance is so great.This isn't an action movie. It's a film that explores literary themes of the hero and villain, as well as order and anarchy. Yes, listen to the dialog because it's all in there."
"3399","The Dark Knight",9,"Superhero Genre - Alive and kicking","First I'd controversially like to point out that this movie wouldn't have gotten as much hype as it did if it wasn't for Heath Ledger's death before the release and the Academy not being afraid to give an Oscar to a corpse.Nevertheless, his performance is easily the best one in the superhero genre and the crafty, well put together New York accent confirms he put a lot of dedication and effort into his methodical role and deserved what he got (an Oscar). This isn't just another Batman movie anymore. Yes, there is action, explosions and stunt work but between that is masterfully crafted dialogue that dwells deep.Batman is his definitive self now, we finally see the fullest of his character and Christian Bale does him justice. Christopher Nolan praised be created complex characters and given each one justifiable treatment. That's the reason the cast works, everyone holds their own, there are no lazily written or neglected characters.With beautiful cinematography and presentation of Gotham, the visuals and the endeavours cast The Dark Knight is a film that easily gets on top of every superhero list and is certainly one to remember... remember for a long time.Final Grade: 9/10"
"3400","The Dark Knight",10,"Heath Ledger's Dark and Brilliant Swan Song","I couldn't believe ""The Dark knight"" could live up to the hype. That's perhaps the biggest surprise. The secret, I believe, is a stunning, mature, intelligent script. That makes it the best superhero movie ever made. As if that wasn't enough, Heath Ledger. He, the newest of the tragic modern icons present us with a preview of something we'll never see. A fearless, extraordinary actor capable to fill up with humanity even the most grotesque of villains. His performance is a master class. Fortunately, Christian Bale's Batman is almost a supporting character. Bale is good but there is something around his mouth that stops him from being great. ""The Dark Knight"" is visually stunning, powerful and moving. What else could anyone want."
"3401","The Dark Knight",10,"MASTERPIECE","It is just what you want for the best movie. Great story great acting, thrilling twist.
Just watched Joker in 2019, I just has to come back and give dark knight a 10. And thanks to Heath Ledger for the exceptional performs."
"3402","The Dark Knight",10,"Fantastic!","Im just gonna start off by saying I LOVE this movie.Its one of my favorites of all time. I honestly cant think of too much wrong with this movie other than its a little long and Batmans by now infamous voice. But everything else is top notch. The acting,story,atmosphere,and actions scenes are all amazing. If you haven't seen this movie see it right now! I went into this not expecting to much but I came out blown away, I cant imagine any movie being much better. I'll just have to wait for The Dark Knight Rises to release to see if anything can be better. Until then, this stands as the best movie I've ever seen"
"3403","The Dark Knight",10,"One of the Best Superhero movies EVER!!!!!!!","I saw the dark knight about three years ago when I was in the 8th grade. And I was blown away at how beautifully done it was, the camera work, the acting, the story, it all took me by surprise. It is to this day one of the best movies I have ever seen or will see. No other movie can impact you in such an intense way than The Dark Knight. It is a movie worth seeing due to the fact that the workers put so much time and effort into this one film and they did not want to waste money putting up garbage. So Christopher Nolan, thank you for not wasting our time, instead earning our time with this film. To this day I still am anxious to see the movie at home. I recommend it to anyone who likes action movies in general. To anyone who doesn't, don't waste your time write bad reviews about this film."
"3404","The Dark Knight",9,"A Batman Of Shakesperean Proportions","Dark, yes, complex, ambitious. Christopher Nolan and his co-writer Jonathan Nolan deserve a standing ovation. I don't usually go for loud movies filled with mindless gore and violence. ""The Dark Knight"" is certainly loud and violent but it's not mindless. It has depth and soul. Even the Joker, in an extraordinary creation by Heath Ledger, is deeply human. The natural petulance of Christian Bale makes his ego and alter ego the most fascinating and complex of all film superheroes. Part of the genius of this movie is that Batman himself, in screen time, is not really the lead. My attention was captivated by Heath Ledger and he determines and inspires the breathtaking atmosphere that envelopes Gotham as well as us. The aplomb of Christopher Nolan as a director is mind blowing and his secret, I believe, is his obvious respect for his audience. What he's done is to elevate a popular genre into Shakesperean proportions. Bravo!"
"3405","The Dark Knight",NA,"The Most Realistic True to Heart Movie Based on Comic Books.","A brilliant tense movie from the beginning to the end in which tells the story of the rising new menace in Gotham city known only as the Joker and how the Dark Knight has to reach his limits trying to control the havoc he breaks in Gotham city.The movie is an extraordinary piece of the filmmaking art in all its aspects, the plot is carefully and smartly written as a intricately wrought canvas, the character development is very satisfying, the movie was shot well and nicely directed, the epic score fits the scenes and add up to the whole visual experience, the acting was intense by all cast where each fit their role perfectly, specially Heath Ledger who managed after all these years of having the Joker around in comic books, animations, TV series and even movies to literally bring this complicated character with all its twisted, brilliant, sadistic, dark and sometimes funny personality to live on the big screen. This is the last movie that Heath Ledger filmed completely and I believe some how he saved the best for last as he managed to put an outstanding final act of a realistic Joker and managed to put a smile on our faces before death brings down the curtains on his talent."
"3406","The Dark Knight",10,"Surpasses ""Begins"" in every aspect!!!","Christopher Nolan's second bundle of joy ""The Dark Knight"" EXCEEDED all  of my expectations!!! With the success of 2005's reboot of the Batman  franchise, they took what was already established and expanded it,  amped it up, and gave a deeper, darker and brooding story that is more  gripping and the suspense is likely to catch you of guard several times  throughout. Christian Bale delves more deeper into Batman, sworn to  fight evil and injustice, though also quite reluctant and uncertain if  his crusade can ever end and cleanse his inner turmoil from his  fractured soul due to the murder of his beloved parents. But with the  help of his trusted butler/ally Alfred (played superbly by Michael  Cane) grounds him, gives him moral support, and keeps him in check. But  the real star of the show is Heath Ledger as Batman's most deadly  enemy, The Joker. I can HONESTLY tell you that: as good as Jack  Nicholson was in Batman'89 he is CHILD'S PLAY compared to this Joker.  He is sadistic, psychotic, and downright SCARIER and PSYCHOLOGICALLY  disturbing than the previous incarnation of The Clown Prince of Crime  and Ledger gives it his all to do him justice. Along with the original  cast comes some fresh faces such as Aaron Eckhart, Maggie Gyllenhaal  and more. I must say though I liked Katie Holmes, Gyllenhaal gives a  much better performance and is a far cry from the ""damsel-in-distress""  stereotype (though there's a little of it, THANKFULLY) that's common in  films. Bale and Gyllenhall have MUCH better chemistry this time around  more so than Holmes. Even better, the fight sequences are vastly  improved and feature more brutal and bone crushing combat than ""Begins""  in addition to new technology at Batman's disposal.  Also worth mentioning is screenwriter Jonathan Nolan, who gives the  film an added frosting to an already delicious cake.  Simply put, The Dark Knight is totally more bad ass than ""Begins."" The  action is great, and the plot is more deeper and engrossing. I applaud  Christopher Nolan, Christian Bale, and especially Heath Ledger (who  sadly passed away earlier this year) and all those aboard for believing  in Mr. Nolan's talents for this second installment. Although some may  feel a bit of melancholy over Ledger's death, but as a final note I  will say this sincerely from my heart: Remember Heath Ledger and honor  him in your minds and hearts not only for his performances, but as a  human being and father to his daughter Matilda  Ledger. May we issue him best wishes for his family and friends and his  daughter for years to come. Remember . . . Honor him not only for this  role and past roles, but as an incredible individual and talented  actor.  Rest in peace. Heath Ledger: 4/4/1979-1/22/2008."
"3407","The Dark Knight",10,"The sequel we deserved to the Batman we wanted","I used to leave a theatre after seeing a highly anticipated movie, specifically a sequel, and be so revved up about what I saw that I would declare that movie to be the best of a series. After each of the prequel ""Star Wars"" films, I rated that one the best, as good as any of the originals...for a time, until my opinion balanced out and I had a more well-rounded take. For that reason, I steer away from that mindset, and did for ""Dark Knight"".Though my opinion is solidifying already after having seen a Warner Bros. screening last night, ""Dark Knight"" ably stands on its own with or without ""Batman Begins"". At a two and a half hour runtime, it's definitely an epic of a movie, but one that never runs out of gas. A delightful addition to this experience was a healthy amount of IMAX footage, which significantly adds to the feel of being on a personal, and gruesome, tour of Gotham City.Christian Bale plays such a well rounded Batman and Bruce Wayne, qualities that none of those who have donned the cowl before him have pulled off. I still have to remember that Bale is British since he speaks with such a spot on American accent. Bale has a particular slurring lisp that serves him quite well, charmingly for Bruce Wayne and threateningly for Batman.Countering him is the late Heath Ledger, who plays such a scary and creepy Joker that I found it impossible to NOT have chills half the time I saw him on screen. What really separates this brand of Joker from Jack Nicholson's portrayal is true unpredictability. It's obvious that, to be a good guy and think like the Joker, it really takes a toll, and it sure isn't easy. How exactly does one take him down when he's woven his harebrained plot around multiple hostages, explosives, or disappearing parlor tricks?Initially, I was uneasy about how the character of Harvey Dent would be handled. In my mind, there was really only one faithful portrayal of him, and that could be found in the ""Batman"" animated series of the early 90s. As well as Tommy Lee Jones COULD have handled him in ""Batman Forever"", he certainly did not, though it still was a highlight of that movie. Aaron Eckhart ably assumes the mantle here, delivering a performance out of this world, easily on par with the Batman animated series.Be it known, this caped avenger stands for the good of Gotham City that the police force and its counterparts can't represent, the good that has no jurisdiction, no procedures...and no rules, save for one. I can only hope that we've seen just the prelude to the Dark Knight's upcoming legendary battles with the worst of Gotham City's dark underside.""The Dark Knight"" gets a solid 10 of 10 stars."
"3408","The Dark Knight",10,"Best movie of 2008 hands down!","I had the honor of watching TDK during a screening and was completely blown away! This isn't just the best Batman movie ever made, this is one of the best movie ever made. Everything in this film is excellent, not one piece of annoyance.Bale marvels as Bruce Wayne/Batman, Ledger has made The Joker in to an iconic movie villain. His performance belongs there at the top with Hopkins Lecter. The Joker has finally been portrait properly on film, he has earned his place between the big boys in movie villandom. This is the true Joker every Batman fan knows, loves and fears. Ledger deserves any and every movie award known to man for this brilliant display.Nolan has made his ""I will always be remembered"" movie, this is the crownjewel in his portfolio. Perfect directing, perfect story, perfect balance between action and drama, everything is perfect. Even if you hate Batman, you will love this film. If you don't, then something beez wrongz with youz!"
"3409","The Dark Knight",10,"Heath Ledger is a ledgend!","Well here it is, one of the most anticipated movies of the year so far. How was it? It was excellent. By far the best Batman film ever made and of course it will be one of the most memorable action films for a long while.Everyone was waiting to see how well Heath Ledger performed as The Joker in this film. He definitely deserves an Oscar in his honor. The character was so dark and creepy that it sent chills up my back. Compared to Heath's other films like '10 Things I Hate About You' and even 'Brokeback Mountain' proves that this man could actually act, doesn't matter what character, he could do it.The film's storyline has many twists and all are rewarding, the story is developed constantly after each scene, making you wonder what's next. Excellent craft and flows well towards the conclusion.During the film on the scene with Batman against the Joker, Bike vs Truck. People thought this was the ending. No, it kept going which was awesome, the story kept getting darker and darker, I guess that's why they called it the 'Dark' Knight as well as the relation to Batman himself.The cast was great. With Christopher Nolan playing Batman, good performance, Heath Ledger played extremely well, Maggie was annoying at times, but still deserves to be praised. Michael Caine and Morgan Freeman had minor roles which satisfied the audiences. Aaron Eckhart starts with a minor role which slowly progresses and becomes evil which is quite surprising and entertaining to watch.Great directing made the movie enjoyable, they added more action this time which made the film feel powerful, lighting was done well especially showing Harvey/ Two Face's face in the many moods he displayed.Great explosions made it entertaining. Made you feel great that this is finally the best action to come in a long time.This movie deserves a 10/10 rating and credit on behalf of the great young actor Heath Ledger's life. (May he R.I.P) His performance made what this film is right now.I recommend this film for any action fan, especially a Batman fan. Or if your even a Heath Ledger fan. Go ahead right now and see this film. It's great!"
"3410","The Dark Knight",10,"Amazing!","Amazing film. Closest thing we will ever get to a perfect superhero movie."
"3411","The Dark Knight",10,"Still the Greatest","11 years after Gotham City was rocked by Heath Ledger's Joker, The Dark Knight is still holding the title as the greatest superhero movie ever made.This movie will forever be the film every future Batman movie will be measured against. The Dark Knight is my idea of the perfect movie completing various character arcs and requiring no build up. One did not need to watch Batman Begins to understand The Dark Knight, despite these movies being in a series. The Avengers films require the previous Marvel MCU films to be seen prior to the superheroes fighting Loki, Ultron, and Thanos.Reviews for The Dark Knight continue to be written, and lengthy analysis videos posted on YouTube. This movie is still the greatest film of all time."
"3412","The Dark Knight",10,"The best comic book movie in existence","There are few movies where you just feel privileged because you get to watch them and are honoured to. This is one of them."
"3413","The Dark Knight",10,"R.I.P. Heath Ledger. This portray of Joker will never be forgotten.","Lets begin by stating that this movie should only be watched in IMAX. If you are a big Batman fanatic, spend a couple extra dollars and you'll get your money's worth. This is the best movie of 2008, no other film will come close.Christopher Nolan has made his masterpiece, with the help of his brother Jonathan creating the script. The perfect balance between superhero action and drama can be found here in The Dark Knight. The acting is top-notch. Not a single actor in this movie comes up short. Christian Bale portrays Batman better than he did in its predecessor. Aaron Eckhart impresses with his take of Harvey Dent. Maggie does a fantastic job playing the role of Rachel Dawes. Heath Ledger is Oscar worthy in his attempt at the infamous Batman rival, The Joker. Ledger's performance is just absolutely stunning. No words can describe how much he attracts the viewer and shines on the big screen.There is no reason why anyone should say this movie was bad. Those who gave this movie a poor rating should be ashamed of themselves for their lack of intelligence. Yes I said. LACK OF INTELLIGENGE! Even if your not a Batman fanatic, this film has a meaning and purpose. It will give you excitement and also something to ponder about for the rest of the day, night, morning, etc. No spoilers but its lengthy running time of 152 minutes beats the hell out of any other superhero comic book adaptation previously made and for years to come. Ledger's stunning acting portrayal of the Joker is good enough for you to spend the money. Do not wait for it to come out on DVD, WATCH IT IN IMAX!"
"3414","The Dark Knight",10,"Bat-A-Man!","There is just one thing that differentiates a legend from ordinary man. It's his fight with inner demons to over come all his fear. That defines a legend. And this is what Batman stands for. Batman is not just another comic character but it's a complete saga of how you stand tall in spite of losing everything, walk fearlessly even when you are lonely and how you fight back against all odds and over shadow your own fear. Fear- the most dominated emotion, mankind has ever witnessed. Batman is no exception, he still has fear, he still gets scared of losing those who are close to him and he is still in doubts when it comes to decision. But what is interesting and inspirational about Batman is that he has the ability to use wisely the biggest and most dangerous weapons of all time perfectly- BRAIN! That's why he is my favourite comic character and this time, Batman is putting everything on the line to save the world from out of control freak- the Joker.A spell bounded performance by Heath Ledger as the Joker. Though, he is no more with us but his immortal act as joker is an Oscar winning performance and will always be remembered. Your heart comes out to mouth to see the horror Joker creates. In start, I was bit confused as his performance reminded me of Jack Nicholson from the first Batman movie but later, I realised that this is for real. He did not imitate Jack but showcased the true and horrible side of a real joker. The best part about Heath is that he displayed the flip side of a joker- FEARLESS. There are many times when we feel that some one could have done better with certain roles but not here. Here, Heath is perfect as a joker and from now on, I will call him Heath 'Joker' Ledger!The story is about a terror that has shaken the underworld of Gotham. The fear of Batman is getting in to criminal minds and all of them are now thinking where their money can be saved from Batman's reach. And that's where the Joker comes with a plan to these criminals- kill Batman. Now with his perverted mind, the Joker is behind Batman's life and what follows is a scary hell of a ride of hide n seek game of faith vs. courage. At one end, Joker has no fear and on the other, Batman has a responsibility of saving Gotham. Now the important question is that who will win and more than that at what cost?Apart from breaking box office records, this movie is also able to break the pattern of film making. Batman series is an action series. When you make an action movie you give the required pace in a movie by focusing on elaborating the action scenes but here, the director builds the movie with a mix of action as well as other emotional scenes. Step by step movie gives its audience action and emotion at the time when it's required but with an unexpected style. Dark, intense and a complete Batman style. The Batman movies are famous for its back ground music and The Dark Knight is no exception. Specially, when there is sound of a whistle in background of some intense scenes in the movie. I felt a rush in to my blood and boiling my brain. My eyes popped out while watching those scenes. To mention, Batman's grilling session with the Joker is a masterpiece. The scene was simply awesome mainly coz of background music. Harvey Dent's character could have been better post he becomes 2-faced. I was expecting his character to be more involved and longer in the series. Rachel Dawes is also a very strong influencing character in the movie. Her involvement in the movie is much focused than Katie Holmes in Batman Begins but the point I'm making here is the glam factor in this movie. She was not given that much footage in a glamorous way. Nevertheless, the plot did not allow audience to think that way either. Action scenes in this movie are well thought of and will chill the audiences' spinal chords. My favourite is the chase scene where Joker is trying best to catch Harvey Dent and how Batman comes in between. This is where Batman says 'asta la vista' and welcomes his new girl friend- his damn new bike! It's called Batpod! I can imagine how excited you will be when you know that Batman is now going to catch the Joker and Joker is happy that Batman has missed his shot. This is sheer delight to watch the creative involvement of special effects blended with brilliant cinematography. Unlike other Hollywood flicks, The Dark Knight is a lengthy movie of more than 2 ½ hrs of non-stop adrenaline but you won't mind spending that much time watching it. Many times we feel that some movies could've been shorter and some lengthier but with 'The Dark Knight' that's not the case. It's mainly because the movie ends up at the time when it is required to scroll the curtains down. I was so satisfied while coming out from the movie hall. Perfect ending!Well, The Dark Knight is just a beginning. Now I'm expecting the Penguin and the Riddler to come in to the picture and take this battle ahead. As I said earlier, I'm a big fan of Batman and after this movie, I'm mad about not just Batman, but each and every part of his movies, music and, The Joker!. Now, while I'm rushing straight to the nearest movie store to buy all original movies and soundtracks of Batman series, you go ahead and enjoy a fearless life just like the Joker or Batman- choice is yours!"
"3415","The Dark Knight",10,"Let's not kid ourselves...","Quite obviously the best superhero movie ever made. By a large margin as well. Nothing before or since has even came close (including the other two movies in this trilogy) and probably never will. Dark, mature, sophisticated, exhilarating, emotional, and a true acting powerhouse. Pure cinema."
"3416","The Dark Knight",9,"KNOW YOUR LIMITS MASTER WAYNE","THE DARK KNIGHT trilogy continues & THE JOKER takes center stage as GOTHAM suffers by the hand of a psychotic menacing clown who cares not for the proceeds of crime but only the mayhem & destruction he can entertain himself with , played brilliantly in a premature SWAN SONG by HEATH LEDGER , THE JOKER is hell bent on destroying THE BATMAN as he sees him as the only thing standing in his way , THE JOKER infiltrates the underworld & gains power in a coup d'tat as he tears GOTHAM apart in explosive and reckless fashion , meanwhile BRUCE WAYNE is contemplating how his alter ego is received by the public & whether or not he is a hero or criminal & a new hero is emerging in GOTHAM through the justice system as HARVEY DENT puts the criminals away for fun as GOTHAM'S D.A....THE JOKER uses every resource he can muster to turn GOTHAM against each other and RACHEL DAWES provides him with leverage as the love interest of both HARVEY & BRUCE...soon BATMAN is compromised & he is forced to make an impossible decision ,one that will ultimately turn hero's into villains & law into crime in a role reversal finale....PARALLEL SEQUEL that does not disappoint with a special performance from LEDGER ...RECOMMENDED."
"3417","The Dark Knight",10,"Great Heath Ledger steals the show...","The highlight of this film is one man and one man only...the Late Heath Ledger...his Oscar-worthy performance marks the best work in his short lifetime...and not only him, but Christopher Nolan should also be commended in the way in which he developed the atmosphere of the film; the camera-work was excellent, the pace was gripping, the plot was thrilling and the acting was splendid. Background music also suited the atmosphere to the highest degree. All in all, a perfect film and magnificent acting...the film should have been named after the joker...Batman himself was not needed....such a Batman film will never again be produced, due to the unfortunate absence of Heath Ledger.10/10 rating...well done"
"3418","The Dark Knight",7,"great but doesn't deserve to be compared with masterpieces","Christopeher Nolan is a talented director. With batman begins,he created such a fantastic atmosphere that he brought batman character back in game. With the dark knight, he made not only a great second sequel, but also one of the best movies of the past 10 years. He mixed action, heroism, feeling, literature, colors so well that you feel kind of high when the movie ends. There is no doubt about it. But i see some people who don't mind to compare this movie with some old masterpieces and say the dark knight is the best movie so far.Haha, this is completely unacceptable.Let me clear this: If a movie can bring freshness to creativity, If a movie happens to change your insights, If a movie starts a new genre, gives away new techniques and styles, If a movie makes you understand your heart better; then I call that movie a masterpiece. As far as I see, The Dark Knight is far from it. But I still feel like I have to congratulate Christopher Nolan for making such a good film. Thanks..."
"3419","The Dark Knight",10,"Wonderful. How superhero movies should be made!","Quite simply ""Dark Knight"" is the best superhero movie ever made (ok, KickAss is the only competitor, but strictly speaking, it isn't a ""proper"" superhero movie, so let's forget about that).Batman is tough, Batman is loved, Batman is weak, Batman is hated. Batman has human characteristics. Batman's enemies have human characteristics. This is the first and main reason Dark Knight succeeds. It isn't ""just"" a superhero movie. It's also a study of character, of good and of ""dark"" and of perception of ""society."" I mean, it does this so well I sometimes think the superhero content is just a scapegoat for the deeper thought in the movie even though I know at the same that it's not. Secondly, Batman doesn't do anything too unbelievable. Look at Superman, he's flying. Look at Spiderman, he's got webs coming out of his palms. Look at the Hulk he can get MASSIVE when he is angry. That's all cool and entertaining, but Batman is, imo, the superhero whom we can connect to the closest, because he doesn't have these ""abilities"" about him which are soooo unrealistic. So, both his inner and outer character are human like which makes the movie so much more enjoyable. The action? The action in Dark Knight is amazing! Batman's car is amazing! The special effects are amazing! It is a phenomenal piece of work crafting a movie where it looks and feels fantastic!I won't talk much about Heath Ledger's portrayal of the joker. It's definitely his best performance ever, and what better time to have it just before his death, peace be upon him. I hate a ball watching the guy act. He's just created an insanely unique persona. I loved it!Everything in Dark Knight works. It's got so much novelty to it. It's a rare piece of cinema where prima facie it's for kids, but ultimately, adults will end up enjoying it much more. Dark Knight isn't for kids anyway, they wont be able to comprehend the bigger picture in Dark Knight, which is what makes this movie so special. It's cool It's original It's awesomeI can't believe how it wasn't nominated for a Best Picture. Oscars were probably too stunned at how good a super hero movie could be. Did I mention I also love Gary Oldman, the guy plays a different person in every movie, I can never tell its him"
"3420","The Dark Knight",9,"I am not a fan , I just saw it on TV","Today was actually Batman day(literally), so they had this movie on TV.
I saw it and liked it.
The Dark Knight is well put together for any movie . Great acting from Bale and Ledger.
Hans Zimmer's soundtrack will keep you on your feet.
As always , Nolan's direction is as quirky as it gets.Though I am not a fan I pretty much enjoyed it , I guess you will too if you are into superheroes."
"3421","The Dark Knight",NA,"Way Overrated.","The buzz from the entire media, and the general public made it sound like this was the second coming of Star Wars. Well it wasn't. A matter of fact, this way over hyped pile of garbage is one of the worse movies i have seen in years. Where to begin. Lets start with the so called great acting. You must be kidding me. Ledger does not deserve an Oscar nomination for this. If anything, Jack Nicholson does a far better job playing the Joker. Christian Bale basically mumbles through most of his Bat man parts, and isn't much better when he isn't. Plot is stupid as heck. They make the Joker sound like some super human beast from another world. A dozen officers with machine guns would of killed him off in 2 seconds. But i guess that would of ruined the story line. Any way you analyze this movie. Its just plain old bad."
"3422","Extraction",7,"Great action, zero plot","The action scenes are really good. Close combat with extremely long shots in tight spaces. Sometimes it has a shooter video game feel to it. Hemsworth and the stunt team really showed of their skills. This movie is really more about close combat scenes, than crazy Hollywood stunts a la mission Impossible. Other than that, all the story is already in the title, which is fine for this type of movie. The actor, who played the boy was a wonderful casting choice. He was carrying the whole emotion of story. We'll be seeing more of him. Other characters were not drawn out. This movie is not for everyone, it is not well rounded, it's all action and no story. I personally enjoyed it though. I recommend this for viewers that like close combat action and martial arts movies."
"3423","Extraction",NA,"Solid and violent action flick","""Extraction"" is fast, vicious and simple. With a death count that's approaching John Wick 3 levels of bullet ballet, the movie hardly pauses for breath.Chris Hemsworth is excellent as the haunted mercenary Tyler Rake. This is a very physical role and Hemsworth delivers in spades.8 out of 10."
"3424","Extraction",8,"An aggressively average plot, elevated by incredible action and great performances","Tyler Rake (Chris Hemsworth) is tasked with extracting the son of a druglord amids an all-out drug war. Battling hostiles and a troubled past along the way.Thank you Jon Wick for upping the game for action films! Extraction excels in its action set pieces. Long, gorgeous takes with brutally grounded fight scenes, showcase the vicious nature of warfare. Hemsworth carries this entire film on his shoulders and has the daunting task of elevating the paper thin narrative to an acceptable level. Thankfully, he succeeds. Thor can act darn it, and in this film he proves it yet again.Like Jon Wick before him, seeing Hemsworth kicking ass in amazingly choreographed fight scenes, is exhilarating. The film is unapologetically honest in its depiction of violence and its consequences. Riding on fantastic sound design, every impact, bullet wound and car crash pulls you in deeper and deeper in the film."
"3425","Extraction",9,"Well worth it.. wow","Negative reviews have focused on the alleged shortfall in the depth of the plot. Really? Most action movies out there... how many have a plausible plot? At least for this movie, the plot is plausible, the action, obviously a stretch. But those critics railing on the movie forget what a movie is supposed to be all about. Entertainment. It's not a real life documentary, not an ensemble boring drama piece. When it comes to wham-bang entertainment, this movie delivers on all cylinders. The movie is probably more analogous to a version of masterful The Raid than an Oscar drama piece. Live with it. Watch it. Enjoy. It is a movie. It will keep you glued. Though the squeamish may need to take a break."
"3426","Extraction",7,"OK Plot, Immense Action Scenes, Hemsworth Nails It","I'm not much of a writer, so I'll keep the review short.The plot is nothing new, but is interesting enough. However, Chris Hemsworth knocks it out the park with his performance - I really didn't expect that from him, but he is awesome in this.The action scenes are great, and some of the camera work and filming techniques are fantastic.The film is a 6/10, but I gave it a 7/10 for the action scenes and Hemsworth's performance."
"3427","Extraction",7,"A violent film with some seriously good action sequences","In a world that is currently minus new films, to get a fresh one delivered to us via Netflix was a much needed treat. And I'm glad to report that 'Extraction' was worth the wait. It isn't a flawless movie, but it certainly has some good things going for it. The action sequences were probably the highlight of the film for me. I'm not usually someone who appreciates or even notices good action sequences, but I did with this film which says something. There is one sequence that really blew me away. It is a one-shot sequence that goes on for quite some time and has some amazing ingenuity behind it. Definitely the highlight of the film.Chris Hemsworth was right at home in this role. He doesn't have to do a lot of speaking, and can just let his actions speak for themselves. Some of the stunt work in this film would not have been easy. When he is required to slow things down and have some dialogue in the odd scene he does so adequately.The film surprised me with just how violent it was willing to be at times, especially in scenes involving children. There were a couple of time where I thought - they're not going to do that are they? - and then sure enough they did. This is a very serious film as well. Very little (if any that I can think of) humour whatsoever makes an appearance.The film does get a little tedious towards the end. You can only watch so many people getting shot without becoming numb and a little bored by it. Also the film opens with a shot from near the end of the film. It doesn't work though because there is no intrigue behind it. This was one of the few poor choices an otherwise very good film made however. I would recommend giving this one a watch."
"3428","Extraction",6,"Good actions but what a weak plot!!","The entire movie is filled with close combat shots. It's great for someone who likes a lot of actions but for someone like who looks for a story in movies, I had a hard time trying to grasp this movie.
It literally shows a poor country like Bangladesh lost thousands of its elite force, a general and dispersed an entire city just to support a gangster and save his kidnapped boy from escaping. Looks like Bangladesh went into an entire war to help the gangster no matter what.
Just leave that logic aside and you can enjoy the movie as a fast paced, action packed video game."
"3429","Extraction",7,"From bangladesh, I know an action movie doesn't represent culture, but....","I am Bangladeshi. But I know this movie was not made with our culture. But Hindi songs go from house to house in Bangladesh! What an awkward thing! Then writing Hindi on the street, Hindi pronunciation in every word, what are these? Learning from Kolkata, if Dhaka is named, then this is the situation! The job of a director and team is to check and select well. They have lost completely. But the actions of this movie were extraordinary. chris and randeep have done a great job.I know an action movie doesn't represent culture, but the movie is criticized for its lack of analysis by the director and the team. A little better analysis was needed, because here the names of the russo brothers are involved. And i love russo brothers and chris my thor so much...."
"3430","Extraction",9,"The best single shot in a action film","Impressive camera work and action sequence. All the actors did a great job in making this film very entertaining. The fight scenes are great, the knife fights are authentic and the shoot out was exhilarating. I guess my only critic on this is the plot perhaps a different twist about who the boy was would have made it more interesting but nevertheless an awesome action film overall. Again hats off to the camera work, fantastic job!"
"3431","Extraction",8,"It's a good movie if you appreciate good stunt coordination","Now, it's not a greate movie nor is it a bad movie, it's somewhere in between. I mean the stunt work is really, really great, and the protagonist does have his moments of weakness, and it has that kind of action you come to expect from action movies today (one man against the whole world) but i bet that there was someone working on that movie that had millitary expirience.. One of rare movies in which the guy actually checks to see if the gun has bullets when he steals it, actually counting bullets in a magazine or having an empty gun or chamber...
Yes the movie has poor CGI, too much yellow color grading and unrealistic shooting and fighting scenes but it still has it's moments of actual care for the character even though it's not as developed."
"3432","Extraction",6,"We have seen the plot umpteenth no of times, the action is nothing extraordinary, the villains were typical Bollywood style n laughable, the ending a big meh.","Had expectations aft seeing the trailer but it all fizzled once the movie started playing.
It has a ridiculous story, tension n character development is nada.
I am totally surprised that inspite of this film being backed by Netflix, with amazing star cast, it lacked the substance.
The hand to hand combat with the knife is not thrilling. For the real deal (silat fighting) check out The Raid Redemption.
As a fan of Randeep Hooda, I am happy that he got a good role.
The babe is attractive.
The hint near the swimming pool at the end is again a big meh with the possible of a sequel.
Now that will be too much for a guy to survive with bullets pierced all over."
"3433","Extraction",9,"Forget the storyline just relish the action/directorship","Thoroughly enjoyed this film - weak storyline but it's totally forgiven because of its brilliant action and the camera work on it is a thing of beauty.
you're glued to the car chases and fights to the point where you feel you should be smelling the exhaust fumes and that if you don't dodge out the way you're going to get a smack in the mouth or shot.
The Director could do a James Bond film no problem.
it's got the rawness of action that's needed"
"3434","Extraction",10,"Great action flick","Just a good solid action flick, Hemsworth does a great job, and well directed.Want to play a drinking game that'll get you wasted fast? Read through the user reviews and do a shot every time some Bangladeshi leaves a one star review and cries about the portrayal of their Country. (I've been there, the movie is flattering if anything)"
"3435","Extraction",7,"Well directed fight scene","You are looking for gun fight action movie ,just go for it."
"3436","Extraction",5,"Action Packed but Completely missed the Environment of Dhaka","The premise of the movie was supposed to set in Dhaka, a city of 10+ million people in Bangladesh. Unfortunately, they completely missed mark making the set in Dhaka.To start with, the accent of the locals are wrong, they are speaking in an accent that's commonly used in West Bengal, India. Dhaka and People in Bangladesh, in General, have a completely different accent. Throughout the movie, Hindi songs are heard in the background, where everyone is watching tv during midday. People go to work here, Dhaka is the capital, nobody sits on their asses watching TV midday. Bangladesh has its own music industry, although the movie had some issues acquiring copyright for some of the songs to play in the background.The environment is wrong. Sure Dhaka has slums and dirty places, but most of the city is developed enough with an actual nice road system. If they set the scene somewhere else in Bangladesh, it would've been more convincing. The roads are basically dirt roads in this movie where Dhaka has one of the best road systems in the Country. Dhaka doesn't have that kinda dense jungle anywhere near the city, certainly not near the Buriganga river.The criminal class in Bangladesh is completely different. This isn't Africa, people don't employ child soldiers here. And certainly carry Ak-47 in hand and in the open.The Police uniform and looks are completely misjudged. They are trying to portray the elite force of Bangladesh, Known as Rapid Action Battalion. They are not regular police. The deal with counter-terrorism and similar stuff. It should've been the police that deals with criminal or action in the street. Police vehicles are wrong.Don't get me wrong, the entire movie is brilliantly shot and exceptionally action-packed. But this provides a complete misrepresentation of Bangladesh, as well as the city of Dhaka. People who don't have an idea about Bangladesh will get a false sense for a beautiful country by the misrepresented set of this movie."
"3437","Extraction",9,"Jason Bourne meets Call of Duty, in Mumbai","Wow shocked at the undeserving low score! This is stunt actor Sam Hargrave's first full length feature film sitting in the directors chair, and he nailed it. Outstanding action/fight choreography, great cinematography, perfect pacing for the 116 min runtime, and all around great performances, especially Hemsworth's kick-ass character. I'm reading the reviews about no plot... seriously? Just because there's no surprising unpredictable plot twist doesn't mean there's no plot. It was a simple story, adapted into a screenplay from the graphic novel by Ande Parks, and presented on a bullet ridden testosterone plate. What more does anyone want for that perfect weekend popcorn action flick? I thoroughly enjoyed it! It's a well deserved 9/10 from me.

"3438","Extraction",7,"Extraction","The latest Netflix original film to arrive on the streaming service. Extraction sees Tyler Rake (Chris Hemsworth), a black market mercenary, embark on the most deadly extraction of his career when he's enlisted to rescue the kidnapped son (Rudhraksh Jaiswal) of an imprisoned international crime lord.As much as their originals are hit and miss and the sheer amount of content they release being ridiculous, there is no question that Netflix allow pure filmmaker freedom without the restrictions and interference of Hollywood influence as here the film is allowed to make full use of its 18 rating and not have the burden of setting up or continuing a franchise. Though generic and cliche in its story telling, the action and stunt work are an absolute blast to witness and make this a step up from what I was expecting.The film's 2 hour runtime may have some filler sequences around the middle section, but the 1st and 3rd acts are fast paced and frantic, throwing you right into the situation, the film knows exactly what it wants and sets out to deliver it. The race against time and constant improvisation of the extraction itself makes for a consistently engaging watch, though the film does brush over motivations (the villain here is especially lacklustre) and character back story, with Tyler solely relying on a few flashbacks and essentially an exposition interview with the kid he is protecting, so that we get more of his story.However what this basic premise does allow for is to be filled with brutal, well choreographed and creative action. This film delivers one of the best set pieces of this year, with a phenomenal one-take style 15 minute sequence, which goes from a car chase, to a building assault to a lorry chase, it's absolute controlled chaos. As a fan of John Wick, The Raid etc. it was excellent to see their influence on the choreography, the camerawork never is too shaky or quick cutting meaning it is easy to follow and witness every stab, punch, kick in their bone crunching and visceral glory. The shootouts sound great and are intense, always ending in bloody results, especially the finale sequence.It's good seeing Hemsworth in a grittier, darker non-Thor/MIB role and he delivers here in a more somber and focused role, though also channels some of the action hero vibe of the 80/90's that this film is going for. Jaiswal is also good here as the kid thrown into this life or death situation, he is never irritating or acts unrealistically at all (which is the case with kids in these types of films at times). Randeep Hooda has an intimidating screen presence as someone working for the kid's father and David Harbour gives an enthusiastic performance, though his character's section does stall the plot pacing.Extraction is a fun watch to turn your brain off for 2 hours and was actually better than I expected. The action is bloody, visceral and frantic with some brilliant practical effects and choreography and the cast give good performances. The film does suffer from several cliches and genre traits and lack of character depth, but honestly from a purely entertainment perspective this does the job."
"3439","Extraction",8,"All the Haters from Bangladesh missed the point","I think that people from Bangladesh are taking this way too personally. I mean this is not a tourist video for your beloved country but rather a balls-to-the-wall action movie. The only reason they are bitter is because India had a lot to do with the movie. So an honest review is that yes this is action packed with some great hand to hand combat scenes and gun fights...it is however lacking plot. Chris Hemsworth is great and his supporting cast are excellent as well."
"3440","Extraction",7,"Great Action Scenes","I don't care how it portrayed Dhaka. It was a great action thriller. Plot is not anything serious or unique, but actions are great really."
"3441","Extraction",8,"Great Action and Chris is the best thing","Well good action. Not that close representation of Dhaka, more of an Indian gimic. Hating the Indian accent, Bangladeshi doesn't have that accent.
Chris did well, story cud have been much more.
None the less good to see Dhaka in international names, tho it was negative.
Chris was the only good actor that i actually found, the kid speaks irritatingly slow and doesn't seem to gave the right face for the scene. Better cast wud have been better along with Chris."
"3442","Extraction",7,"Really?","Good close quarter combats but a plot would have been nice.
Recommended if you're stuck in quarantine and have nothing better to do with your life like me."
"3443","Extraction",5,"Disappointment for the story","How on earth a movie of this level have literally portraying no motive of kidnapping at all. Chris did his best !"
"3444","Extraction",9,"Superb action movie and well performed.","First of all this movie is for entertainment so don't give negative comments on the basis of bangladeshi image.
Its a fun action ride so enjoy and don't miss this flick.
This netflix movie is mindblowing and interesting,i will mention both positive and negative points of this movie:-
Positive:-
1). Action and fight sequences
2). Acting and performance by both actors Chris n Randeep.
3). Screenplay
4). Direction
5). Fast StorylineNegative-
1)- Plot(because only one thing i can't understand that how army of an country work under a drug lord and lock down capital on the order of drug lord?)But overall movie is worth watching and don't think about negative comments because its just a one sided."
"3445","Extraction",8,"Good action movie","I don't get all the negative reviews for this. It's an action movie. There's a lot of shooting, fighting, and dead bodies and the plot makes sense. I really enjoyed it for what it was: an action movie."
"3446","Extraction",6,"Average Product By Netflix","Missing logics & lack of reality.......actions sequences are undoubtedly superb....specially first fighting sequence in Dhaka that was excellent one take shot........I was hoping this will gonna something like lone saviour or 12 strong type but it's some average action movie, that's it."
"3447","Little Women",8,"Little Women, Big Movie","This review is coming from someone who doesn't know the book and never seen any other Little Women movie. I completely fell in love with the story, it's simplicity, emotional twists and drama. The performances are fantastic and talk about a cast, probably one of the best in 2019. Since Meryl Streep to Emma Watson, Timothée Chalamet, Florence Pugh, Laura Dern, Saoirse Ronan and even Chris Cooper looks good on this movie. The future of Hollywood is very well preserved with all this talent, so young and already so well established in the industry (Eliza too!). Loved all the performances, specially Saiorse who gives such a brilliant performance it goes beyong supporting actress. The costume design are always so beautiful and the cinematography gorgeous. Saying that Gerwig was overlooked is an understatement as everything she did was nominated except herself. Hope it does well in the Oscars but if not, it remains one of my favorite movies of 2019!"
"3448","Little Women",8,"a fascinating film!","This film is simply spectacular! The acting is superb by everone in the cast, the attention to detail here is just breathtaking. I was wondering during the film that how much time and effort were into making this movie.I was a bit annoyed by the non-linearity of the script and thought it was overdone but besides that I enjoyed this film a lot. Go see this."
"3449","Little Women",9,"We need more films like this","So the writer/director was snubbed by the Oscars. And the industry wonders why the audience is no longer there. It's because people won't pay your high prices for the crap you are producing. Few of the really good films were even nominated for an Oscar. So keep producing films that only others in Hollywood will go to see, and you will go broke.
Now for this film. Like another reviewer I have never read the book or seen previous movies. But I really enjoyed this movie. My only complaint is that because of the constant change of time (like in all other movies that use that method of transition) the story is hard to follow.
I must say the actress playing the lead and Laura Dern are superb. I have long been in love with Laura Dern and now even more so. I also am in love with Emma Watson but was very disappointed with her performance. I'm so glad I saw her in ""Beauty and the Beast""."
"3450","Little Women",5,"too much back and forth","It was going back and forth too much. A little more chronology would have been better in my opinion."
"3451","Little Women",8,"Entertaining. 94 version? Cannot judge which one is better","Finally saw LITTLE WOMEN 2019. Didn't expected much cause I really liked 94 version by Gillian Armstrong with Winona Ryder , Gabriel Byrne , Trini Alvarado , Christian Bale and Susan Sarandon.
Well, the casting was something that I cannot judge which one is better. Both are so so great. But Christian Bale 94, I liked better than Timothée Chalamet 2019 (Although he was good but didn't overcome THE Christian).Two things really grabbed me.1. The camera and light. The camera is keep moving even for the steady shots. They released the tripod and moved a little to adjust each actors even a small movement they make.
They also use sunlight so beautifully like Pride and Prejudice.
Aldo a couple of slow motions and mintage sequences are beautiful too.2. The music. It is not like here I am listen like Hans Zimmer or Max Richter or even Cliff Martinez who would say even if the movie suck I am still here. Think that at least you've watched a great Music Video cause of my music.
In this movie the music is there clearly and when it comes to really important moments, It really boost up the heart of audience. But it's more like supporting way. I felt it from the very beginning. Ok wow this guy knows OST!! Alexandre is more of a classic composer who made OST like The Danish Girl, The Tree of life, Julie & Julia and Philomena.I cannot say this movie will win (was nominated for 6 Academy) a lot of awards from all around the world but it has beautiful beautiful acting ensenble and light, camera and music wise. Work of art.Also the acting sometimes made my heart beat.
Even the makeup is so great. Of course the director is also an actress so she knows how to deal with these stuff, right?Last. The time. It goes back and forth from the past to present a couple of times but it was not confusing or breaking any concentration cause it was so nicely connected by editing and bridge music. (The cast y-oung and old -was the same too which didn't matter as well.)
Something that was different with the 94 version.It is an inspiring movie after all and I won't rest tonight to finish my humble feature writing for my next project."
"3452","Little Women",8,"Wonderful","Really well done, didn't expect before going to theatre but the director has been able to mix a great performance from all the actors with a well-done screenplay. Not the normal Little Woman, a personal version of Greta Gerwig."
"3453","Little Women",9,"Generous Filmmaking","As one who has not read the book, I cannot speak to the accuracy of this film, but I will attest to its authenticity. There is a warmth burning at its heart and it brings great light to its characters as well as awful shadow. I call this film generous because it gives the viewer so much. So much intelligence, so much kindness, so much sadness: so much to love and wonder. And it does all of it without being a ""romantic"" movie. It it is aware of the realities of women during this time period and treats marital situations with honesty, but also with grace. There is romance, but it is merely a part for these characters which I think is Gerwig's biggest accomplishment; to draw these women as more without the need to make them gritty, troubled, or with hubris. This film is a portrait of their lives painted with generosity without becoming poor. The cinematography is gorgeous, the casting is supreme, the writing memorable and the performance unforgettable. Saoirse Ronan and Timothée Chalamet are delightful on screen together and there is a general air of touching tenderness and welcoming mind in all the characters down to the extras. I tip my hat to this film and say bravo, Gerwig and company, bravo, to you and everyone who worked on it."
"3454","Little Women",10,"The Noble Nature of ""Little Women""","In Writer and Director Greta Gerwig's adaptation of Louisa May Alcott's ""Little Women"", Jo March, Alcott's Hero, played by Saoirse Ronan, regrets her angry unforgiving nature over her younger sister Amy, played by Florence Pugh, who could have died, because of her irresponsibility. Wise Mother Marmee, played by Laura Dern, sits beside distraught Jo. She says that she knows what it's like to be ""angry nearly every day of my life"". She hopes that Jo does better. Jo confesses to her consuming writer's passion, and Amy's callous act when they were children.Marmee reminds, ""There are some natures too noble to curb, too lofty to bend."" Perhaps, following one's greater nature is more about what you're willing to give up. That too is the eloquent beauty of Greta's ""Little Women"". Greta reunites with Saoirse from ""Lady Bird"" in Alcott's rites of passage tale of unconditional love. Saoirse plays the young vulnerable idealist Jo, who wants to be taken legitimately as a writer. Still, she wants to be loved.Saoirse's Jo cops to her loneliness to compassionate Laura's Marmee. Mom asks Jo if she loves Laurie, played by charmingly aloof Timothee Chalamet. Jo says, ""I want to be loved."" Marmee says, ""That's not the same as loving."" No, it's not.Still, Jo has unconditional love. Returning home from New York to care for her ailing sister Beth, played by quietly strong Eliza Scahlen, she reads to Beth at the beach. Weakened Beth wants to hear more of Jo's own stories. She tells her, ""Keep writing... after I'm gone."" Jo's eyes well with tears. So did mine.""Little Women"" has great soulfulness and humanity. Life is both joy and loss on the journey of creating your own greater version. Life is about defining your calling, your purpose, and finding balance. Yes, we all want to be loved. Maybe part of being loved is forgiving others and ourselves, and giving love back, too. Rather, I believe that's what Greta Gerwig and Louisa May Alcott are trying to say.Set during the US Civil War, Director Greta brilliantly weaves childhood flashback into her very contemporary transformational narrative. The 1860's was not the time for women, which might be the social irony of Alcott's novel. Wealthy Aunt March, played with humorous gravitas by Meryl Streep, reminds Amy that a woman must either have money or marry a man with it.Laura's Marmee raises her 4 daughters Jo, Meg, Amy, and Beth, played by Saoirse, Emma Watson, Florence, and Eliza, all alone while her Husband, played by solid Bob Odenkirk, is away supporting the Civil War.The girls all have their individual passions. Jo, of course wants to be a writer. From the time they were young children, she wrote plays for her sisters to performs, albeit reluctantly at times. Meg's passion is acting. Amy wants to be a famous painter. Beth is quiet shy piano protégé.The March's live next door to the very rich Laurence's. Their longtime childhood friend is playboy Theodore 'Laurie'. Timothee embodies surprising charm and depth of emotion in Laurie. Laurie has been in love with Jo, since they were teens. Jo loves Laurie, yet not in the way he wished. That's the designed melodrama of ""Little Women"". What could have been the perfunctory plot device, Greta reinvents as the narrative of self-discovery and forgiveness. Greta's profound muse is Saoirse.Saoirse authentically captures the joy and the suffering in Jo's visage, in her being. She's wickedly funny negotiating her book with publisher Mr. Dashwood, played by cantankerous Tracy Letts, also from ""Lady Bird"". Her kindness comforts when she hugs Marmee following personal tragedy.Saoirse's nobility rises and never bends. That's the distinct heart and humanity of Greta Gerwig's ""Little Women"". Often times, creating the greater versions of ourselves is about letting go. It's about love and forgiveness, for others and for ourselves. That makes watching ""Little Women"" beautiful. Just saying."
"3455","Little Women",10,"I've seen all 4 versions. I'm loving this one","I've read the book a few dozen times. I loved the 2nd version most UNTIL now. This was excellent. The new flow worked well while keeping to the true story. Just loved it."
"3456","Little Women",9,"A lovable adaptation of the beloved source material","Did the world need or ask for another adaptation of Louisa May Alcott's famed novel Little Women? The answer is probably no but after having sat through Greta Gerwig's lovingly shot and beautifully staged version of the beloved story of the March sisters, you'd be hard pressed too find many viewers that weren't glad this new take on the classic story came to life.Announcing herself as a filmmaking force with her directional debut Lady Bird, Gerwig proves here to be the real deal in a very big way, as she takes the reigns behind the camera and takes charged of screenwriting duties as she instills her own flavor and verve into Alcott's family drama.Whilst set in the Civil War era of the United States, Gerwig manages to bring modern day sensibilities and flair to the March's tale, without ever losing sight of the core heart and soul of the narrative that has managed to maintain a place in popular culture for these many years since it's initial release in print form.Little Women is one of those features that feels accomplished and thought through wherever you look from Yorick Le Saux's photogenic cinematography, Jacqueline Durran's sumptuous costume design, through to a typically strong Alexandre Desplat score, as the film showcases Gerwig growing before our eyes as a director in what's a major step up production wise from the small-scale and more independently structured Lady Bird.As with her breakout film, Gerwig has managed to assemble a fantastic and on song cast to bring her vision to screen with every performer bringing their A-game's to proceedings here, as returning Gerwig actors Saoirse Ronan and Timothee Chalamet as the determined and unflappable Jo March and the devilishly charismatic Theodore Laurence respectively shine brightest in a loaded ensemble.With Lady Bird and this higher profile effort under her belt, it's clear that Gerwig is an actors director, as she also oversees the further establishment of 2019 breakout star Florence Pugh, who delivers an awards worthy turn as the more artistic and whimsical March sister Amy.Thanks to the film's overwhelmingly strong performances and technical strengths, the fact that Little Women's now more formulaic and familiar plot movements and processions never threaten to detour from the fact this heartfelt and soulful effort is a thoroughly enjoyable and likable affair, that manages to say some important things about equality and female empowerment without ever feeling preachy or overbearing.A strong vision from a female filmmaker of substantial and timely power.Final Say -A deservingly praised incarnation of a much adapted tale, Little Women is a fabulously watchable version of a literary classic that further enhances Gerwig and her actresses standings in the cinematic landscape.4 1/2 burnt novels out of 5"
"3457","Little Women",8,"Outstanding Version of Alcott's Classic","Greta Gerwig, in my estimation, is one of the most brilliant female scriptwriters/film directors currently making movies. Her version on Alcott's classic novel is spellbinding. She adroitly juxtapositions a several years span between the year composing and publication of her 1868 book and the Civil War years at home when the novel's events took place. I am also appreciative of Yorick Le Saux's plush cinematography. What a duo Gerwig and the French photographer made to produce one of the most gorgeous period pieces in many of a moon.Two minor complaints: The casting of Timothee Chalet, the love interest of two of the sisters. He's portrayed as a young wastrel whose apathy somehow attracts the two into wanting to marry. Another is that Alcott had writing success writing under the nom de plume A.M. Bernard before composing Little Women, a detail totally ignored.Otherwise, an outstanding film that surprised even this guy who went on his wife's insistence."
"3458","Little Women",NA,"not just another superfluous adaptation, but an exquisite showing in its own right","Writer/director Greta Gerwig tries her hand at Alcott's timeless, semi-autobiographical coming-of-age story by spotlighting two different time periods in the lives of the indefatigable March sisters, with first-rate casting featuring Ronan as the free-spirited, aspiring storyteller Jo, Watson as the fashionable, domestic Meg, Pugh as the economical, attention-seeking Amy, Scanlen as the quiet, musical Beth, and their journey from childhood to young adulthood as they pursue their individual hopes and dreams during the 1860s. Even though it isn't a direct page to screen adaptation, and the overlapping of timelines can be taxing at times, Gerwig is able to stage many powerful scenes that explore the all-important themes of sexism, loneliness, friendship, love, and unbreakable familial bonds thanks to four fabulous leading ladies, and quality work from Chalamet, Cooper, and Streep who are invaluable in key supporting roles. ***"
"3459","Little Women",10,"Endearing Characters, Excellent Framing","I would like to hang out with these characters. These ""little women"", if you will. They exhibited themselves with such boisterous youthful brashness that I often found myself laughing, if not gut-chuckling. What a wonderful family-unit; but no, more of a {italics}sister-unit{italics} than a family-unit. I loved the way they got on together and had a whale of a time. (Yet there were also some sad scenes that caused my eyes to self-lubricate.)My favorites were Amy (Pugh) and Jo (Ronan). Amy was rather forceful, fun-loving, raucous, yearning, excitable, whim-worthy, world-trodden, and multifaceted. And she was proud of her feet. Jo, for her part, was well-reasoned, impassioned, headstrong, determined, focused, social-sickened, expectation-allergic, hubby-shunning, void-gazing, and contemplative. And she was a non-breeder.The framing was excellent, some of the best I've ever seen. There were shots of swooning countrysides, stately mansions, comfy cottages, bustling theatre-facades, shivering staircases, glistening snow-scapes, and swirling sand-winds.Greta Gerwig did a great job! <U+0001F483><U+0001F485><U+0001F460><U+0001F457><U+0001F3E1>"
"3460","Little Women",10,"at last, a rich feast","Beyond excellent photography, efficient editing and directing, this movie captures the rich depth of characters the original book brings to life.
Not only will I effusively recommend to family, I intend to watch repeatedly myself."
"3461","Little Women",10,"Beautiful, in every sense","Highly recommend and one of my favorite movies to date. Beautiful adaptation that brings the profound literary themes of the book to life. I felt moved in every single scene. Definitely deserves Oscar!"
"3462","Little Women",10,"Stunning Affirmation of Life, Family, Marriage, and Love","My heart skipped a beat several times (no exaggeration) upon seeing some of the picture book scenes. We have not seen such perfection in staging, color, and lighting since David Lean. Greta Gerwig has entered the filmmaker hall of fame with this truly epic film. I will not quibble about the script, because there are too many good things happening here to pick out flaws, and it is too good for Hollywood, bypassing many of the modern tropes for authenticity.There are three movies here beginning with; child-like hope for the future, disappointment and bitterness over reality, and then what we find during the last third of the film, about which I shall not comment. It is worth the trip.See it in a theater now, especially if you are in your thirties or younger and have only been exposed to the films of the 90's up until now, when real film was eschewed for colorless videos. This one was made with real film's rich texture, depth, and true-ness. These are wonderful locations and settings. Not one scene is given short shrift and there are none lacking attention to detail.It does seem too long at times so be prepared to relax and absorb. In some ways it is an homage to another great period piece in honor of a classic book ""Pride and Prejudice,"" by the amazing Joe Wright. Greta with this film rivals that one. Her script is not better, but her craftsmanship is equal to or greater.Team up with Whit or Noah again Greta, and write your own story with all of
the sparkle of your past films and all of the magic of this one.PS For the critics I would add that most of the world does not have social security. Asians are taught from a young age they will have to support parents when they become too sick or too old to work. Most continents have the same ethic and tradition out of necessity. In the time of Louisa May Alcott marriage and family were everything in the USA and Europe, just like the rest of the world. How you chose meant survival or no survival. Not choosing both was rarely an option. Was life made better after the government got involved in every part of our lives?"
"3463","Little Women",10,"This might be my favorite movie of all time","And I don't say this often (if ever). It seemed to offer answers towards everything I feel as a twenty one year old woman. It hit me on a personal level like no other movie has ever done.Ronan's portrayal of Jo March makes us relate to the character the way one could only ever relate to characters in books where you can use much of your imagination. We can easily understand why she might be the best actress of our generation.There was a lot of crying, but in the good way that leaves you feeling whole towards the end. This movie is an incredible adaption of the book that represents all the struggles us women stand for."
"3464","Little Women",9,"One of the most beautiful films of the year","One of the most beautiful movies of the year. I haven't seen any of the other versions nor did I read the source novel but what I loved most about the film is the beautiful harmony that director Greta Gerwig brings on screen from the very first minute of the movie unit it lasts.
The acting is superb. You have Saoirse Ronan who commands every scene she is in and gives her Jo so much life and makes her also very unpredictable in emotions and reactions. Its really nice to see Ronan on the edge to become truly her generations Meryl Streep. Oh Streep herself was fine in this, giving us quirky Aunt March in a very enjoyable, almost self ironic performance. Loved her characters unintentional sarcasm. Emma Watson is the weakest link, but her character is also the most uninteresting one. However its still sad she didn't do anything to uplift that fact. Florence Pugh is wonderful and totally deserving of her Oscar nomination for her loud, wild and then very calm and sensitive performance. So many emotions in one performance. Just great.
Laura Dern is fine, lovely and giving a very warm performance. Chris Cooper is somehow wasted however it is always a good addition in any movie he is. Eliza Scanlan was great, already loved heir in ""Sharp Objects"" but she did something that Watson wasnt able. Bringing a rather blunt character truly to live. Last but certainly not least there was Timothée Chalamet who gives one of the most underrated performances of the year. How does he not get more mentions for this truly fantastic and fresh performance? And no I am not only talking about *his* scene I am talking about his entire appearance . So natural, so witty, so funny, so charming so tragic so wonderful. Did not expect him to live up to those little women but he did and deserves much more applause for it.
The screenplay was great. I sometimes got a bit confused with the time twists though. Great score by Alexandre Desplat and in the end one of the best films we got to see 2019."
"3465","Little Women",NA,"A Joyful Celebration Of Sisterhood","The 7th film adaptation of Louisa May Alcott's classic novel of the same name is the only version that I've seen so far and frankly, I don't need to check out the ones that surfaced before anymore coz Greta Gerwig's Little Women is an instant classic that impresses on all fronts, and also establishes her as a creative force to be reckoned with.Written & directed by Gerwig in what's her solo sophomore effort, the film is crafted with so much love, passion, honesty, authenticity & heartfelt warmth that it has the viewers under its spell within minutes. Gerwig captures the joy, pain, tenderness & everlasting love between sisters with such effortless purity that it's just beautiful to watch.Coming off the critical & commercial success of Lady Bird, Gerwig proves that she is no one hit wonder, for Little Women is much better & far more mature work from her. The period details, costume design, low-light photography stand out with ease, while excellent editing makes sure there isn't a single wasted scene in the final print.Gerwig's script bestows each character with arcs that exhibit depth & richness, and then she directs the terrific cast of Saoirse Ronan, Florence Pugh, Emma Watson, Eliza Scanlen & others to help them bring their respective roles to life with finesse & vibrancy. Ronan's input is amazing, Pugh is just as good & the rest provide brilliant support but it's their chemistry with one another that clicks best.Overall, Little Women presents Greta Gerwig in stellar form, and is another quality addition to her filmography. Exquisitely highlighting the women's plight, prejudice & powerlessness in those days and to an extent even today, Little Women is a joyful celebration of sisterhood that's highly faithful to its source material and is winsome & whimsical in wonderful ways. One of the best all-round films of 2019."
"3466","Little Women",10,"Exquisite movie","Now this is the way ALL films should be made. Oscar worthy performances, breathtaking scenery and sets, gorgeous costumes and the plot was true to the story. Without going into a lot of detail and spoilers, it was the most beautiful version of this film I've seen this far. Gets my vote for Best Picture. Don't miss it!"
"3467","Little Women",10,"Over Nice Movie","Very lovely movie, Great work from Greta Gerwig, I like the two Path for the Time line , The past and the present, Fantastic Cinema-photography, And excellent soundtrack.
And for the actresses, Awesome Ronan performance she can make the audience Cry and laugh, she goes to much in deep with Joe March, I think Ronan is the next Merly Streep.
To much Thick Role For Emma stone and Meg March, small scene can count with the one Hand finger.
And the other actresses they were Very good
But I wonder Why they told us "" The movie is About Four sister, and when you see the movie it's just Go around one joe March """
"3468","Little Women",9,"Wholesome, heartfelt, brilliant adaptation","My only wish for this movie is that it would be longer. It was a true delight - lovely cinematography, music and gosh the wrITING. Awesome acting as well. Can't wait to see what Greta Gerwig directs next and what the actors will go on to be in."
"3469","Little Women",10,"Superb","This was my favourite childhood read and I went to the cinema in full 'critic mode'. But I was absolutely blown away, enchanted, laughed and cried and remembered why I so loved this story. Casting was perfect, music, cinematography divine."
"3470","Little Women",9,"Refreshing take on an old story!","I found it a bit long for my taste - but other than that, no complaints.
Good cinematography, good background score and loved the constant flashbacks to present takes.
Florence's role as Amy was really good, but so was Saoirse's as Jo's.
Overall, really good entertainment and a feel good movie!"
"3471","Little Women",8,"Really well done film.. well crafted story","Very strong film. Everything was just well done. Great writing, directing, acting, and the list goes on. Good use of the original material but with a little unique take on it. Actors all did great and the characters felt full and memorable. It may or may not be your type of movie.. but was an enjoyable tale and really well done."
"3472","The Hunt",9,"No One is Safe","This movie is an equal opportunity offender and it's hilarious. It pokes fun at everyone and says ""don't worry you can laugh, even if it's at your own expense"".I think the controversy around it makes it even funnier because I didn't find anything to be offended about in this movie because it's a satire, it's saying things with a wink and making fun of the characters saying these things. (I think anyway).Betty Gilpin is great in this and she really knew what movie she was in.It also has a way of keeping you on your toes especially at the start and was kind of refreshing."
"3473","The Hunt",8,"So much better than expected","It took me a while to watch this based on reviews and all the political nonsense, but I am so happy I changed my mind. One of the most entertaining movies I've seen in the last year. While there are political undertones and references, they're not over played and it adds to the entertainment. I highly recommend this movie. It's good for some laughs, and isn't light on the action."
"3474","The Hunt",8,"True to the adage: 100% of Americans think 50% of Americans have lost their minds.","Much more enjoyable than expected.The beginning of it is funny enough, but it is the ensuing few scenes which are riotously HILARIOUS and make it worth watching- I literally laughed until I cried.Toward the middle of the film, there is a wide gap where the laugh-out-loud moments are slowed and further and further apart, but still bring a smile or giggle here and there. The ending while good, is overshadowed by a preceding fight scene that is one for the books. It was really, really well done.The best part of the entire movie though, and what makes it stand out, is that if a person watching has more than two brain cells, the dialogue is spot-on close-to-perfect in mocking BOTH SIDES of the political divide. And here, is what I think people are missing: NEITHER side is depicted as being 'better' than the other. Or worse. It has fun at the expense of everyone and it doesn't do it in any overtly mean way, but in a way where we can nod and nod and nod and laugh ... at ourselves ... no matter who we are or where we stand.Lastly, a horror film - it is not. Somewhat gory, yes. A ""horror"" film? no.7.6/10"
"3475","The Hunt",9,"Fun flick. Such a surprise","I went in thinking I'd hate this movie but turned out loving it. The lead character is well written and Betty Gilpin pulls her off amazingly. Never saw this actress in anything before but will try and find her other movies."
"3476","The Hunt",NA,"An Example of a Good Idea Gone Bad by Typicality","The movie starts Great, twelve strangers are kidnapped and then hunted by a group of rich people, simple plot, normal acting, fast paced, unpredictable, funny and fun. All in the first exciting 15 mins.Then all of a sudden nearly by the middle of the movie it slows down...gets redundant, annoying and very predictable by the over used dull yet unrealistic hero character type, the type that knows it all, never fails and will accomplish anything. Beside the fact that it was falsely classified as horror and it has nothing to do with this genre! The dramatic plot is ridiculously idiotic, the reason why behind the film is completely unbelievable and unrealistic, the fighting scenes were lame as they lack any logic or credibility due to the hero never fails concept. Not to mention, the extremely stupid and predictable ending which was spotted a mile ahead.Sadly this is a vivid example of a Great chance for a change and a feature that could've been unique which sadly turned into a wasted time and bad experience caused by all the wrong choices made by the filmmakers."
"3477","The Hunt",9,"Simply hilarious.","I'm not sure all the people that gave bad reviews even seen this movie or they are just plain miserable. Some have just read too much into it. It's a fun dark humoured movie with a bit of gore that doesn't take itself seriously. You moaners need to get a life and not realise that not every movie has to be analised to see if its black/white or red/blue or rainbow. Enjoy it for what it is. FUN. If not then watch The Waltons on a loop."
"3478","The Hunt",8,"A rare gem these days - an excellent horror movie","This leans much more towards satire and black comedy style of horror.
Quite surprisingly good! A battle royale between the ""elites"" vs the ""deplorables"". I really liked how the filmmakers played around with the concepts of our current political zeitgeist, and its a lot of fun to see how they play with it, and provide a satiric commentary in the movie, targeting both sides. Both sides take hits, and also learn they have misconceptions about the other, and gain a newfound respect for their ""enemy"". A rare horror gem with wit, satire, smarts, and fun at the same time. The ending I absolutely loved, and thought it was exactly how it should have been."
"3479","The Hunt",9,"A deplorably liberating conservative satire executed like, wow!","Take a hint, my title is satirical, as was this film. Anyone finding the need to pick a political side from this film needs to give their heads a shake. This was pure mindless entertainment, and writers Nick Cuse and Damon Lindelof nailed it! I want/ed more! Directing by Craig Zobel was excellent. Casting was perfect, and both Gilpin and Swank delivered. Despite the awesome violence and gore, in the end, it's just a feel-good movie, comedic in nature, as one bad guy after another gets what everyone in the audience thinks they deserved. The critics got this one wrong - they either took it too politically, or had their neck-ties on too tight. A definite recommend from me, and a well deserved 9/10!"
"3480","The Hunt",10,"Better than Invisible Man!","Based on the 6.4/10, I wasn't expecting this to be better than Invisible Man, but I couldn't have been more wrong. The movie is very funny and Deep Blue Sea-esk in that a few well-knowns are the first to go. Betty Gilpin's expressions set this satire-gore-story apart from them all."
"3481","The Hunt",7,"Good fun and brave levels of dark humor","It had similar vibes of Ready Or Not, ideas and themes of The Purge and the unpredictability of The Cabin In The Woods.
The first act is pretty strong and it really throws you off course as to who you think the main protagonist will be. That just set me up nicely for not having a clue of where it could go next.
It moves at a good pace, the violence is brutal but cartoonish in its execution, the gags are solid and go down brave but potentially dangerous routes. I was fine with them. But it wouldn't surprise if some might offend the SJW cinema-goers.
While the end was the most formulaic part of the film. The journey getting there made it a worthwhile watch."
"3482","The Hunt",10,"Thoroughly enjoyed it.","I thought the movie was great. Original and humorous. And while political stances were used to set up the plot and some of the humor, I think that's all it was. I didn't see any political message or anything so I suggest just giving it a try even if you are sensitive to such things. The one argument I can understand against this movie is about it's classification. Those looking for a strict Action, Horror, Thriller might be disappointed to see it's unserious and humorous nature. I would describe the nature similar to The Cabin in the Woods if you've seen that."
"3483","The Hunt",6,"The message...stop trying to find a message in everything!","This movie was written to basically call everyone an idiot if they base their whole lives around politically based ideological garbage. It's saying that regardless of being far right or far left you're still basically the same breed of moron and that it's the people living in the middle, who are actually trudging away just living our lives, are the actual badasses. Well not me specifically, but the general ""we"". The people who ignore the extremes of politics and just get things done. This movie portrays that in the least subtle way possible and I thought it was pretty hilarious.There is almost no plot to this movie, which I'm sure will turn people off, but that's honestly what I liked about it because as commentary it speaks to political discourse that we see every day. It's all crap on both sides. Just buzz words and stupid conspiracy theories with both sides trying to paint each other into a box with very specific ideologies. Then we have the protagonist, a woman we know nothing about, nothing is ever explained about her, and she just takes over everything. It's all a very hamfisted analogy for modern society but I thought it was hilarious.The plot is dumb, the characters are disposable, you never know what's going to happen next, everyone is insulted by the end, and Betty Gilpin does a hilarious job of just being bizarre. She also shows off some of her skills she's developed from starring on GLOW and her body is crazy tight in this. This is overall just a silly, ridiculous, popcorn flick with gratuitous violence...which is exactly what we need in an overly charged political era. It's a 6 because it's no masterpiece or anything, but it's plenty enjoyable."
"3484","The Hunt",10,"This is pure satire","This movie strikes right into our educated, full of reason, polarized minds - which we all have. And it's funny. Just don't miss it"
"3485","The Hunt",9,"The pig in the poster is named Orwell. There's good reason for that.","Oh boy this is fun.""The Hunt"" had preview screenings tonight, and I am SO glad I went to one. I have not been this entertained by a movie in a long time.Originally scheduled for release late last year, due to media spin about a movie most of the complainers hadn't seen, Blumhouse Productions delayed the release, while they waged a quiet counter-campaign.They were right, to do so. This movie IS NOT what the hue-and-cry suggested it is. To be sure, ""The Hunt""is about political leftists hunting political conservatives (aka: ""Deplorables"") for sport, but this is satire; tightly scripted, brilliantly executed, and with every trace of polemics themselves lampooned for dark...very dark...laughs.""The Hunt"" is above all funny. If you have the sense of humor for it. It is also grisly; filled with flying body parts and graphic violence worthy of the horror movies Blumhouse is rapidly becoming famous for. But all of that is in service to political satire from which no point on the spectrum escapes unsoiled.Best of all is the direction. Delightful twist follows carefully delivered surprise again and again. And just when I though I had the algorithm figured out, Director Craig Zobel gently pulls the rug, and I laugh at myself for thinking I could anticipate any of it.""The Hunt"" is rated ""R"", and it earns it. As I said, the violence is graphic and real. The language is as legitimate as angry people arguing for their lives, and their beliefs.I would not say that the movie gains any special benefit from being seen in a theater, but I have a feeling this film is going to be a HUGE hit, and if you wait for a home release, you may experience people spoiling it for you. At the very least, you will be an outsider, listening to people rave about ""The Hunt"".I give it nine stars.Nine very shiny stars."
"3486","The Hunt",10,"Great fun! Takes shots at BOTH sides.","This movie was great! I went in not expecting too much, and preparing myself for a political ""preaching to"". I was soooooo pleasantly disappointed. This movie was non-stop shocks and fun from start to finish. Politically, it takes very clever and hilarious shots at both sides of the political spectrum. I really expected it to be slanted to one side, which I worried would annoy me; it didn't. It was tons of fun. No matter your political affiliation, if you can't take a joke aimed at being either a liberal or a conservative, this movie is not for you. However, if you don't mind EXTREMELY clever jokes made at the expense of both sides, then you'll love this movie."
"3487","The Hunt",9,"see this flick !","This is bloody, and bloody funny, and whip smart.
Dang why all the snowflakery, ? Both sides are made fun of so just sit back and be entertained.
Betty Gilpin ROCKS this movie and Swank is stellar (is she anything else ?)
Great fun, it must have been a blast to make."
"3488","The Hunt",10,"Excellent thrill ride","I can't believe the hate, great action flick. The film swerved into Some interesting themes and pokes fun at all sides of the political spectrum. It's an edge of your seat wild ride. Not an amazing work of are but supremely entertaining."
"3489","The Hunt",10,"10/10. Absolulely EPIC Movie. Top 100 of All Times!","This is undoubtedly, one of the greatest movies I've ever watched. Didn't see the trailer,just read the announcement and saw the poster. I knew it would be great after just 5 minutes.
The script, the jokes, the hidden messages and peculiar play. This is brilliant. The script writer is a genius.
I will admit, this is not for everyone and I am not sure who this movie is for, probably for someone who can think, perhaps?? There's so much behind each dialog!!!
I don't want to spoil it. This is definitely a comedy-horror(ish gore)-thriller-action type flick. If you are into that sort of stuff, there's a good chance you will enjoy it. I can see myself re watching it again in a couple of years. The last Star Wars, which I watched recently was horrible and boring and I wasn't sure if anything can redeem my fate of movies and this one really did.10/10. Best movie of the year for me!"
"3490","The Hunt",NA,"Actually pretty good","I know that none of the bad reviewers even watched this movie. It's not really a left or right movie but it shows how bad both of those sides are and the hero actually seems to be like most of us, somewhere in the middle. I hope people will give it a watch before passing judgment on it."
"3491","The Hunt",8,"A True Satire In Every Sense Of The Word","I'm not sure a film has ever had to traverse a rockier road to get to audiences than ""The Hunt"". Scheduled to hit the cinema in late-summer of 2019, it was pushed back due to its subject matter supposedly clashing with a number of political/social events at the time (almost a bit ironic considered the film's overall message). Then, after finally getting a March 2020 release date, a pandemic hits and shuts down all theaters, forcing the movie to be released digital-only. Throughout that winding road to viewers, ""The Hunt"" gained a negative reputation as subversive or dangerous in politically-charged ways, as well as featuring a satirical tone that is potentially off-putting to those either unwilling or unable to look beyond its surface level. While I would 100% agree that a film like ""The Hunt"" doesn't tackle political/social matters in a way movie viewers are used to, it does provide an interesting treatise on the current social landscape through the lens of political stereotypes and biases.For a very basic overview, ""The Hunt"" sees 12 strangers suddenly and inexplicably thrown together out in the middle of nowhere. The initial confusion quickly switches to terror, however, when they realize they are being hunted (presumably for sport) by others. Through a series of conversations and flashbacks, viewers learn that the hunters are your stereotypical ""liberal elites"", while the hunted are the ""conservative, red state"" types. But are things really that simple?The thing I would stress most to anyone watching ""The Hunt"" is to always remember that it is satire at heart. There are groan-inducing wisecracks as people are blown to bits, and cringe-worthy lines of dialogue abound. But that doesn't make ""The Hunt"" a bad movie! I wonder if perhaps the satire genre is a bit of a lost art form in that people now expect movies about social/political themes to be life-or-death serious. I'm as big of a ""heavy drama"" fan as anyone, but that isn't the only way to tackle those subjects. Here, the model is to set up a basic Blumhouse Productions film strategy (i.e. slightly ridiculous but able to appeal to younger audiences). If made as a sweeping, serious epic, right away more than half the audience base would be cut out from under it.Of course, the above characterization is only this film's surface-level description. Embedded deep within the Damon Lindelof and Nick Cuse-penned script is a surprisingly deft characterization of the current sociopolitical landscape. While at first ""The Hunt"" comically leans into stereotypes, it then deconstructs them and ultimately turns into a compelling treatise on how ""both sides of the aisle"" share the same common problems. One just has to look past the surface-level buffoonery to get there.Perhaps the biggest criticism levied against ""The Hunt"" has been that it simply panders to political stereotypes. In my viewing, that couldn't be further from the truth--again, as long as one realizes the tone is comic/satirical in nature. For all the world this film seems like an exercise in ridiculousness, but there's a reason the pig pictured prominently in the film's marketing is named Orwell.Overall, ""The Hunt"" is a brilliant social/political skewering camouflaged as a cheesy, over-the-top action/thriller. It isn't shallow, by any means, nor is it overly pompous. In these ""all or nothing"" political times, however, it may be odd or perplexing to some to see the issues chuckled at rather than the gnashing of teeth. If you can get past or embrace the satire, however, there are spot-on messages here that will/should make both conservatives and liberals stop and think a bit."
"3492","The Hunt",5,"Blumhouse's Hunger Games","Good: Great idea on paper, yet never fully reaches its full potential and does not fully develop, lacking a full cohesive story. The acting is average all around with Betty Gilpin being the standout of a strong female lead. There is humor to be had, but not much with just a lot of quick quips here and there. The film starts off great, but then fizzles away with pacing issues...Bad: The writing is messy, and the middle drags. The story just does not add up to much and lacks depth and production.Overall: The movie tries to be political but never quite works out. The advertisements and political uproars are unnecessary. The film has a unique idea, but the low budget world does not come together.2.5/5"
"3493","The Hunt",10,"Loved this flick!!","I've been waiting so long to see this and I wasn't disappointed!! Lots of action and lots of on the edge tension! Betty Gilpin is great!! Honestly loved!!"
"3494","The Hunt",7,"Anything but Anti Conservative propoganda lmao","The witt with this movie comes from the fact that the smart ones play stupid and the stupid ones play smart. Imagine The Hunger Games with a bit of Hide and Seek. And that's what this movie is. The liberals play the bad guys, and the conservatives play the good guys. Which was anything BUT how the right wing media outlets portrayed it as. The acting from the protagonist Betty Gilpin is one of the best things about this movie! She took her role and absolutely ran with it. Where the film does fall flat is from it's extremely predictable plotline. Which copies from various thriller films made in the past. Overall I liked this movie! It was dark comedy with a strong politically charged twist."
"3495","The Hunt",8,"The first really fun film of the decade.","The Most Dangerous Game, Deadly Prey, Hard Target, The Condemned, Manhunt: hunting humans for sport has been done to death in the movies, but not since Turkey Shoot (AKA Escape 2000 or Blood Camp Thatcher) has it been so unashamedly gory and so much fun. In addition to providing the viewer with plenty of over-the-top violence, The Hunt delivers a healthy dose of scathing social satire, making it a hugely enjoyable way to spend 89 minutes (the perfect run-time for a film of this ilk).The film sees twelve strangers waking up in a wooded area with no idea how they got there. Making their way to a clearing, they discover a crate full of weapons, but no sooner have they armed themselves than they find themselves under fire from their abductors - a group of rich liberals who have selected their prey for their 'deplorable' conservative views. Unfortunately for the hunters, one of their unwilling targets, Crystal (Betty Gilpin), is a highly trained servicewoman who isn't too chuffed about her predicament.From the opening assault on the abductees, which is chock full of cartoonish gore, to the wonderfully executed, lengthy and very brutal final fight scene between Crystal and Athena (Hilary Swank), the leader of the liberals, The Hunt is pure fun. The playful script by Nick Cuse and Damon Lindelof delivers a few neat surprises regarding the nature of some of the characters (although we never do find out whether Don is 'in on it'), while director Craig Zobel displays a lot of flair for both action and comedy - I sure hope we'll be seeing more from him soon (fingers crossed that the Corona virus doesn't kill this film's chances at the box office).I know there hasn't been a lot of competition (Cats, Sonic, Fantasy Island, Brahms, Birds of Prey-hell, even The Invisible Man disappointed), but The Hunt is easily my favourite film of the year so far. 8/10."
"3496","The Hunt",10,"I Like Dystopian Satire with Pointed Sarcatic Humor. This film fits the bill with a cherry on top!","I enjoyed this satirical movie with its exaqggerated commentary about something truly delusional and ridiculous in today's America. I confess that I share the outlook it paints about today's ""Deplorables"" and ""Elites."" I have already risked being banned by Facebook, ""unfriended"" by friends, family, and acquaintances alike, having profusely (and profanely without swearing) commented on its insipid divisiveness.I found this film's premise to be inspired, although I mean inspired by the contemporary dystopian, highly classed societies depicted in the ""Hunter Games"" and ""Divergent"" franchises, and movies such ""The Island"", other influential mythologies from the past concern displayed through exaggeration can include ""Logan's Run"" and its age as class stratifier, Orwell's ""Animal Farm"", and more parallel with the new (1995) Outer Limits' Season 4 (1998) Episode 2 called, perhaps coincidentally, ""The Hunt"". The discrfiminating factor in this society to have their ""deplorables"" hunted by the ""elite"" is that they were androids who had become sentient, but since they were ""only machines"" they could be killed for sport. Even that resembles an older P. K. Dick's ""Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep?"" which was of course immortalized for the deplorables amongst us who cannot or refuse to read, as ""Blade Runner,"" with young Harrison Ford and Rutger Hauer as examples of the two sides of their statistical discriminating universe of ""right to live free"" or ""right to kill for having such a ridiculous desire.""This movie is an indirect comment on this appalling situation, and given Hollywood's inherent stance within the movie's antagonist ""elite"" commuity, it is no wonder Universal delayed giving a voice to the ""deplorable"" protagonist population (some ""deplorables"" are math, philosophical, computer science, environmental, technology [... &c.] visionaries having already made the ""elite's"" presumptious and unwarranted manifest hubris a great and natural and inherent source for its obvious and gratuitous , and makes an obvious source of ironic material for the screenwriters.Here one will find guns and violence as the exaggeration of something that should remain ideas and words. Stratifying and separating classes into the ""deplorable"" prey vs the hypocrite ""elites"" hunters exaggerate something that should be a mutual growth of shared ides. Even though this film was easy to write, some will feel it ""needed to be said"" in another voice and others may predictably and regrettably wonder what the point is."
"3497","Scoob!",5,"It's OK...but could have been so much more.","The first 15 mins of this are great. Why they couldn't have just kept this as an origin story of how the gang met and started solving mysteries is beyond me. Instead the story spirals off into a million directions and is filled with tons of poorly executed pop culture references. The animation is stellar, but the plot diminishes this one a lot. I'm not expecting it to be just like the TV series, but my kids got more excited at the beginning of the movie and started to lose interest as it went on. Sometimes I wonder if these screenwriters working on kids movies actually have kids. So disappointing and a big missed opportunity."
"3498","Scoob!",4,"A generic 21st century kids movie disguised as a Scooby Doo movie.","I was never really the biggest fan of Scooby Doo. I watched some epispodes, but I never really gravitated to that show and characters. But even with watching so little episodes, you can tell it is very different from the cartoon. It doesn't feel like Scooby Doo. There aren't any mysteries of haunted houses. This is a superhero movie wth Scooby Doo characters.The villian is actually pretty good. He has a clear motivation and you understand what's he doing and why he's doing it. He can also be funny which is perfect for a kids movie like this.The voice actors did a good job. The stand-outs for me are Mark Whalberg, Jason Isaacs and Frank Welker.The movie is really funny and a lot of the jokes land well. Especially with the character of Fred. Whenever he's on screen he gives that funny vibe and you can't help it but to laugh whenever he tells a joke.The biggest problem for me is that this is just a generic kids movie. It follows the same formula as all kids movies. Set-up a relationship with two characters, seperate them and make them reconcile, earn the power of friendship and save the day. On top of that, add a bunch of pop songs. The movie is afraid to take risks and shake things up. Because that, it doesn't add anything new to the genre, it doesn't add anything new to the Scooby Doo characters and it's just forgetable. If i'm in a mood for Scooby Doo, I won't watch this. I will watch the original cartoon. If I'm in a mood for a 21st century kids movie, I won't watch this. I will just go watch the Lego Movie. My point is that this movie doesn't stand out in any way.I conslusion, I don't think that a generic kids movie is worth 20 dollars.4/10 you can skip it, you're not missing much."
"3499","Scoob!",6,"It Was Total Nostalgic Journey But Sadly The Mystery Part Was Missing","It doesn't matter what age we are when it comes to Scooby Doo it was, is & always will be a must watch. Now if you're following the Scooby-Doo animated / Cartoons series or movies then you already know how cross overs are common & Scoob is no different you'll see other Characters from Hanna-Barbera such as Blue-Falcon and his Dog , Dick Dastardly from Wacky Racers as the main Antagonist alongside Muttley with a Cameo providing you the total nostalgic journey especially if your 90's kids or older. Film follows how Scoob and the gang met when they were children's following the Scooby-Doo theme song 'Scooby Dooby Doo Where Are You? We Got Some Work To Do Now' with same picturization as we've seen in 90's.
The Movie is set-ed in modern times where you'll find IKEA , Netflix's jokes along with Insta & Selfies.
The major weak point about the movie was the mystery part as when it comes to Scooby Doo there has to be a ghost, ending with that iconic removal of Face Mask following 'Those Meddling Kids' but sadly you wont see that this time and that's Sad Very Very Sad."
"3500","Scoob!",1,"Where is the real scooby doo?","I realize that Scoob is basically a kids' cartoon generic movie. I realize that I am long past the target audience's age. However, I grew up a fan of the original Scooby Doo cartoon. I was 4 years-old when the cartoon originally aired and I have fond memories of those Saturday mornings. The people responsible for making these new movies have taken most of what made that show good and thrown it out the window. The ghosts and monsters weren't real. There was always a rational explanation behind everything that went on. Part of the fun was trying to wrap my 4 year-old brain around how the bad guys were doing their evil deeds. But a movie based in anything approaching reality wouldn't work as a big, over-bloated, CGI mess like SCOOB. It's unreal, it's loud, and it leaves nothing to the imagination. The film consistently makes fun of itself in that I'm-smarter-than-you, self-referential way that I find so annoying. It's a shame to me that young kids today will not grow-up understanding the charm of the original Scooby Doo."
"3501","Scoob!",5,"Scooby Doo, from the makers of Trolls","Did not have the classic Scooby Vibe. Trying to hard to be hip. Mystery Incorporated cartoon was so much better."
"3502","Scoob!",1,"Beware This is NOT Scooby-doo!","For those hoping to watch a fun origin story of scooby doo or maybe a fun giant epic mystery adventure film, unfortunately this film misses that mark. What you should expect to see is another average CGI animated cliche and extremely bland and predictable super hero film. This film tried to accomplish too much during its runtime, that is ends up accomplishing nothing!"
"3503","Scoob!",3,"Cute and Nostalgic For the First 15","This movie dies after the first 15 minutes. It starts and it's super cute and actually resembles Scooby-Doo. But then it just goes off the rails. It has stupid cameos, pop culture nonsense like dabbing?? It was so basic. The plot was just nonsense and boring.I don't love the animation style they look like they are made from each plastic and the voice acting is kinda off putting because for the most part non of the characters sound like any incarnation of them from the past which is strange as some of the old cast members spoke about wanting to return and were disappointed not to be asked.My other complaint is there want really a main monster to fight against it seemed to randomly pop up in the end. It just didn't seem like Scooby-Doo"
"3504","Scoob!",1,"Scooby Doo, We haven't found you.","This movie was horrible, took Scooby Doo and turned it an ""Emoji Movie"" it has references for the older fans, but it takes the charm of Scooby Doo and turns it into a bad children's movie. Why have today's kids grow up with Scooby Doo being this way ? It was truely a disappointed. Keep the fans of older Scooby Doo and keep us out of it. Don't put references of the originals in something that isn't Scooby Doo at all. Its basically a whole different movie with the Scooby gang pasted into it, and that's just the appearances with new personalitys. Shouldve made this movie with the original animated Scooby Doo movies in mind and it would of been great..."
"3505","Scoob!",1,"Where's the ""heart"" ?","We have come to love the cast for the last decade. Why take the heart out of the movie? Will Forte doesn't do Shaggy justice. The suspension of disbelief is gone with the cast of mystery inc. I want my money back"
"3506","Scoob!",1,"Disappointed","I'll be honest I was extremely DISAPPOINTED with this film. I won't be watching this movie again and I'm a bit mad at myself for wasting money on renting such a mediocre animated film/ story. Completely kids eye candy at best , nothing more here ."
"3507","Scoob!",2,"The usual sausage.","Another CGI 'product' that chucks out all of the charm of the original in favour of contemporary post-modern gibberish and self-referential jokes that do nothing but make all of the characters smug and unlikeable. I wish this was a cartoon. I wish it had a spooky mystery at its heart. I wish it was Scooby Doo."
"3508","Scoob!",5,"An Identity Crisis for Scooby-Doo","I can see what they were going for by crossing over with other Hanna-Barbera characters, but in doing so, I think that they stripped away a lot of what makes Scooby-Doo so great. I was always drawn in by Mystery Inc's skepticism to all things supernatural and as a child, I felt that I could dip my toe into something spooky but the humour and adventure would balance it all out. Even in this film, snippets of the gang's spooky hijinks were the highlight for me and without that - I feel that there is no Scooby-Doo. In saying that, the animation was beautiful, I do love these characters and I think that Zac Efron was a perfect casting choice for Fred. I feel thankful that this has gone straight to streaming rather than a wide theatrical release, as I can only hope that a new generation finds a better entry point into Scooby-Doo rather than this film."
"3509","Scoob!",4,"Animated trash","I loved Scooby-Doo cartoons as a child, so I expected similar impressions and feelings from this animated film. There were also hopes that this franchise will still be able to revive. But, in my opinion, this is not the case at all.The plot. Nothing interesting here. Classic thrash plot of the last 10 years. Metal minions.... for me, this is an indicator of the lack of ideas in the writers of the cartoon.For fans of cool graphics it is a disappointment. 2020, but the film doesn't exactly reach the level.The main characters infuriated me more than forcing me to empathize. Especially Fred - a dumb-headed beauty.Jokes? I smiled only once. The complete primitive.Attitudes of children... My nephew, who was watching with me, went to another room 15 minutes after the start of the cartoon. It simply didn't interest the child, and this can already be called an indicator.4/10. Children will not be interested, adults don't need to waste time."
"3510","Scoob!",1,"CGI Garbage!!","Not the Scooby-Doo we all know and love. This is a ""spin-off"" of the franchise / series. Very flashy CGI garbage! The plot is EXTREMELY predictable, even for young kids. Everything about this film is just bland and boring. Not very interesting movie. Maybe VERY young kids will find some interest in the bright colors and characters goofiness. Don't recommend buying the ""home video release"" of this ! Not worth the price ! Wait for this to be on rental, or just watch a free scooby-doo episode or movie online for free !!"
"3511","Scoob!",2,"Awful...just awful. I mean unless you want millennial Scooby-Doo.","Gone is the 60s attire and tone and music that has been a staple of Scooby forever, replaced with awful 2020 setting and music...and no, I'm no boomer.
This movie sucks. It's not a ""prequel"" like advertised, and they've turned the characters into freakin caricatures of themselves with a millennial twist. For some reason they felt the need to make Velma into a Spanish girl who switches into speaking Spanish like Dora the explorer. Why not just add a new character to the team instead? It's not like they haven't recruited other people temporarily before. It's just seems like unnecessary pandering. I also don't understand the Simon Cowell thing...weird.
The other thing that really bothered me is that Scooby talks a LOT...like abnormally so, and in full sentences too. That is not something I remember seeing in anything previously and my kid watches a lot of Scooby. I don't care for the 2020 plot setting either...they use cellphones and hashtags and stuff. It just feels so not Scooby.
Whole I'm at it, Fred looks weird and they made him into essentially Homer Simpson or Peter Griffin level of stupid. Also Will Forte voices Shaggy and it's pretty awful...he sounds nothing like him. None of these things are helped by the awful plot either."
"3512","Scoob!",2,"All jokes missiles missed the laugh target...","Very disappointing movie. I was expecting so much more from it. It looks like scriptwriters were inspired by TikTok rather than by original series. If you were as ""lucky"" as I was and have seen the Emoji movie, then it is approximately on the same level. Trying hard, but nor reaching the point. Very wired for the young generation and too modern for old school viewers."
"3513","Scoob!",NA,"if you want a Scooby movie, this is not it","It started well, with a touching scene of the main characters meeting for the forst time as kids (or puppies, in Scooby's case) and then having one of their traditional adventures. However, this only lasts 15 minutes, and from there the movie stops being a Scooby Doo movie and starts being a superhero movie, with Dick Dastardly as the supervillain, and Blue Falcon and his gang as superheroes, with the Scooby gang stuck there in a movie that is not their own.Because let's face it, just like in a James Bond movie we have certain expectations, in a Scoob movie we also have expectations, and they are not met. That distinctive type of adventures where they explore a haunted location and, after many scares, end up discovering that it was all a not supernatural trick by some criminal, is not here, except for a brief nod at the beginning. Instead, we get a generic modern children's movie, with characters running around from chase to chase, battle to battle and explosion to explosion without a compelling plot, while making pop culture references. The plot involves saving the world from a large-scale supernatural threat (really supernatural, none of the subversion characteristic of the source material).So, if we forget about wanting a Scooby Doo movie and focus on the movie we get, it's not very good either. You can see where they try to have jokes for the adult watchers, but they lack the wit and talent to make them funny. They occasionally remember that this is supposed to be a Scooby Doo movie, and they have traditional gags like having Scooby and Shaggy, in the middle of being chased by the critters, turn around and serve the critters as waiters, disconcerting them for a while, but it's too little and done without much talent. You also get a scene where two male characters fight and a female character says it's toxic masculinity, which is kind of a hateful message to send to children.In short, if you want a Scooby movie, this is not it, and if you want a generic modern kid's movie, this is not a good one."
"3514","Scoob!",1,"Subpar","This film is subpar at best. Not very entertaining unless you are 5 and under. The character cameos are from super old cartoons. The Scooby doo plot theme is missing here. This film is such a MESS! Skip it! Wait for redbox or just watch an old scoobydoo movie on TV!"
"3515","Scoob!",1,"STUPID MOVIE!","This movie is just random and bizarre , makes great eye candy for small children, but that's about it! No storyline , no great performances , animation looked cheap and plastic . I have seen WAYY BETTER ANIMATED MOVIES! Skip the high prices on this one!"
"3516","Scoob!",1,"No good!","This movie is just a series of events, with really no cohesion at all. I guess this is what happens when they just want to make something to collect easy revenue. It's just unfortunate that they writers didn't really care about the movie."
"3517","Scoob!",5,"TOO MUCH GOING ON","Just too much going on in this movie and it really is missing the Scooby Doo feel. It wasn't bad and it wasn't great it was ok. Casting Tracy Morgan as Captain Caveman really felt like an insult to the character. Just not a fan of his... does he even have fans?"
"3518","Scoob!",6,"Solid Entertainment for Today's Meddling Kids... and Then Some","This will probably be the entry in the Scooby-Doo franchise that is going to equally divide its audience, with each side giving its own valid reasons. Some viewers are going to appreciate the modernization of the story, while others will wish it had stayed in the late 1960s. Some are going to get a kick out of the pop culture references, while others will ask themselves why they are in a Scooby-Doo movie. Some will appreciate the superhero theme, while others will forget that Blue Falcon and Dynomutt have existed in the past. Some will recoil at the childish crude humor, while others may giggle at it. Some longtime Hanna-Barbara fanatics are going to love the tie-in with other characters, while others are going to call it a forced attempt to kick-start a shared universe. It'll be very interesting to see how the overall consensus falls, and it'll also be up to the individual to form its own opinion. At the end of the day, it's a kids' film. That's the best anyone can say about it. It does what it can to introduce this franchise to a younger generation through those quirks and contemporary computer animation, while at the same time, it does have enough weight in the story and aims closer to the source material than more recent attempts, even when it doesn't always digest easy. It'll be up to you to decide where this lands. Obviously, it's more focused at entertaining today's kids than being a great entry in the Scooby-Doo canon. However, if it connects with the long-time meddling kids that grew up with the characters for over half a century, then it has definitely earned its extra Scooby Snack points."
"3519","Scoob!",6,"Missed the mark with the voices.","Not a bad movie but I don't know why you would choose to make a Scooby-Doo movie and not include Matthew Lilard, Grey DeLisel and Frank Welker. It's just a marketing ploy using bigger names and sacrificing quality for money. Still worth watching but could have been a lot better."
"3520","Scoob!",1,"Horrible","I've seen every scooby-doo movie out there and all the Tv series . This is the worst. I was really looking forward for this for months and I'm so glad I didn't waste my time at the theaters for it. If you're a true Scooby-Doo fan you'll know it doesn't have any of the elements like the other ones."
"3521","Scoob!",1,"Lame & disappointing!","Totally not what I was expecting from a Scooby-doo remake ! This was more like an kiddy action film with Scooby doo characters in it! Pretty lame and disappointing for adults and older audiences . If you have very young kids and don't know about Scooby-doo, they will absolutely love this, otherwise , SKIP IT! It's not what you are expecting it to be! Totally different concept of Scooby doo in this film."
"3522","BlacKkKlansman",7,"BlacKkKlansman","Amazing true story of a small team of police infiltrating a local klan chapter to try to stop looming violence.Driver is first class as the white undercover presence, with Washington himself oozing presence throughout as the black officer who conceives the plan, runs the show and in a number of hilarious high points gains the respect and trust of the big Klan chief over the phone.Whilst there is arguably room for a little bit of trimming, this remains highly engaging throughout with a great script and fine performances. The amazing trick here is how Lee seems to very cleverly shift from laugh out loud comedy to troubling sometimes fairly intense scene and back without missing a beat."
"3523","BlacKkKlansman",8,"Totally Recognizable Villany","A terrific Spike Lee film with humor and gut wrenching truths. My first reaction was that the villains were too one dimensional, caricaturesque. It was impossible to stay with them for more than a few seconds - even that outrageous scene of connubial bliss where she expresses her willingness, in the most romantic terms, to kill Blacks. I recoiled in horror and kind of laughing nervously - what is this, a satire? And then, I realized - the real life villanis are one dimensional, they are caricaturesque, they are their own satire. John David Washinton is great and sounds just like his father. Adam Driver brings a presence that is nothing short of compelling, The final real life images are devastating, I highly recommend it."
"3524","BlacKkKlansman",8,"One hell of a movie","Spike Lee has created an almost unimaginably uneven career in films, but it has never been in doubt, that he is one of the most talented American filmmakers of his generation. And should you have forgotten that, now you can remind yourself by watching the amazing ""BlacKkKlansman"", which won the Grand Prix at Cannes in May.""BlacKkKlansman"" tells the true story of a rookie African American police officer who in the 70's infiltrated in the KKK, but that's certainly not what the movie is about. Lee tackles head-on the contemporary hot topics of racism, the police killing black Americans, and white supremacy to create an overwhelming pamphlet about the American identity - which has been hurled into a state of great confusion after the last presidential election.Movies don't come much more political as this one. In a way, ""BlacKkKlansman"" is a companion piece to ""The Post"" - a movie that similarly discussed the current political climate in a 70's setting - but with loads more of blackness, humour, anger and attitude. It's a better movie, too.Though not perfect. Form-wise, ""BlacKkKlansman"" is sometimes paced oddly and feels needlessly long: not overlong, exactly, because you're not going to be bored for a minute. Visually it could have used a little more of the delicious textures typical of those 70's blacksploitations it makes references to.But Lee is such a virile storyteller, that you can't help but get sucked in it all. And he has SO much to say. ""BlacKkKlansman"" is at its savage best when putting in perspective the official holier-than-thou image of the white Americans: Harry Belafonte cameos as an eye-witness of the beastly lynching of Jesse Washington in 1916.Actors in ""BlacKkKlansman"" are great. John David Washington excels in the lead role. Adam Driver signs what is arguably his best role to date. Ryan Eggold is terrific as the local boss of the KKK, and the Finnish Jasper Pääkkönen impresses as his right hand man. The biggest surprise of all is Topher Grace, who is near-ingenious as David Duke, a well-mannered bag of sleaze in a three-piece.""BlacKkKlansman"" is an incredibly rich and stirring piece of contemporary cinema with enough stuff to fuel a conversation for hours. Or days. You can get a lot less with a price of a movie ticket these days."
"3525","BlacKkKlansman",6,"Incredible true story comes with a lot of fictional baggage","There's much good about this movie, starting with Ron Stallworth's incredible deception of the Klu Klux Klan. Racism in all its ugliness is powerfully shown. There's a lot of humor at the expense of some really dumb people. 
Unfortunately, there's a lot wrong with the movie too. Most of this is because the director embellished the true story. I'm not a big fan of directors tinkering with what really happened in order to add their own touch, and then still claim ""based on a true story"".
The result of the tinkering is a very uneven movie, particularly in the apparently ""easy"" parts of infiltrating the KKK and the ""hard"" parts where things go wrong. The ""easy"" parts are, remarkably, mostly the true story. Apparently this wasn't dramatic enough, so a lot of fictional ""hard"" parts were added to build tension including whole characters and situations. That's bad enough, but the added parts often made no sense, such as having no real origin (like one character's intense suspicions) and no resolution to the dilemma presented - they just seem to go away, are forgotten or have no effect on the inevitable story arc. Many seem to have been thrown in only to make already duped people look even more ridiculous. 
The characters themselves are, with a few exceptions, just caricatures. It's not hard to figure out what's next since they do exactly what you expect.
Eventually the movie just got boring since it all moved to an inevitable and very easy to see end. Ultimately, the movie is maybe an hour of an amazing true and humorous story marred by over an hour of superfluous and poorly executed fiction."
"3526","BlacKkKlansman",8,"A movie with a powerful and relevant message","BlacKkKlansman is a movie about Ron Stallworth, an African-American detective, embarking on a mission to infiltrate his town's chapter of the Ku Klux Klan. BlacKkKlansman did an amazing job in conveying a powerful message to the audience. Spike Lee creatively balances humour and seriousness in BlacKkKlansman, which I thought was amazing. Also, the acting was incredible. I thought both John David Washington and Adam Driver delivered an amazingly convincing performance as Colorado Springs police officers. The story was also great, although this movie suffers from minor pacing issues which slowed the movie down a tad bit. Overall, I think BlacKkKlansman is a movie that is very relevant in today's day and age, and everyone should get a chance to see this movie."
"3527","BlacKkKlansman",8,"A funny, gripping and upsetting movie!","Hi, I'm french and I'm 16. We saw the movie in the cinema with my english class and our english teacher asked to us to write a revue of this movie, and after put in on this website.
Blackkklansman is a movie birected by Spike Lee in 2018. This film is based on the true story of Ron Stallworth, a black police officer who wanted to infiltrate the KKK. Inspired by the book, Spike Lee made a film. In the movie we have funny moments and romance too; Ron falls in love with Patrice, a beautiful blanck woman who fights racism. It is certainly at the top od my list of good movies because it is not only about racism, but about several kinds of discrimination, anti-semitism and gender inequality. And so I think that a lot of people can indentify to both characters and realise that discrimination must be fought. And I think that Spike Lee did a good work because hemanaged to make in making a comedy with a dramatic issue, and Adam Driver and John David Washington have a really good actor's game, it couldn't be other actors!
So yes I think that this film is compelling, convincing, realistic, startling and funny, don't miss it!! And there is a lot of reseach from the film director about the KKK, who is a secret organisation of white supremacists directed by Donald Duke and created in 1865 after the Civil War, a war between Northen and Southen states of the USA, the North wanted to abolish slavery and the South didn't. In the movie, we can also see the KKK rites, with the white costums and all tradition. I really enjoyed that because you get out less stupid than you were before seeing the film.In conclusion, it's a fantastic film, with good actors on the top of that, and you learn a lot about discrimination and humanity, but with funny moments as well. It's a hit and a freat piece of film-making. Go see it!!Good work, Mr Spike Lee.Valentine B."
"3528","BlacKkKlansman",9,"BlacKkKlansman is somehow funny & utterly brutal at the same time, phenomenal.","I'd love to thank the Adelaide Film Festival Film Club for the free advance screening for this review.Blackkklansman comes to us from Director Spike Lee & Producer Jordan Peele and tells the true story of Ron Stallworth, the first african-american police officer in Colorado Springs infiltrating the Klu Klux Klan.To achieve this he enlists the help of a fellow officer played by Adam Driver to pose as him in person while Ron handled the phone calls and planning. This film is biographical in nature but has some fantastic storytelling, looking at the trailers, it looked like a really fun time with some funny humour about the time period and racism.
I'm glad to report this isn't just some comedy movie, here we have a rare film that manages to be funny and outlandish at times but at the same time drives home a serious emotional message, Spike Lee should absolutely be commended for this because it was executed flawlessly. John David Washington gives an interesting quirky performance here and nails it perfectly, Adam Driver turned out to be much more involved in the story than I had anticipated and has some really great moments.I have never had a cinema experience quite like this, for instance at the tail end of the film, in the space of 10 minutes the entire audience in my screening went from laughing and some perfectly executed comedic dialogue to utter still silence in absolute awe, frozen & horrified by what was appearing on screen, this silence went on for a few moment even after the fade to black and an applause started up. This film had me thinking about what I had seen for a long, long time afterward and I am still thinking about it almost every second.Blackkklansman really shows the Klan for what they really are, and highlights the good work of an amazing african-american police officer. The supporting cast does a great job here, Topher Grace as David Duke was an insanely good performance and I can imagine how hard it would be to embody that particular character and Laura Harrier plays off of Washington beautifully.In addition there is a great cameo at the beginning of this film, be on the look out!Blackkklansman is easily in my top 10 for 2018 so far and I urge you all to go see it in cinemas, small warning though, there are some quite confronting images in this film, they are hard to watch but I think that it should be watched as that is the intention here.
Blackkklansman is out in cinemas August 17th."
"3529","BlacKkKlansman",4,"Changing major facts for no reason","We are living in extremely polarizing times when it comes to race relations. This film is based on a true story about a white man and black man working together to tackle a hate group, and that would have sent such a powerful message. Instead, the white guy's race was changed. And as a fan of the original book, I'm just left scratching my head. And it helps to nullify the dynamic between a white and black person working together; in other words it explains why the first two thirds of the film seems a little boring and almost like filler."
"3530","BlacKkKlansman",6,"Not Best Picture worthy at all","Every year I make a point of watching each of the Best Picture nominees for the Academy Awards before the ceremony airs. And every year I'm astonished at some of the films that are considered to be the ""best"" of the previous year. 'BlacKkKlansman' is a prime example of this. Is it a bad film? No. Is it a good film? Sure. But is it a great film and one of the eight best released in 2018? Not in this lifetime. Sadly I understand a lot of politics come into the Oscars and I think that is a large part of what is at play here. This is a heavily politically driven film that tugs at the heart-strings of just the right type of people that dominate Hollywood and the Academy. For that reason it gets a nomination. Not because it is a great film.Adam Driver has been nominated for Best Supporting Actor at the Academy Awards as well. This was also a baffling one to me. His performance is good and highly watchable, but he never blew me away by any stretch of the imagination. I kept waiting for him to be given one big scene he could really shine through and knock the audiences socks off with, but it never came. A really bizarre nomination from the Academy I would find it extremely surprising if he got the win for this reason.The film was actually very similar to the 2016 film 'Imperium' starring Daniel Radcliffe. Obviously it didn't have the twist of a black man being behind the infiltration, but a lot of the actual person to person undercover scenes were very similar in nature. I think I enjoyed that film more though because it was more interested in telling you a story, instead of ramming a view down your throat. I also thought the real-life footage shown at the end of 'BlacKkKlansman' was cheap and out of place. A very tacky decision by Spike Lee to throw that in there. I miss the days from the 90s when if a film was nominated for Best Picture you could be assured it was a truly brilliant film. This film doesn't even compare to those."
"3531","BlacKkKlansman",6,"A Powerful Message that Gets Unfortunately Forced on the Audience","Spike Lee's films have never really resonated with me for whatever reason. BlacKkKlansman is a fascinating story with an average execution at best. Lee brings some solid performances out of Adam Driver and John David Washington, but I'm not sure those characters are fleshed out as much as they should be. But my problem doesn't come with the actors or story per say, but more so with the message that is shoved down your throat. The very beginning and end of this movie present a particular message that is prevalent throughout the film on its own, without the book end scenes. It's a powerful message and reminder for our country, which is still going through its own version of the racism shown in the movie. Perhaps more subtle directing and a better 3rd act would have given this a higher score.6.4/10"
"3532","BlacKkKlansman",5,"Can I put bad review and not be labeled as racist?","NO SPOILERS! But seriously can I put bad review and not be labeled as racist? FIRST! I did like acting power from most of the cast (really good job), it was filmed in appealing style, and it had its funny moments. So why 5 stars? 1. Biggest reason is how this movie was adverted. I went to cinema with absolute different vibe and expectations and because of that I could not enjoy movie right after 15-20 min when I felt it isn't what it tried to sell me. 
2. Movie did not bring anything new to the table. It has solid (really good) acting, but it seemed like I'm watching cut-scenes from different movies and put together.
3. It has bad mix between comedy and serious parts. Maybe jokes are too rare or to plain, but it makes you struggle to understand what was directors intentions? 
4. End scenes (this is kinda spoiler, so will not say what was in it) felt really biased and ruined last bits of movie, because it felt too much out of place. It made me feel like all what trailers wanted is me to spend my money and see end scenes of directors views.I don't mind more political movies, but I felt tricked and movie itself wasn't that good. I don't want to spoil movie, so I would have more to say, but then it goes in discussion of certain scenes."
"3533","BlacKkKlansman",4,"Disappointed","I will echo what others have thought about this movie....totally disappointed. After reading glowing reviews and now the movie is up for major awards, I can't help wonder -- WHY? What did those critics see and hear and feel that I didn't. This movie was a snooze and made no sense in its chronological eventing of how Stallworth went from a PD records clerk to an undercover cop. I didn't smile or laugh and feel this is a total fail for Spike Lee. I see the movie made money, glad for that, but honestly, it's a dullard."
"3534","BlacKkKlansman",2,"Cliché Upon Cliché Upon Cliché","The sad thing about the present spate of Hollywood social commentary-infested movies is just how utterly predictable all of them are: once you know the subject matter you know the message, and once you know the message you know the movie you're going to see.I wanted to hold back on my initial suspicions to give this film the benefit of the doubt, but there was no real reason to - it's a Spike Lee film, and there's a bunch of black people in it: you therefore know what it's going to say and how it's going to say it. You know how every black person's going to behave and you know how every white person's going to behave. And of course they do.John David Washington can act, but his character, like all the other characters, is little more than a cartoon stereotype, this time with a wig on his head that looks like a microphone pop-shield. The 70s period detail kinda looks like a live-action Scooby-Doo, and the hysterical race war politics crammed into every human interaction with a crowbar kinda resemble something Shaggy might have come up with after too many Scooby Snacks at an Elijah Muhammad rally.Spike Lee is not a good director, and has never BEEN a good director: he is incapable of telling, pacing and selling a believable story, and his most celebrated works are little deeper and more developed than the average rap video. The only half-entertaining movie he ever made was Inside Man, and I wish he'd go back to the drawing board and learn how to make something like that again. Something with recognizably human characters in a plausible narrative, and at least a little sprinkling of surprise."
"3535","BlacKkKlansman",9,"International viewer review","Its really comes down to ""Art"" while presenting such topics from history to modern world . A big round of applause for director and script writer for bringing this story to life !"
"3536","BlacKkKlansman",1,"Sadly over-the-top","Spike Lee must be cash-strapped to make a movie these days as he obviously had to pander to certain elements to get this farcical adaptation onto the screen. The over-the-top representation of the differing elements in the story made it farcical and unfortunately laughable; whereas a more serious approach to the issues and the people involved would have made viewing this film more legitimate and a reasonable approach to a troubled history."
"3537","BlacKkKlansman",3,"Disappointing","This was a real disappointment. It's such an important topic on race and history, and it a unique setup, but Spike Lee's quirky style undermined anything of real significance here. I can't believe such an intense, fascination story felt so boring and uninspired."
"3538","BlacKkKlansman",10,"One of my favorites of the year","I just left the theater and feel obligated to write my first IMDB review. This film is very well balanced, it easily switches between serious and funny moments. The plot, dialog and acting all come together to make a cohesive movie. I was very impressed with the main character's acting, at the time I did not know it was Denzel Washington's son. This film has substance yet was hilarious as well, it understands that a serious subject matter can also be entertaining at the same time."
"3539","BlacKkKlansman",2,"An Anti-Trump Rally or A Story of An American Hero?","A remarkable story was to be told; however, Spike Lee got in his own way time and time again inserting modern political references in a story set in the 1970s. The cast was fantastic, but the movie was so drawn out to tie together a political agenda rather than a hero's story. It's a shame, a disappointment and a let down. I feel like there was so much more to be garnered from the actual story than Spike Lee's political views. Too bad the story wasn't more focused on the actual events. It seems like there's was so much more for the audience to know about Ron Stallworth."
"3540","BlacKkKlansman",3,"Yawn","Surprisingly dull, predictable and full of the stereotypes it should be dispelling."
"3541","BlacKkKlansman",4,"Let down by pacing issues","This story is a brilliant story to tell! The cast is a fantastic cast! Washington is perfectly cast, Driver is in his element, Grace is a diamond in a gold mine. 
Spike Lee is the person that should be telling this story, but the movie suffers from pacing issues. The comedy it relies on is scattered sparsely. I found myself tuning out in moments and not wondering what I missed"
"3542","BlacKkKlansman",9,"Brilliant, Sad, Scary and Funny","This movie really took me by surprise; not so much Spike Lee fan- the dialogue in this movie is often times so shocking that it was jarring. The texture captures perfectly the 70's vibe and shows a side of America that has been long hidden. The story is compelling, and it does what great movies do- they linger with you long after they're over and make you think and rethink what you saw. As Spike Lee said ""Don't be afraid to laugh"""
"3543","BlacKkKlansman",1,"Lee is just not a good filmmaker","The lead actor was so boring and wooden and when he added some energy he sounded just like his dad, Denzel.The film was so forced with themes and scenarios, but in a really bad way and totally over done. Lee always had a student film quality to his films. A bunch of caricatures.The approach to the subject was flippant. It almost was done like Undercover Brother. The writing was horrible. Using language from today instead of authentic speech from this period and when they do it's always ""right on brother"" and ""brother this and brother that."" Lazy writing.So painful to watch. And what's with the constant head-on shots?It's supposed to take place in 1979, but the design, wardrobe, hair etc look like it was in the late 60s and early 70s. Just another phony movie that didn't get it right."
"3544","BlacKkKlansman",4,"Can't really say its worth the watch","I came into this movie with high hopes because the acting list seemed strong, and had a good story to bring together racial tensions that have been dividing Americans more recently. But am sad to say, the pacing of the movie seemed a little dull, camera shots didnt have enough versatile angles, and the way the whole movie was written out is kind of like all the other movies of this kind lately, just about Black Power, which of course isnt really a bad thing in itself, but this story wasnt meant for that, its about a white and black dude working together to stop radical racism.. I felt this movie does not help show the true meaning the book meant to entail, and instead ran off the key terms that every movie has concerning topics like these, White man bad."
"3545","BlacKkKlansman",5,"Mediocre at best","I do appreciate the historical value that some good movies are able to provide while at the same time also combining quality cinematography with superb acting performances through the portrayal(s) of historical figures. But this film does not provide a balance between fine acting and historical documentation. No, what this film provides in my humble opinion is a very left leaning political message.Adding insult to the intelligence of the producers/directors intended audience is the fact that the film also included actual film footage from the August 2017 clash between white nationalists and counter protesters and how each party blamed one another and the police for the violence that erupted in Charlottesville, Va. I am not objecting to the actual footage included at the end of this film, only that it displays an obvious clear bias that one party is racist and violent and that this film only encourages the continuation of hate amongst races based on either the color of one's skin and or choice of religious faith.As for the acting in this film Adam Driver's performance stood out, but I was less than impressed with either Topher Grace's role as the Grand Klansman David Dukes, or by John David Washington's performance as Ron Stallworth, an undercover cop. But what I was most disappointed with was the screenplay itself which was so one-sided that the audience was expected to believe that the civil rights movement origin was formed by the Walt Disney Mickey Mouse Club.For Spike Lee to receive an Academy Award for best Director, the year 2018 must have been a very lousy year in the entire film industry. The Academy members were obviously attempting to appease one group for the previous year's/decades of exclusion of the top awards but I expected to see much more from a film that received six (6) Academy nominations. Instead, all I gleaned is frustration from another film in a long line of politically motivated films that wreak with a one-sided view of a suppressed society. I don't call this entertainment at all. This film's only success may be in re-energizing the continuing divide amongst the nation."
"3546","BlacKkKlansman",5,"A movie you have to like to not be called a racist?","I'm not white or black, and I'm not American. I guess this allows me to see the film in a very neutral, unbiased perspective, and to judge it based on its own merits rather than the political issues surrounding it.When I watched the trailer, my impression was that the movie was going to be hilarious, probably a subtle, lighter take on a heavy subject, with a strong ending that sends the right message to the audience. That was my expectation of the movie. Since it also ended up as a nominee for Best Picture at the Oscar, I expected a really good, solid movie that deals with the subject of racism in a unique, creative way. Instead, what I got was a dragging movie full of cliches, uninspired dialogues, and in-your-face message before the credits rolled.I was left underwhelmed and very disappointed. Not only that the movie was such a drag, I didn't like how one-sided and stereotypical it was. I think the reason this is so highly rated is because people are so afraid of being labeled ""racist"" for not liking the movie. That, and the political views that it projects, some people want their views to be validated. Pardon me, I'm a person of color and I didn't enjoy the movie."
"3547","Uncut Gems",8,"Spot on reviews here lol","All reviews here are correct. The good ones and the bad ones. This movie is a mess and you can like it or hate. My wife hated it, I liked it very much."
"3548","Uncut Gems",10,"Absolute Insanity","Saw this at TIFF. From front to back, this movie might be most stressful thing I've ever seen. I was a huge fan of Good Time and this movie ramps the intensity to an even higher level. Sandler's performance is great. It just shows that time after time, if he's working with a good director(s), a strong supporting cast, and an interesting concept, he will absolutely crush it. Also what other movie could have ""people watching sports"" be the most exhilarating part of the story?I also loved that the score (Daniel Lopatin aka Oneohtrix Point Never) is used super strategically to build discomfort, especially when it swells to drown out the dialogue.Looking forward to watching this again when it gets a wide release in December."
"3549","Uncut Gems",8,"""You're the most annoying person I've ever known""","They should hand out high-grade blood pressure meds to people going to see this after it ends. The major strength and in a way the slight weakness of Uncut Gems is how laser-focused the Safdies are in conveying total anxiety, stress and mania through this extreme act of full cinema SOUND (levels of acting and over-lapping dialog, that Vangelis-Blade-Runner-on-Steroids/Crystal Meth score, some of the cinematography and the tracking of the camera).I do wish there was a little more than just flourishes of relief, though I'd be lying if I said Sandler was anything but exceptional and riveting playing degenerate crumbling right before our eyes. While Eric Bogosian, Lakeith Stanfield and Kevin Garnett and many others here are natural solid, it's Sandler's show, and it's soulful and tense and harrowing and ultimately (as terrible as Howard can be) tragic. The filmmakers's greatest achievement from the looks of this and Good Time is finding star-actors who aren't known for their wide range and getting career-triumph work from them. If the movie isn't all that complex, I do think Howard is and that helps make this pretty special as a depiction of addiction, more than anything else. It's got grit and style to burn, which is mostly fine by me."
"3550","Uncut Gems",9,"Not a Sandler fan!","I am pretty sure this would be an Oscar nod for Sandler.
One thing I can say for sure is that I have never been a Sandler fan. I have deliberately avoided his movies all along - I never liked him on SNL.
But boy did he break all my perceptions of him in this gem!
This is not a movie to watch in cinema for sure. Watch it at leisure at home with possibly taking a break or two in between. It is intense and will draw you in."
"3551","Uncut Gems",4,"A stressful convoluted mess of nothingness","How is this even a movie? For starters, who's idea was it to have a constant loud, atrocious, out-of-place and annoying score in almost every second of this film. Then putting a bunch of loud people in one room yelling, ignoring each other and talking nonsense, and call it a movie. This is the garbage daily workplace stress people want to avoid, not watch expecting to be entertained, but instead resort to drinking to settle down watching this stressful convoluted mess of nothingness. What was even the point of the traditional dinner with still non-stop annoying loudness and useless chatter? I get the writers are novice/newbs, but at least have a seasoned writer proofread this mess before it goes to action and viewers watch stunned for 135 mins wondering what they're watching, only to get a stupid ending. 4/10 all going to Sandlers great performance"
"3552","Uncut Gems",3,"Yelling Characters Over an Abrasive Soundtrack","I went into this film with fairly high hopes for it. Yeah, those hopes died about ten minutes in. Everyone is yelling in practically every scene, and there's a strange, vaguely 80's sounding soundtrack blaring in every scene. The first two acts are a mess, though the third act is a bit easier to follow, but ultimately doesn't offer all that much of a story. So, to sum it up, I'd rather watch 'Billy Madison' while getting dental work done than this trainwreck of a film."
"3553","Uncut Gems",1,"I got a headache!","Wtf is this? Why the high ratings?
It's 135 min of pure noise!"
"3554","Uncut Gems",3,"Watch if you want to get headache!","The only interesting thing about this movie was the constant high stress levels. Other than than, garbage story which ended meaningless. I'd rather watch Adam Sandler's cheesy comedy movies that this."
"3555","Uncut Gems",1,"Waste of time","The first 15 mins are just pure mess with characters yelling over each other and horrible music in background. The whole story doesnt even make sense at all. At the end you are happy that is finally over."
"3556","Uncut Gems",4,"What did I just watch?","Uncut Gems was every bit as thrilling and chaotic as it seems was intended. The shouting dialogue and impulsive plot kept me on the edge of my seat, but the entire thing felt one note until the very end. I certainly wasn't bored, but I don't think this was a roller coaster I truly enjoyed."
"3557","Uncut Gems",1,"The whole film is like a phone keep ringing but no one answer it.","Really annoying! Everyone keeps yelling in the whole film, a lot of scenes make no sense. I don't know how this can be called a film and got this high rating. Unbelievable"
"3558","Uncut Gems",1,"Relentlessly annoying","45 minutes was all I could bear, that was more than enough, 45 minutes of shouting, poor direction, ridiculous script, annoying soundtrack, terrible acting. Anybody who rates this movie seriously needs to have a long hard serious look at themselves.
I carnt believe Scorsese had any involvement in this shambolic episode
ABSOLUTELY DIRE"
"3559","Uncut Gems",1,"Yelling, chaos, no storyline worth following","I have only walked out of one other movie in my life. I was trying to stick it out through very chaotic and gritty scenes hoping that the movie would get better. 20 minutes into the movie, my husband said, it better get better than this or we should just go home. Sad to say, we made it about an hour in still hoping.This movie was one of the worst movies I've ever seen. You don't want to root for any of these characters. They all seem pretty horrible as people. There is no humor. The movie has a lot of chaos, which creates almost an anxious feeling, and it just because people are constantly yelling or obnoxious.I didn't enjoy anything about it and left, wasting $20 because watching reruns on tv was the better option."
"3560","Uncut Gems",1,"Pure Obnoxious Chaos","I literally can't think of a worse movie than this one.Nonstop Screaming. Nonstop chaos. Nonstop fighting.I'd rather be at the DMV for 10 years than live through watching this garbage again."
"3561","Uncut Gems",6,"To be honest.......","This movie on of weirdest movies that I have ever watched .. Sometimes you feel it's great and hopefull then after 5 seconds you feel the movie fkd up and go to wrong way with loud shouting and screaming .. It deserves 6/10
By the way Adam sandler was great in drama he should leave comedy for a while and focus on drama now"
"3562","Uncut Gems",1,"Total Chaos... Every scene","I go with the honest & truthful reviews posted here - I felt like I was in an argument throughout the movie with a narcissistic sociopath and the level of chaos throughout every moment of his life was awkwardly uncomfortable - I only watched through to the end because of some strange past enjoyment of Adam Sandler's movies.... Just been shouted at for 2 hours and feel drained!"
"3563","Uncut Gems",2,"Yelling is not acting","Yelling is not acting or my kid is Al Pacino, annoying score , poor performance by most of the staff, annoying score, easy to figure plot twist , annoying score, over the top hectic yelling and screaming scenes, annoying score."
"3564","Uncut Gems",1,"One noisy mess!","I was intrigued to see Adam Sandler take on a serious role, what an anti-climax that was. I would say he should stick to comedies but he hasn't done a decent one in at least 10 years.The directors relied on music to create atmosphere because they couldn't create any otherwise.Zero character development to create any kind of tension. I couldn't figure out Sandler's character, if it was a terrible portrayal of charismatic or he was genuinely meant to be stupid. You couldn't like or dislike him. He has the intelligence to trace a priceless gem but displays zero intelligence to sorting out his problems, even how he talks with people, it's like putting Billy Maddison in the middle of Goodfellas. Just bizarre.Though I thought the 80s esque score was actually good, it was wasted in the hands of this movie's creators. Used beyond excess to compensate for the lack of substance.They tried to create a complex plot out of the simplest idea. It becomes this mess trying to chase the suspense it never finds."
"3565","Uncut Gems",1,"Oh dear","Two hours of people just shouting. It's absolutely awful. Zero likeness for any of the characters and a non story. Worst film I've seen for years. Sandler needs a good talking too."
"3566","Uncut Gems",1,"waste of time","Not worth your time. Total waste of your time,. Movie is a mess"
"3567","Uncut Gems",1,"Horrible story","This was so disappointing. Ratings were high so went. Nothing redeeming here. Bad story so-so acting. Adam Sandler should stick to comedy."
"3568","Uncut Gems",2,"Too shouty and the music track is awful.","Managed about 10 minutes of this mindless shouting over a terrible synth soundtrack. Everyone needed to knock it down by 50% to make this watchable.Had to pass before my head exploded."
"3569","Uncut Gems",3,"Most overrated movie ever?","Sandler is a good actor and pulls off the non-comedy role - but what a sad depressing film. Yeah, yeah - certain reviewers will give this positive reviews because of ""realism and depth"". I call BS - why watch a movie about a train wreck main character that continues to denigrate throughout the movie. There are enough true life problems in the world - don't want to spend my entertainment time not being entertained.If you are down and want to be depressed - this movie is for you."
"3570","Uncut Gems",1,"I felt assaulted. This movie is much worse than just bad or waste of time and money","Wish I had left immediately but I was with someone and had to suffer through to the end.. This movie sucks. It was so painful to sit through that even my ears hurt. I was in a nice, clean theater with fancy comfortable recliner seats, but it was misery. I felt so grubby afterwards that I wanted a shower.The worst movie I have ever subjected myself to in nearly 60 years"
"3571","Uncut Gems",1,"One of the worst movies I've ever tried to watch","No storyline. No redeemable characters. Poorly written, if anything was written at all. Literally a show about nothing. If you like a million f bombs for no apparent reason other than the lack of any substantial dialogue, then this is you gem! I can't believe I lasted an hour, and felt much better after leaving. The people I was with all left as well. Total garbage of a film."
"3572","Shakuntala Devi",4,"This is not a biopic","Bollywood doesn't know how to make a biopic; or maybe they don't care as long as they're making money. Direction: The plotline is incoherent, seems like it is taken straight from Wikipedia. The movie just shows events happening without reasons, no story following up to the events. We rarely understand the mathematical genius that is Shakuntala Devi, because there's very little story to it. Much of it is just unnecessary melodrama centring around a mother-daughter relationship.
This movie is an insult to one of the greatest India has ever produced. ACTING: Vidya Balan is at her worst, partly because of a lack of plot and tries hard to compensate for it. She's over enthusiastic invariably, grins all the time - something very different from the actual Shakuntala Devi. She's not jovial, she's creepy.Also, why does a biopic need so many songs? What a waste of effort and purpose.P.S. They added components of feminism to garner postive reviews."
"3573","Shakuntala Devi",1,"Worst Movie","Whats wrong with bollywood??? Without any masala they cant make a biopic? Misson Mangal was ruined with same drama... Why everything have to be so dramatic? Learn from ""The Man Who Knew Infinity""
Not watching this movie will be a real tribute to Shakuntala Devi."
"3574","Shakuntala Devi",2,"Tribute to the legend is not watching the movie","Typical Bollywood masala movie. Overdramatic and bizzare script. Just like Bollywood ruined mission mangal they have successfully ruined the movie. At least the makers would have watched the man who knew infinity. Poor script and direction. Acting of Vidya Balan and all others except Santa Malhotra is top class."
"3575","Shakuntala Devi",2,"90% Bollywood drama 10% biopic","This is not what you call a biopic. Bollywood doesn't know how to make a biopic rather they show same old drama, over acting, their own fictitious story. They did same Mission Mangal. Watch it only see mother daughter relationship"
"3576","Shakuntala Devi",1,"An absolute horror show","What a horrible biopic of such a great personality it turned out to be, vidya BALAN just didn't fit in and the masala treatment given to the movie is too much to bear, indian audience is all grown up, we can watch a movie without dances and cliché drama scenes.."
"3577","Shakuntala Devi",5,"Pure Vidya Balan's show!","After a back to back disappointed Direct Digital Release from Prime Video looks like we kinda have the better one. Still, not the best!Shakuntala Devi works only when you consider this as a pure Bollywood entertainer instead of looking it as a movie based on a real life person. The movie gets most of the things wrong, that's why the makers haven't claimed this to be a Biopic. Still, I felt they went too much with the ""creative liberty""Vidya Balan as Shakuntala Devi shines in a few moments but also wasn't that convincing, I'm not saying the performance was atrocious. Felt it was more of a ""mothers & Daughters"" conflict tale than the portrayal of a Mathematical genius.Sachin-Jigar's music was okayish. Keiko's Cinematography and the color grading of the film was aesthetical and it went quite well with the layered narrative. The 127mins seems really long, especially after the first half of the movie. That's when the monotonous feel hits.To sum up Shakuntala Devi is yet an another Bollywood Melodramatic Movie with the label of ""Inspired by the true events."" And definitely not a Re-Watchable worthy!"
"3578","Shakuntala Devi",1,"What rubbish","Steer clear of this movie. Overacting, nothing sincere, absolute nonsense. At your own risk."
"3579","Shakuntala Devi",2,"Disappointing","Shakuntala Devi is an iconic woman in India and arguably,in the international realm too.She was a very strong personality and most famously had batted for LGBT rights way back in the 1970s.She was very vocal and upfront about her opinions.Thus,I expected atleast a part of this persona to be conveyed in the Amazon movie.Vidya Balan as the lead was an added bonus.However,not only does the movie dilute the central character to the extent that she becomes cartoon-ish but it also fails to present a coherent narrative.It's mildly infuriating to see the kind of disservice the movie does to the real Shakuntala Devi.Vidya Balan seems to be stuck in the ""Tumhari Sulu"" world of a bubbly,cheerful middle aged woman who is always 'very happy'.The makers have tried to marry the Tumhari Sulu character with some elements of western musicals and it's just...odd! The other actors are decent in their roles.However,the weak writing and the overall disconnect of the movie's Shakuntala Devi with the real one pull it down.The movie is an avoid unless you are a huge Vidya Balan fan."
"3580","Shakuntala Devi",2,"Injustice to Shakuntala devi's character by an insipid and flat Vidya","Vidya Balan has given the worst performance in her career. The movie could have been very interesting and at par with 'The man who knew Infinity', but for Vidya Balan. The role should have been done by Kangna, who would have done justice."
"3581","Shakuntala Devi",8,"INGENIOUS","#FinalVerdictShakuntala Devi proves the adage 'There is no great genius without a mixture of madness' right. A terrific film that stays in your heart, remains etched in your memory and restores your faith in Hindi cinema. Bravo!Brownie points to Anu Menon-Nayanika Mahtani's dynamic script, Ishita Moitra's razor-sharp dialogue and Antara Lahiri's crisp editing. It is a women's show all the way. Moreover, you cannot draw parallels with any other film. Vidya Kasam!Shakuntala Devi blends drama, emotions, humour extraordinarily... the icing on the cake being Vidya Balan and Sanya Malhotra's towering acts. The writing holds the spectators' interest and doesn't let you digress from the screen, except for a few minutes.If Vidya Balan is the driving force on screen, it's director Anu Menon who stands out with a near-perfect film. The concept of Shakuntala Devi is oven-fresh and the handling of a number of sensitive and dramatic moments is noteworthy. Director Menon smartly integrates the songs in the narrative, although, the film would've excelled even without songs. The songs (Sachin-Jigar) are situational. Cinematography (Keiko Nakahara) captures the vibrant colours adroitly. Director Anu Menon balances the rough and smooth incidents in Shakuntala Devi and her daughter's lives beautifully. The culmination to the film is novel. Karan Kulkarni's background score is perfect. You'd have a new phrase to chew on this time: 'Vidya Kasam'.Shakuntala Devi is unimaginable without Vidya Balan. She can handle the comic sequences with as much flourish as the emotional ones. She is absolutely ravishing. Sanya Malhotra's appearance, mannerisms and dialogue delivery are exemplary. Amit Sadh is excellent yet again. Jisshu Sengupta registers a strong impact. Luca Calvani, Adi Chugh, Sheeba Chadha, Nyla Masood, Prakash Belawadi, Neil Bhoopalam and Purnendu Bhattacharya lend able support. Seher Aly Latif's casting is a lesson indeed and how!On the whole, Shakuntala Devi is a must-watch for every parent, every child. A remarkable motion picture with an overwhelming message!"
"3582","Shakuntala Devi",7,"A Highly Loud and Dramatic take on the life of an Extraordinary Woman.","SHAKUNTALA DEVI (2020) REVIEW
.
.
<U+0001F4DC> Plot: The extraordinary life of Shakuntala Devi elaborating her dominance in mathematics and life as a mother, narrated through the eyes of her daughter Anu.
.
.
<U+0001F468><U+200D><U+2696><U+FE0F> Review : Shakuntala Devi seems like an overcooked , highly dramatic and loud representation of a genius mind who has led an extraordinary life. This movie highlights her spirits of being ambitious and conquering her own dreams with the help of numbers. For Bollywood its not new that a simple straightforward biopic has turned into a colourful , dramatic and a movie filled with fictional events to make it worthy watch for Indian Audience.The Movie seems to start quite decently but tends to fizzle out. Considering the performances , Vidya Balan is extremely brilliant who sinks into the character just like her own skin. I can imagine no one in bollywood who could have pulled off such a character with wits and charm like Vidya has done. Sanya Malhotra is fantastic as the daughter and has done great justice to her role. Amit Sadh and Jishu Sengupta have limited screenspace but have not disappointed.Overall , The Movie Is Nice for a family weekend watch but in terms of storyline and Shakuntala Devi's life this movie could have been made more inspirational as a tribute to a world famous genius than it already is.
.
.
<U+0001F44D>Goods : Vidya Balans shines through the movie and drives the storyline convincingly. She makes this one watchable.
.
.
<U+0001F44E> Bads : Overcooked with More Bollywood Drama .
.
.
<U+0001F525> Final Rating : 6.5/10
.
.
<U+2705> Verdict : Shakuntala Devi could have done wonders with more inspirational elements but is definitely a watchable drama to experience the glorified life of one legendary mathematician from Indian Soil.

"3583","Shakuntala Devi",8,"An intro course to human relationships and their correlation with the human aspirations and ambitions","What worked:
amazing screenplay and narrative; the movie is well written and executed piece of work. Firstly, I don't know the real Devi so I cannot making assumptions and judgments about whether the screenplay justified the true picture. As a movie viewer, I am actually pleasantly surprised by the movie. Importantly, it's a well edited and visualized movie, which keeps the balance in the narrative. What amazed me is the tone and texture of the movie , addressing the life story and relating it to the human nature, relationships and everything in between. It's not glamorizing the greatness of the character , showing the character as the way she is, a human with ambition and goals. Vidhya Balan impresses in this movie, personally. So I think the whole team is great, especially a round applause to the director and the team.What did not work:
-glorified scenes; I can understand the negativity about the movie, firstly because audience could not relate the real to the reel legend, resulting in disgust and anger in some. The other strong opinion are about some glorified and glamorous scenes to over dramatize the scenes. And some other about the narrative. I might agree with first two to some extend but the later I don't. It's a well executed work personally for me.
Final verdict: recommended, if not for the relativity with the real figure, at least for the movie going experience"
"3584","Shakuntala Devi",8,"Vidya shines in this not so perfect film!!!!","Vidya is terrific as usual. She brings life to the character of Shakuntala Devi. Sanya malhotra is equally brilliant. The film's editing could have been better. One may find fault in the film, but not in Vidya.Suggestion:- Don't judge Shakuntala Devi after watching this film. This is how she was... Fearless, free spirited and totally unapologetic.."
"3585","Shakuntala Devi",10,"Really nice movie about the REAL life of the math genius","Explores the mother daughter relationship in a smart strong way ... The maths genius and her troubled personal relationships throughout her life. Go watch it for Vidya Balan. She shines like a star just like Anu Menon's direction..."
"3586","Shakuntala Devi",5,"Missing the link","Shakuntala Devi.Anu Menon.2020Based on the life journey of profoundly known Human computer aka Shakuntala Devi, the film tries to fit in her 84 glorious years in 120 minutes screen time. The film stabs to touch major life milestones of her life from her genius mathematics career to conflict with her own daughter and to her dilemma in life to her flawed rapport with her husband.But the film fails to bring out her psyche, mental vows and keeps spinning around her analogous achievements throughout. Many of her vital scenes are mere caricaturish portrayal to make it look breezy and to reflect her sense of humor with no depth in it. No doubt Balan tries hard with her accents, body language, hiatuses but still the film lacks in the clarity of thought."
"3587","Shakuntala Devi",10,"One of the best Biographical film.","Very inspirational movie and feel good film. The story is well told, screenplay is good and good performance by vidya balan."
"3588","Shakuntala Devi",10,"Excellent movie","It is fantastic movie and excellent acting of vidya balan.she is a very good actress."
"3589","Shakuntala Devi",9,"India is known for some of the best known stars.","I saw a movie about the biography of Great mathematician Ramanujan which is a British biographical drama film at that time I felt that why Indian does not made such kind of movies?
But you know at last they did and it's a wonderful <U+0001F60A> biography."
"3590","Shakuntala Devi",1,"What a disrespect to the real Shakuntala Devi","First of all this movie is not a biopic. It's just a typical cheesy bollywood masala. These Indian directors don't know how to make a biopic. I was already skeptical about the movie as the director is already infamous for disasters like Four More Shots and London Paris New York. To make a movie about a woman who has represented India on an international level takes skills which the creators of the films lacked. This is just utter disrespect to the legend who made India proud."
"3591","Shakuntala Devi",7,"Disliked such script even if everything fell in place at end.","Tone, Script & Story: A so called story (not biopic) bringing to attention life of genius Indian mathematician Shakuntala devi scripted around her personal (family) life.The thing is getting her name in to Guinness book for being a peculiar mathematician seemed to be the peak instance in her life for a fellow fan like me. The scripting however ruined that for me. Apart from that it's a good watch. I liked how so many of her numbers were particularly favorite, some of them being highlighted in movie.Direction, Screenplay, Cinematography: Justified. Music: Average. Acting: Justified.Final Verdict: Watch it for numerical fun and distant personality of Shakuntala putting light on same aspect."
"3592","Shakuntala Devi",9,"More than a biopic","Its a journey of breaking down stereotypes and finding your own voice. Far from the melodramatic portrayal of a mother in bollywood movies, this is a welcome change.
Mathematicians needn't have boring lives, that's again something new!Vidya Balan steals the show, when she's on screen, can't help but watch her transform from the chirpy young girl to a woman with her own struggles."
"3593","Shakuntala Devi",6,"It is not right to mix personal life and professional life together(6*by debojyoti )","To make matters worse, it is not yet a proper biopic in India.When the spice is poured into the biopic, it goes to a place where it is no longer biopic.A person's personal life grows from a good working life.
The mother-daughter relationship has been given much more importance.Shakuntala Devi's huge achievement is covered even if it is a little bit.The last scene seems more dramatic than the big one.Did you need 3 songs in the film?Makeup and costume are truly admirable.Vidya Balan is just as impeccable as before.But the place of Jishu and Amit has not been given much less?"
"3594","Shakuntala Devi",5,"Ok movie-one time watch","The movie is ok. But cant be called a proper biopic. Most of the humour looks forced."
"3595","Shakuntala Devi",7,"Shakuntala Devi was flawed but filled with brilliance of Vidya Balan.","Vidya Balan, playing the great Human Computer was brilliant considering the movie had many flaws. The first half, or rather the first 45 minutes was all about the equations and her private life which felt a bit of overdone work with quirky lines and a comic atmosphere, rather than being a bit serious.The second half though, filled the void left by the first half. A relation between a Mother and her daughter, in the midst of achieving and following her ambitions was displayed beautifully. The film, which stays determinedly cheerful even in the grey hues of London, although slides into flatness a couple of times.The cast was fine and once again Vidya Balan was great in her performance and was a definite show stealer here.
My Rating : 3.5/5"
"3596","Shakuntala Devi",9,"Shakuntala Devi movie review","Movie is really awesome you love this movie,movie character ,I love vidhya bapan acting but I really love sanaya performance.
She's look acting she is totally awesome in the move ,Amit sad as usual good acting , I don't no this biopic is totally correct or not as compared to real life but I enjoy this movie ,
And I don't understand why people can't low rate this movie ,only one thing which is I understand Thai is this movie glorified India and indans culture .but I have one issue with this movie is this movie is not show vadik ganit triks ,.Again must watch movie"
"3597","Amulet",7,"For horror fans who like their movies weird","It's for fans of auteur horror like Hereditary and The Lighthouse. If you like these movies, like I do, you'll probably like this too. It definitely gets very weird, so if you like horror weirdness then this is for you. It's a 7 or 8 out of ten for these folks.If you mostly like only standard trope horror such as slasher movies and zombie movies this is unlikely to be your thing. You'll probably think it terrible and believe it to be 1 or 2 out of ten film."
"3598","Amulet",4,"A Good Idea, But Too Slow-Paced and Boring","The title says it all. The acting was good, I think the story could have been more interesting, but the low-energy, life-support pace of this movie had me half asleep by the end.I appreciate some art-house, slow-burn movies, but this one fell short.[4/10]"
"3599","Amulet",8,"Very arty, maybe too arty, but that's okay","An abstract horror mostly. Little more context relating the two story lines would be good but it's visually stunning and gets more messed up right to the end. Some of the imagery will be stuck in my head for a while and it's been a long time since a film has done that. Disturbing stuff."
"3600","Amulet",9,"This movie challenges your views on good and evil","This movie deserves a much higher score but I think it is a movie that people have trouble enjoying for at least 3 reasons.Firstly, it takes time and focus to actually follow the plot. It's not spoon feeding you. You have to pay attention and remember events and comments from earlier in the movie. It all ties together beautifully at the end but you have to be able to see it.Second, it takes a huge twist close to the end. If you don't get the plot, you won't like or understand the twist. I like this movie because it's one of those WTF movies that really leaves you thinking about it long after the movie. These are my favorite type of movies so I get why not everyone likes that.Third, I love horror. This is one of the freakiest horror films I have ever seen and I have seen hundreds. This is up there with Event Horizon in terms of spooky/revolting and unsettling horror. But it only comes in small bits. Most of the movie is psychological but here and there it has really great horror moments. Both ""shock/surprised"" horror and also that sort of OMG realization horror where you realize how horrific something is slowly and your eyes go wide.I hope more of you can watch this and enjoy it as much as I did."
"3601","Amulet",2,"A bore.","Extremely unengaging. The plot seems to have no thrust to it. You're just watching at best passable actors wander about, occasionally witnessing generic horror tropes.I'd guess that's a side effect of stretching a 20 minute idea to a 100 minutes but I'm honestly not sure what the 20 minute idea is. I finished the movie, I understand all the events that took place, and I'm still left with a feeling that I didn't get something. It's like they chose to tell a fairly basic story in the most convoluted way possible. I have so many questions about the motivations and inconsistencies of characters and actions.At one point a plot twist happens. There are flashbacks to previous events and all that jazz. I admit to being confused, but only because I don't understand why that's a plot twist. It could have been presented as it really is and would have changed absolutely nothing. In fact it would make more sense that way!Imelda Staunton is great in her very short role and for the 3 minutes that the movie goes completely bananas it is entertaining, but for every good thing in this movie there is a scene that makes you laugh unintentionally for either coming out of nowhere or being done poorly. It's not so bad it's good, it's not entertaining."
"3602","Amulet",1,"What did i just watch?","This is not a horror movie. Its a boring movie. Nothing happens, and its very confusing to watch. The fact that it is so confusing and so boring, just takes out the enjoyment of watching this crap. Dont waste your time with this. Its a complete waste of time."
"3603","Amulet",7,"A movie for adults","If you are looking for a gore feast or have the attention span of a flea this movie is not for you.With suburb acting, story, and production this movies is engaging from start to finish.This film does require you to actually watch it to get the most out of the subtleties through out that give you a sense of the characters conflicts and personalities.All in all a superb film"
"3604","Amulet",6,"Interesting but slow","The people behind this movie got many things right, an interesting story, outstanding cinematography, excellent acting from the entire cast, great atmosphere , and some sickening horror effects. Problem is, the interesting story is slow to develop, and overall much of the movie drags. Too many shots of corrosion and decay, spooky statues and slime, but not enough action. The movie needed to move along and because it didn't , it felt overly long. Secrets and demons, this could have been a cut above your usual horror movie, it's certainly well made, but in 2020 the average audience is going to ask more from a horror film then what this delivers. Worth a one time watch if you stick with it."
"3605","Amulet",1,"Another women vs the great evil (aka men)","Another man-hating film dressed up to look like a horror flick."

"3607","Amulet",NA,"terrible.","The acting is fine but the film in general is unadulterated tosh."
"3608","Amulet",2,"Slow and plodding its way to a nonsense ending.","Extremely slow getting anywhere. Once it does get where it is going, you wish it hadn't. A boring journey. Nonsense made up ideology that goes unexplained completely. Terrible story telling (Direction and writing). Pass on this. You can't say you were not warned."
"3609","Amulet",1,"Nope ( not recommending )","Itd boring makes me sleepy and its confusing. The whole plot doesnt make any sense"
"3610","Amulet",3,"I can't stands no more","The best part of the movie was the spooky sound effects in the first half.
The movie spends way too much time pausing and drawing out simple concepts for dramatic effect. I kept screaming ""Get there!"" in my head.
I made it to 1h17m where I ended up bumfuzzled in the woods and couldn't take it anymore. Didn't even forward to the end to see what happened because I just didn't care."
"3611","Amulet",4,"Not that good, very bad pacing","I love Hereditary and Midsommar and Lighthouse, but this is clearly not on same level. It has very bad rhythm, storytelling is way off, cast is completely uninvolving and their accents annoying. Music and sound were great, ending was somewhat rewarding, but it's done completely anticlimactically, and first hour or so were a true bore.
Even if you are horror fan, you can safely skip this, unless you are completitionist."
"3612","Amulet",3,"Not as good as advertised","I had heard great things about this film and last night settled down to watch it.
What a disaster, I don't know what it is with horror film directors but why do they have to make their films 'arty.'
What has happened to a straight scary horror movie?
This could have been such a good film if it was done as a scary film and not like some student trying to impress their tutor.
All in all it wasn't scary at all, the a ting was good but just good, there was a good story with it but that was it.
Just over an hour and a half of my life I won't get back.
Don't believe the hype, if you are going to watch it keep an open mind and don't read any reviews first."
"3613","Amulet",3,"What was the point of this?...","I must admit that I had hoped for a bit more than what writer and director Romola Garai managed to deliver with this 2020 horror movie titled ""Amulet"". Seems that proper horror movies are starting to be a rare occurrence these days.It was the abysmal storyline that made this movie into a stinking pile of... well, you get my drift here. The storyline was just so unfathomably slow paced, and with virtually nothing of anything of noteworthy interest happening, it just felt extraordinarily prolonged. And it felt more like it was a sentence to sit down and watch ""Amulet"" than it was a movie for entertainment.I will say that the acting in the movie was adequate, especially taking into consideration that writer Romola Garai had virtually given the actors and actresses nothing to work with. Nothing. And the movie had a relatively small cast ensemble, so they had to up their game and really deliver to carry the movie. This failed to be the case, because they just didn't have the material to work with.For a horror movie, then ""Amulet"" was just dreadfully mundane and boring. There was nothing scary in the movie at all. Not even a single, cheaply and easily acquired jump scare. Yeah, so go figure...I will say that the prosthetics were good, and I did like the design of the bat. And the whole birthing thing was actually interesting enough. But these could just do nothing to salvage the train wreck that is ""Amulet"".My rating of ""Amulet"" is a generous three out of ten stars, mostly because there was a good production value to the movie. I managed to suffer through the entire course of the movie, so you don't have to. And as for the ending of the movie, well while it was just so obvious and you saw it coming a mile away, something could be said for that being a classic way of ending a horror movie.""Amulet"" really isn't worth the time, money or effort, and there are far better choices in the horror genre."
"3614","Amulet",2,"boring","Not so bad but borring and slow,,if you have free time and like to take nap while watching movie -why not :)"
"3615","Amulet",NA,"Nice try, but no","Guys...stop. Having a bunch of well-shot footage of forests and obnoxious experimental music doesn't make something a high quality horror film on par with things like Hereditary and The Lighthouse. If that surface level stuff is all you think it takes to make a movie intelligent and masterfully crafted, sorry, but you're not as clever as you're trying to make yourselves sound.There are many things that directors like Aster and Eggers do that make their movies rise far above ones like this, but let me just pick one, and arguably the most important one, THE PERFORMANCES OF THE CHARACTERS. You have to be absolutely kidding me if you're going to sit there trying to tell me that the actors in Amulet were anywhere close to well-directed, maximum effort performances from people like Willem Dafoe and Toni Collette. They aren't just on different floors, they're not even in the same building.I've seen much, much worse than Amulet, and I wouldn't even go as far as to call it a bad film, but I can't think of a single moment where Tomas or Magda made me think ""wow, what a great performance"". Hell, I can't even think of one that made me care about either of them. They're dreary characters in a dreary setting acting out dreary motions to fill up time until the entire effects budget is blown in the last 10 minutes, and yes, the director is obviously TRYING to convey something poignant with this unconventional story, but they just aren't selling it.""Weird + good cinematography"" does not automatically equal a great film.""Having an artistic vision + good intentions"" does not automatically equal a great film.It's a great effort, but it's not a great film. Wait five years to see if anyone's still talking about it, or even remembers that it existed, if you're still unsure about that."
"3616","Amulet",8,"Well-crafted, artfully-directed horror/thriller","Despite its slow pace, this is a beautifully produced fare, with exquisite acting by all three leads and artful direction by Garai. There were a few cringeworthy choices for camerawork (trying a tad too hard for an artsy European feel) but overall, the clever build up, the allegory (if a bit too tody and preachy) at the end was saving graces for what could have been a trope-y wrap up. Very 'Hereditary' ending."
"3617","Amulet",1,"False reviews","Not sure where the reviews came from the movie was pure crap"
"3618","Amulet",5,"Little surprise.","Amulet was a great sleeper for me, and not the sleeper hit type, but the fell asleep 2 nights in a row watching it. I almost fell like giving up on it, because it has a weird start, it tries to blend 2 stories together and the pacing is simply put, too slow for my tastes.As the movie progresses some stuff finally begin to happen, which trust me, was a surprise for me as well and right after that, after that exact moment it decides that it kinda skipped a beat and returns to that incredibly crawling of a movement that it did the entire time. Yet, out of nowhere it has this beautiful and engaging ending, a conclusion far too good for it's own execution, thus in my third night with Amulet instead of falling asleep again, I woke up. Yes, I was awaken by the film and finally I wanted to see more and for it not to end. Because after its runtime I wanted this to be as memorable as it could so I could call it a good investment for myself.So besides that final act alone, mostly, final 3 scenes to be exact, don't expect it to last like 30 minutes of the movie or so, beside that great conclusion Amulet is a movie that could have been great but just like all other such examples, it is not. Sadly there are far too many flaws compared to good aspects of it, so I'll give it a 5/10 because it did manage to bring some new things to the screen but the way it delivered was close to annoyingly boring.Cheers!"
"3619","Amulet",6,"Artsy but slow-paced horror","The movie tries a little too hard to be smart and artsy, and it ends up plodding along at a slow pace at some points. This isn't your standard horror fare, which is a nice change of pace. The cinematography painted the world as a dark, bleak place. But I ended up not caring for any of the characters, and the director somehow made the horrific elements boring as very little happens even after the horror is revealed. The ending, for me, was confusing although a repeat viewing (which is unlikely to happen) may clarify things.This isn't for your standard moviegoer, but for those who like the more artsy films, this may be for you. Just go in knowing this is quite the slow-burn."
"3620","Amulet",5,"An unusual horror perspective of forgiveness and punishment.","*There is no end credit scene *Romola Garai in her feature-length directional debut plus crew brought an unusual horror perspective of forgiveness and punishment. The story sets when an ex-soldier is offered a place to stay in a decaying house. The movie had a weak unfolding narrative, the first hour was so dreadful to watch there was no buildup towards anything and I was so anxious for it to end. I'm going to be more straightforward I was annoyed by the many scenes of the main actor eating, and also touching gross things of the decaying house. I had no such curiosity about why this movie was in the horror genre, and I gave up my expectations due to an hour of not having the right buildup of suspense. I was more disgusted and irritated in the first hour and for a moment I thought it was going to be in my worst movie list but shockingly it turned around.The last 30minutes was so worth the watch and how brilliant the concept of evil was projected. Forgiveness is not a simple word and given the situation, one tries to forget than to forgive even if time won't let you. The way this movie exploits it in those minutes was real and I loved how transparent was the significance of doing anything evil. I'm still upset because no matter how much I loved the concept the first hour needed more captivation and it feels a waste of potential.The composer Sarah Angliss brought a good horror vibe but it was too much. Her music was all over the place and the voice should have been used when it reached a high point and not in the whole movie. Possibly if the movie was as glorious as the ending I could have maybe appreciated the music.The cast wasn't solid enough to keep my attention on the first terrible hour. The only one who was magnificent and sadly didn't have a big role was Imelda Staunton."
"3621","Amulet",2,"Avoid","No thread of a story. Bits borrowed from The Sentinal and nothing more. Not sure what the objective was; failed miserably."
"3622","Gladiator",10,"They said you were a giant. They said you can crush a man's skull with one hand.","Ridley Scott's Gladiator is not a perfect film, I would think that the hardiest of fans, of which I'm firmly one, know this deep down. Yet just like Commodus in the film is keen to point out that he himself has other virtues that are worthy, so does Gladiator the film. Enough in fact to make it an everlasting favourite of genre fans and worthy of the Academy Award acknowledgements it received.In narrative terms the plot and story arc is simplicity supreme, something Scott and Russell Crowe have never shied away from. There has to my knowledge as well, never been a denial of the debt Gladiator owes to Anthony Mann's 1964 Epic, The Fall of the Roman Empire. Some folk seem very irritated by this, which is strange because the makers of Gladiator were not standing up bold as brass to proclaim they were unique with their movie, what they did do was reinvigorate a stagnant genre of film for a new generational audience. And it bloody worked, the influence and interest in all things Roman or historically swashbuckling of film that followed post Gladiator's success is there for all to see.What we do in life echoes in eternity.So no originality in story, then. While some of the CGI is hardly ""Grade A"" stuff, and there's a little over - mugging acting in support ranks as some of the cast struggle to grasp the period setting required, yet the way Gladiator can make the emotionally committed feel - overrides film making irks. Crowe's Maximus is the man men want to be and the man women want to be with. As he runs through the gamut of life's pains and emotionally fortified trials and tribulations, we are with him every step of the way, urging him towards his day of revenge splattered destiny; with Crowe superb in every pained frame, winning the Academy Award for Best Actor that he should have won for The Insider the previous year.Backing Crowe up is Joaquin Phoenix giving Commodus preening villainy and Connie Nielsen graceful as Lucilla (pitch Nielsen's turn here against that of Diane Kruger's in Troy to see the class difference for historical period playing). Oliver Reed, leaving the mortal coil but leaving behind a spicy two fold performance as Proximo the Gladiator task master. Olly superb in both body and CGI soul. Richard Harris tugging the heart strings, Derek Jacobi classy, David Hemmings also, while Djimon Hounso gives Juba - Maximus right hand man and confidante - a level of character gravitas that's inspiring.I didn't know man could build such things.Dialogue is literate and poetic, resplendent with iconic speeches. Action is never far away, but never at the expense of wrought human characterisations. The flaming arrows and blood letting of the Germania conflict kicks things off with pulse raising clarity, and Scott and his team never sag from this standard. The gladiator arena fights are edge of the seat inducing, the recreation for the Battle of Carthage a stunning piece of action sequence construction. And then the finale, the culmination of two men's destinies, no soft soaping from Scott and Crowe, it lands in the heart with a resounding thunderclap. A great swords and sandals movie that tipped its helmet to past masters whilst simultaneously bringing the genre alive again. Bravo Maximus Decimus Meridius. 10/10"
"3623","Gladiator",10,"Great","Gladiator is a historical epic from director Ridley Scott. After being betrayed by the new Caesar, Roman general Maximus is sold into slavery as a gladiator where he rises to fame as a people's champion and finds an opportunity to exact his revenge. Russell Crowe, Joaquin Phoenix, and Connie Nielsen lead the cast and deliver strong performances. Additionally, the gladiator fights are especially dynamic and exciting, featuring several different styles of combat. The costumes and sets are also remarkably well-done, and create a vivid depiction of ancient Rome. And, Hans Zimmer's score does an excellent job at capturing the tone of the film. Thrilling and action-packed, Gladiator delivers a compelling tale. ""Are you not entertained?!"""
"3624","Gladiator",10,"Breathtaking!","Once again, Director Ridley Scott proves to be as professional as one can be. The recreation of ancient Rome is splendid, with all its magnificent buildings and atmosphere and he is able to show with all brightness the greatness of the Roman Empire, with its political problems and military discipline, and love and treason, of hate and jealousy, that still have a place in our world today. But the story has a glow of its own, to which all the beautiful scenery (believe me, it's awesome!!!) and great cinematography are just balancing factors. The plot is a rich one, that is as dynamic as it is present. He once again, after Blade Runner, 1492, and others helps us visit the depths of the human soul, which remains the same over all our historical and social experience. Even the fights, are displayed in such a way that all the blood is quite discrete, but still, making us feel like screaming and jumping out of our seats. I would also like to point out the performances of the cast, that is surprisingly good. We have some actors and actresses, who are not Hollywood icons, but are are greatly able to move the audience among screams and tears. All in all, we have guys like Russel Crowe, who are coming out to be part of a new and extremely promising harvest of people who are making each time more fans around the world. Well, you should see for yourself!"
"3625","Gladiator",10,"A nail biting, intense modern epic!","Most films require that the viewer identifies with the character to truly be engrossed with the film. If you can't feel something for the character, than the audience is lost.Luckily, in Ridley Scott's case, Russel Crowe is so captivating and convincing as a general loved by his troops and as a slave loved by the people that the movie really works. Possibly one of the greatest actors today, Crowe carries this epic film on his very capable shoulders.Not to say that he is the only reason this works. The supporting cast, most notably Connie Neilsen, buoy the film to new perspectives.Jacquin Phoenix definitely captures the egotisitcal persona he should display, stealing every scene he's in. Phoenix will surely be put on the map with Gladiator.But the real shining star in this film are the incredible action sequences which jolt the viewer right in with the opening sequences, as Maximus' true worth to the Roman Empire is displayed. Scott's camera work within these completed sequences takes a modern twist that really works for the gruesome scenes.Crowe will now get the respect he deserves for this collosal performance. Gladiator makes the most of its 2 and a half hours, marking a triumphant comeback for the long forgotten epics of the classic days of film. ALL HAIL MAXIMUS!"
"3626","Gladiator",10,"Edge of Your Seat Fun!","Great Story!  Great Writing!  Great Acting!  Great Directing!  Great Score! This movie has it all.  I especially enjoyed the mood of the film.  Even though it has a lot of action, there is a subtle elegance throughout the picture that gives it great style.  The movie flows effortlessly from scene to scene, while at the same time creating wonderful intensity and nail-biting excitement.The acting in the movie more than lives up to expectations.  Russell Crowe is brilliant in his role as Maximus, the ""general who became a slave, who became a gladiator, who defied an emperor.""  Crowe's intense style is perfect for the relentless determination and confidence of Maximus.  Joaquin Phoenix is equally wonderful in his role as Commodus, the corrupt emperor. He plays a great villain because he is able to give Commodus depth by showing certain vulnerable or fragile sides, while at the same time instantly transforming to let the ruthless nature of his volatile character shine.  It also helps that Joaquin has the classic Caesar look that works perfectly with his role.Connie Nielsen is also very good as Lucilla.  However, perhaps the two finest performances in the movie were given by a couple of acting veterans in supporting roles.  Richard Harris and Oliver Reed were exceptional in what will be remembered as crowning achievements at the end of their careers.  Harris was perfect as Marcus Aurelius, the aging Caesar who reflects upon his life and contemplates how the world will remember him. And Reed, especially, gave my personal favorite performance in the movie as Proximo, the trainer for the gladiators.  The way he spoke about the life of a gladiator, the splendor of Rome, and the ""thrill of the Coliseum"" really added excitement and anticipation during the viewing of the movie.Gladiator is filled with many memorable moments that one would need to see more than once to fully appreciate.  The excitement felt for me when Rome is first shown in all its wonder and marvel is my favorite scene.  But the whole movie is a rush!  Hans Zimmer provides the absolute perfect score to capture the different moods in the movie.  Ridley Scott sets the perfect tone with his artistic and creative directing.  I would recommend it to anyone who can stomach intensity and enjoy an epic story for the ages.  Next to Braveheart, this movie is the greatest of all-time!"
"3627","Gladiator",10,"Can't be missed!","""Gladiator"" definitely is a classic film as it combines a simple, but moving, story with beautiful scenery, filming, direction and score <U+0096> it is truly a ""complete"" movie.I am mostly compelled with the beautiful script which in a way reminds me of poetry, though it is still everyday language. I love the acting portrayed by the late Oliver Reed and also Richard Harris. Russell Crowe, Djimon Housou and Joaquin Phoenix are also superb and the parts suit them perfectly. There are also a number of less ""popular"" artists who also deserve a big ""bravo"". Amongst them I have to mention ex-Mr Universe Ralph Moeller who is mostly used as the comic relief of the movie. In Gladiator we can also the beautiful and popular Maltese TV Star and actress Ruth Frendo, who although has a small part, she is totally brilliant and outstanding.Actually I got to IMDb while I was looking for her name on the internet, in fact on IMDb she has some very stunning photos. I was lucky to meet Ruth Frendo whilst she was filming in another Maltese production. Ruth Frendo is not only a gorgeous and talented actress but she is also amazingly intelligent and very down-to-earth. We will definitely be seeing more of her work in the future... The scenery used for ""Gladiator"" is brilliant <U+0096> and the opening battle scene is definitely one of my top favorite scenes. The modern camera technique contrasts sharply to the brutality of the gladiators actions and blood shed during the movie; and I love the light contrasts thanks to the lenses which most definitely have been used to create a surreal feel to the entire movie.""Gladiator"" deserves all the awards and great reviews it has received, and for those of you who still haven't gone and watched it <U+0096> I can assure you that it will be well worth your time and money. So go on and rent it now!"
"3628","Gladiator",10,"Why don't they make films like this anymore","Seriously the best fantasy film of the modern area with great acting and emotional rollercoastering all the way through. The soundtrack by Zimmer really propels this film"
"3629","Gladiator",10,"Today I saw a movie become more powerful . . .","The movie is the story of Maximus (Crowe), a general who leads the Roman army to victory over Germania in the beginning of the movie. The dying emperor of Rome, Marcus Aurelius, is watching this battle.The emperor's son, Commodus, then arrives with his sister Lucilla, and it is discovered that Commodus fully expects to be announced the new emperor of Rome in a few days. Aurelius, however, has other plans--he wants to make Maximus emperor, and requests that of the general, who wants nothing more than to go home to his family.I went into this movie having just watched Ben-Hur in my film studies class and having watched an episode of Xena only a couple of weeks earlier that featured the story of Marc Anthony and Cleopatra. So you could say I was in the perfect mindset to watch a ""sword-and-sandal"" movie. I wasn't sure what to expect, having somehow avoided all the hype that accompanied this movie. But I was not disappointed.Gladiator features some wonderful cinematography by John Mathieson. The battle scenes are very graphic. (This movie is not for the squeamish, that's for sure.) There were some scenes in particular that really struck me, such as when Crowe appears to be floating over the ground very fast.  The use of color and color tones added a great deal to the mood of the movie. Excellent.The script was being written and re-written as the filming was going on, yet it doesn't show that the actors had no idea how the movie was going to end when they began filming.  The acting is terrific. Russell Crowe is wonderfully cast as Maximus. Many reviewers agree that he is now officially a star. Joaquin Phoenix also proves his mettle as the emotionally troubled Commodus, whose behavior and emotion toward his sister could give anyone the creeps. Connie Nielsen makes you believe that, as Lucilla, she really is torn between natural loyalty to her brother and doing what she knows is right. Oliver Reed, in his last performance, is memorable in his role of Proximo, the former gladiator who is the owner of Maximus and brings him to Rome.  In short, the actors were brilliant in their roles, not over-acting, but giving subtle, strong performances.The script itself is very good.  Although some elements are a little hard to believe--the fact that no one recognizes Maximus when he's a slave?--this film calls for a willing suspension of disbelief, which one would happily comply with.  (It's really no fun to nitpick such a movie.)It's true that this movie does pretty much follow the Braveheart formula. However, this movie includes some elements, such as the cinematography and the incredibly graphic battle scenes (one reviewer likened it to Saving Private Ryan, ""only better""), that are spectacular in itself. Overall, a great movie that I highly recommend."
"3630","Gladiator",NA,"Cecil B DeMille eat your heart out","The epic blockbuster returns with the 21st Century's answer to Cecil B DeMille, Ridley Scott and his dramatic tale of courage and revenge, GLADIATOR - ""the general who became a slave, the slave who became a gladiator, the gladiator who defied an emperor"".Once a great roman General, and as good as adopted son of Marcus Aurelius Caesar (Harris), Maximus (Crowe) is forced into exile by Commodus (Phoenix), heir to the throne, after the death of Marcus. Saved from death by slavers, he is purchased for use as a gladiator by Proximo (Reed) and ends up in the arena of all arena's, the Colloseum, where he proves unbeatable under his guise as ""The Spaniard"".And with a budget of over $100m, Scott certainly delivers the goods. GLADIATOR transcends the notion of 'blockbuster' that we have become accustomed to in the age of electronic and special effects wizardry and instead offers a good old fashioned action film along the lines of Spartacus and and Ben Hur. Not only are we drawn into an archetypal story that contains all the classic elements a filmgoer could dream of (love, loss, courage, despair, good triumphing over evil etc etc) - also on offer is a visual feast of cinematic painting after painting - a rich tapestry of images that are breathtaking and ultimately visually satisfying. From the plains of Germania, to the desert stronghold of Zuchobar, and finally to great Rome herself, John Mathiesion, the cinematographer is to be commended highly for his general inventiveness and ability to capture so much on film. The opening  battle scene is superb as a cast of thousands erupt across the screen and provide an indication that we are about to see a film that pays incredible attention to detail throughout its entirety. In every way, Scott has created a world for us that scuttles films of similar epic undertakings (and budgets!) and sends them to their dooms at the bottom of the murky depths of film history where they belong.The cast is generally very strong. Crowe proves himself very suitable to the task with a great emotional range and depth of character. His accent ocassionally bugged me (as did the mish mash of accents on offer - but that is I guess a legacy of 'internationally casted films'), but this aside, he was well and truly up to the task. Phoenix is also excellent as the disturbed Commodus, as is Nielson as Lucilla, the daughter of Marcus who ""should have been a son"" and finds herself torn between loyalty to her brother and doing what is 'right'. The old guard thesps of Harris, Reed and Jacobi (Grachus) are uniformly strong as supporting characters, and Spencer Treat Clark (Lucius) does a fine job as the young heir to the throne.Add to this great cast excellent editing and post production work, and an intricate soundscape (including a magnificent Hans Zimmer score), and you have a film that, despite its length, was highly palatable and had me in there from beginning to end. A must see."
"3631","Gladiator",NA,"One of the Greatest Movies Ever","I love history, and to me, Gladiator is a masterpiece. It is the most accurate picture of the Roman Empire Hollywood has ever put out.  People declare Spartacus a masterpiece, but Gladiator far outdoes Spartacus in quality.  The costuming, the acting, the screenplay, the scenery, and the fighting styles made me think that I had traveled back to 180 A.D. Russell Crowe is a true Hollywood tough guy, and he is superb in this movie. Joaquin Phoenix is outstanding as a villain, one of the best in movie history.  He played his character as if it were a psychologist's dream case. Connie Nielsen plays one of the strongest female characters that I have ever seen.  The choreographer of the action sequences was brilliant. Ridley Scott did an outstanding job in recreating the Empire, including the multitude of ethnic groups within the Empire and accurately depicting everyday life.  If you're looking for insight into what the Roman Empire was like, this is a perfect depiction."
"3632","Gladiator",NA,"Special effects and powerful acting make Gladiator an epic.","I borrowed this movie on DVD, but I wish I had seen it in the theater for it would have been a lot more fun and powerful there. Despite this, Gladiator is one of the most powerful and moving films I've ever seen. The plot goes so smooth together, as well as the acting and the terrific musical score. Director Ridley Scott puts all effort into making this film an epic, and he does just that. I'd have to say that anyone who likes Ridley Scott (I sure do) should see this. It is a lot like Ridley's other movies (Black Hawk Down was also amazing). If you can stand a little bit--well, ok a LOT of blood and gore, then you should see this. Russell Crowe shows an excellent performance like no other. I don't think there's one bad movie that Ridley Scott has made or that Russell Crowe has acted in. The fact that the brutal battles involving innocent slaves in this film actually happened in real life centuries ago makes it even more interesting and powerful. Emperor Commodus is a truely evil and life-like villian who shows a lot of his wits in attempts to get his revenge against Maximus.Ridley Scott went to many different locations to shoot this film to make it real, and he does. The film is set in Rome, and it looks just like it. You feel as if you are there in the crowd, hearing them cheer and cheer to see the death. To some of you, this may sound a little barbaric, and believe me the film is VERY barbaric and brutual, however it teaches a very strong lesson of what happens when an economy turns as violent as Rome was. Ridley Scott goes to many lengths to make this movie real, because even though the characters are fictitious, all of this really did happen. Innocent people had to go through brutual fighting while thousands of people cheered for either their death or the enemy's death. If you were an inexperienced fighter, chances are you would get killed. But the strange thing is that Rome LOVED this. People came from all over to see these fights and to see the blood that was shed, that is why you can't blame the characters in this film for being so forlorn and saddened the whole time. The film itself is very dark. The theme is dark and the ending is dark. From beginning to end there is excessive violence (for those action movie-goers, this is a movie for you). But if the violence is concerning you, don't let it. The special effects make the movie great, but it's the acting and storyline that make it spectacular. HIGHLY RECCOMMENDED for anyone who wants a good time. Definitely makes you think. ***** out of *****."
"3633","Gladiator",8,"A Throwback To The Epics Of The '60s","An intense Roman epic, a la ""Ben-Hur"" or ""Spartacus,"" it was nice to see something like this made again. It had been since the 1960s that we had seen a 3-hour extravaganza like this.Like Ben-Hur, this is a story of a successful man who loses everything thanks to an evil man, and then has to fight his way back up to seek revenge on that man and to obtain his freedom back. It's a tried-and-true formula. This movie doesn't go to excess on the violence as some of the other more recent epic films did, such as ""Braveheart"" or ""The Patriot.""The acting is excellent, beginning with Russell Crowe, who has established himself as one of the best actors of today. Joaquin Phoenix also put himself ""on the map"" as an actor with his portrayal of the evil ""Commodus."" He's so annoying you want to slap that sucker, which means he's doing a good job acting. Kudos to the rest of the cast, too.Too bad they don't make more of these type of films, as they did in the 1950s and 1960s."
"3634","Gladiator",NA,"Is Crowe the 'next action hero?'","Germania, 150 AD, the setting of Gladiator's opening scene. Far from the blazing sun and dazzlingly beauty of ancient Rome, Ridley Scott shoots the opening sequence in a subdued light. The Roman legions are nonetheless impeccably turned out as they face the comparatively disorganised rabble that inhabits this miserable environment. Caesar's soldiers seem somewhat misplaced here. However, Russell Crowe is at home in this environment of knee-deep mud and merciless snow. He commands the screen with all the virtues of his motto: <U+0091>Strength and Honour.'The plot, with its hero-to-zero-to-hero nature, runs through Gladiator's every vein. As General Maximus, Russell Crowe is welcomed by Marcus Aurelius Caesar (Richard Harris) to take the Roman throne as Emperor of a new Republic. All does not run smoothly however as mislead heir to the throne Commodus (Phoenix) takes over Rome with ill-gotten domination, having dispatched his own Father. Maximus is cast out to find his family murdered and his Spanish farm burnt to the ground. Taken in as a slave by Proximo (Reed), Maximus becomes a Gladiator and starts his journey to the Coliseum and revenge against Commodus.Scott's cast is powerful and he is not left wanting as powerful performances are delivered by all. Due to his untimely mid-production death, Oliver Reed is created in some scenes by the grace of computer graphics, which are as convincing as they come; sometimes making it difficult to differentiate between Reed himself and his computerised counterpart.
It is, however, the supporting actors who create many of Gladiator's best dialogue-based scenes. In an accomplished demonstration of her acting ability as Lucilla, Connie Nielsen saves the occasional scene as Joaquim Phoenix shows us that he can <U+0091>do evil', but is less convincing when it comes to the more emotional qualities of his role.As a vehicle for the plot, Scott's beautifully created and highly symbolic (there is an image of fire in nearly every shot of the film) dialogue scenes are of a certain merit with digitally created backgrounds that encompass the meticulous nature of the Roman Empire. However, dialogue alone does not an epic movie make, and it is in the film's spectacular action sequences that Gladiator come into its own. Shot on location in Malta, Scott's first arena was built by an army of locals and commanded some 5000 extras (a large majority of whom were of a cardboard variety). All of this pales in comparison as we arrive in a digitally created Rome which makes some scenes in Ben Hur some somewhat small scale. The Coliseum is immense, both inside and out, and the computerised provides the electric atmosphere in which Crowe and his feline companions (four sizeable, and real, Bengal tigers) perform.The battle sequences are perfectly choreographed and shot as iconic masks and typically Roman chariots are abundant in their power and imagery. As swords clash and heads roll, Ridley Scott is triumphant in the application of special effects technology and his directorial prowess.Always one to embrace technology, Scott's views over Rome's landscape are reminiscent of the beautifully created cityscape of Blade Runner. This is a film that fears so little and boasts so much, even a lady archer being sliced clean in half by a spiked chariot wheel!All those involved with Gladiator should be delighted and confident with their creation, for indeed this is a convincing and enthralling display with epic proportions to take the wind from James Cameron's titanic sails."
"3635","Gladiator",9,"Nitpicking is only criticism","There is so little to find wanting in this film and not wanting to merely repeat its many deserved praises, all I can do is question a couple of historical points.It is unlikely that a Roman general would be sold into slavery and forced to fight in the arena. Exiled, yes. Killed maybe. Asked to commit suicide to retain his property, most likely. It is unlikely that he would return to find his family crucified, of all things. Romans were very specific about who got crucified and why. Romans usually avoided it, no matter how cruel the tyrant(?) was.Roman legionnaires would NEVER have a tattoo unless they were barbarians who got one BEFORE joining a legion. Marking or mutilating the human body was expressedly anti- Roman. No statue or depiction exists of a main-period Roman showing a body-marking. The bonding feature the writer was attempting was an inappropriate borrowing from the 20th century German SS.Great entertaining movie nonetheless."
"3636","Gladiator",NA,"Great Story but Far From Historical","Firstly, Romans never referred to the Colloseum as the ""Colloseum"".  It was called the Flavian Amphitheatre.Commodus was an actual emperor who ruled from A.D. 180 to 192.  He did indeed fight in the Colloseum against gladiators, and was quite good at it because he never lost (Maybe he cheated like in the movie).His sister, Lucilla, did conspire with his wife Crispina to have him killed. They were caught and banished to an island and later killed.His mistress Marcia tried to drug him to death but failed, so they had some athlete strangle him to death.  He died on New Year's Eve A.D. 192.He was a nut case, and was quite murderous, but that's about the only things real about the movie.Other than the historical problems, the story was great.  I liked Maximus and really hated Commodus.  It was your basic struggle between good and evil."
"3637","Gladiator",7,"Adequate Roman Epic","There is much to appreciate about about this picture but at the same time there is much to castigate as well. What could have been a thoroughly involving story turns out to be crippled by a lean script, some very indecisive direction and choppy editing. Not to mention some bad casting in the form of Richard Harris as Marcus Aurelius, a role which cries out to have been the last role played by Anthony Quinn.The film starts out well and looks bleakly authentic in its depiction of the pivotal battle in the wars between the barbarian tribes of Germania and the Roman Empire. But as the story gives way to 40 minutes of exposition following Commodus and Lucilla's introduction, Ridley Scott seems to tack things on whenever the script runs into weak spots. This leaves the film without a flowing narrative and it seems to want to please a mindless summer movie action market while at the same time aspiring to be something deeper. What it leaves us with is a schizophrenic, unequivocal story full of contradictions. There seems to be an epidemic in the past three or four years - films like this, Titanic, The Patriot, Pearl Harbor, Enemy at the Gates etc, try hard to be great epic films but at their core they are very slight and even trivial. The story in Gladiator holds promise but what little conflict there is set up and thrown at us in the first hour, leaving just a linear resolution to unfold for the remainder. A shame because so many elements could have been introduced in this story to make it truly an awesome and thoughtful epic. I guess complex stories like Spartacus and Ben-Hur will never be made again. This one falls somewhere short, though better than Demitrius and the Gladiators and the film it heavily borrows its narrative structure from - The fall of the Roman Empire.Technically the CGI is at times seamless and other times poor. When our troop of Gladiators run into the colosseum for the first time however the effect is absolutely jaw dropping and the scene that follows certainly delivers the action goods. The acting is very good throughout except for Tomas Arana as Quintus (about as bad as John Dall in Spartacus) and the aforementioned Richard Harris. Like Braveheart, not a bad entertainment experience but highly Hollywoodized and with an uneven narrative. But unlike Braveheart, the ending to Gladiator is a just a little embarrassing as it rips off both Braveheart and Titanic to far less effect. If you can get past the flaws, not the worst Roman spectacle on offer. Too highly rated at 8.1/10."
"3638","Gladiator",10,"You have to watch this movie at least 3 times in your life","You have to watch this movie at least 3 times in your life: First time - in puberty for the special effects and epic battles. Like the little Lucius, this movie will likely make you to dream of being a gladiator.Second time - in your 30's for the love, life choices and loses. This is the time when you fight all your battles for yourself and your family. Like Maximus you will dream to get out of your Colosseum and break the chains.Third time - when you feel your life is close to an end - just to remember what you have achieved. Like the old emperor Marcus Aurelius you will have to realize if your name would be remembered or forgotten forever. Is your family close to you in your final hours or you are going to see them in the afterlife. Have you been a good parent?I really enjoy this movie every time I watch it."
"3639","Gladiator",NA,"Violent with a purpose","I saw the movie on video because I was nervous of the gore others had mentioned, but the movie was like a poem. You could not have left out one drop of blood, one terrifying character, one disturbing dream, nor could you have added anything at all. Deeply violent, yet not one gratuitous drop of blood was shed, not one encounter without reason. A classically made film, and a beaut. Don't miss it, whether or not you've seen something that disappointed you, or had a bad day at the arena. Think ""Spartacus"" and you've got it."
"3640","Gladiator",7,"A class act!!","I am usually worried that I'm in for a big let-down when I am looking forward to a film as much as I was to this one.  This time however, I was very pleasantly suprised, when Gladiator not only fulfilled but surpassed my expectations.  It's a brilliant film, which (while containing weaknesses such as a script which wasn't quite as good as it could have been, and one climactic scene which completely changes, and ruins, the ending) manages to engage your heart and mind.The performances are without exception excellent (although the accents may distract a bit, there is such a wide variety of them).  I must single out for commendation Mr. Phoenix, who despite his youth manages to portray a character with such conviction that you never for a moment doubt his interpretation.  His physical performance is as good as his mental one.The film rests firmly on the (extremely attractive and capable) shoulders of one Russell Crowe.  In a tour-de-force performance, he manages to convey a man (not a superhuman) with frailties and doubts and fears and heart.  I cannot convey to you how brilliant this man's performance was.  If anyone else had been this character, the film would have rated at best a five out of ten.Kudos to Russell Crowe, and to Ridley Scott, for managing to keep this film on a level with humanity, rather than one in which the characters become killing machines.A must see, five stars out of five."
"3641","Gladiator",7,"Victory of production over a lousy script","There is an unwritten rule in movie making that if you have an excellent script it doesn't matter how you film it. If you have a lousy script - then everything else matters, the direction, the cinematography, the acting, the music... ""Gladiator"" is an epitome of the latter half of that rule. The case where direction, music, acting and art direction completely redeemed a crappy story.For me it took watching it in German overdubbing. As I don't speak German there was nothing to detract me from visuals and music. And it's a new experience on another level. But more on that later. First the crappy part. The story.Make no mistake, whether you care about history or not, this is a horrible script. It's taking huge (and quite unacceptable) liberties with the period it purports to portray, it's unconvincing even on its own terms, the dialog is pretty much high school and in its core it's a predictable revenge story told a zillion times before. Apparently (according to a documentary about Hollywood screenwriters) only Russell Crowe didn't know what turd the script was so he contributed himself with the juvenile ""husband of the dead wife"" speech.Ridley Scott and his crew apparently knew what stinker they had to work with and did their best to defeat it with excellence in all areas and actually made two films in one.On the surface it's a revenge story. The hero, a favorite army general turned gladiator, seeks revenge against a young emperor, who had general's family killed during the tumultuous succession to the throne. The military battles and the gladiatorial bouts required for this aspect of the movie are done both to tremendous detail and on a grand scale. With the help of CGI they are seen in all their glory and gore. Some accuse Scott of shying away from action but his direction shows everything one needs to see. Yes, the cuts are brief, the camera sometimes doesn't follow through, but the editing is pure poetry and you miss nothing. Cinematography-wise every frame is shot in a way that you could just hang it on a wall as a nice picture. Costumes and scenery are impeccable. A revenge story, yes, but well worth watching.But on another level ""Gladiator"" plays out like a remake of ""Fall of a Roman Empire"". But it's not in the script. It's in the mood set again by production. This other story is about the decline and death of classical Rome and its ideals. There is simple yet effective symbolism to express it, the play on dark and light and the sunrise-sunset arc. The movie starts with a battle at dawn, the way the Rome itself had once dawned, fighting. There is an ideal Roman hero, valiant and dutiful, there's a typical Roman villain, clandestine and scheming. Hero does his best in the light, the villain does his worst in the dark, whenever they swap environments during the movie they fail miserably. The story ends at sunset, symbolizing the end of the Empire itself, and although an uplifting speech is given at that point it is defeated by the setting sun.The feeling of the doom is constantly emphasized by melancholic music. The dreamlike experience of the main character who is already dead but doesn't yet know it is enhanced when he finally visits Rome and the city is an idealistic, blown in proportions version of itself. The script may be a complete falsification of history, but the feeling of decline one gets when watching those scenes is probably completely faithful.So forget the story and the closing speech. Watch and listen the movie. The Roman Empire is living and dying once more before your very eyes."
"3642","Gladiator",7,"Nice movie but is this original","Movie is technically very fine i have watched in theater twice and i like it much as lots of turks but sometime after the reason why we loved this movie became clear this was only a western look over an old Turkish movie series Tarkan... Maximus was so Turkic that he was wearing lamb fur(lamb was introduced by Huns to Europe) instead of bright armors of Romans,Like Tarkan he rides along his wolf, his family has been murdered by his foes ... you can claim that these may be inspirations of Ridley Scott from Tarkan but there are some scenes taken directly from Tarkan movies...1- Maximus fights a big German guy - Tarkan's fight against Giant Orso both are under snow.. 2- After the fight in arena, emperor orders death- neither Tarkan nor Maximus kill the victims. 3-The scene of birds over Rome 4-The appear order and camera movements in the arena at least the final is different, Maximus dies though Tarkan is immortal"
"3643","Gladiator",10,"Best Christmas present this year.","My daughter bought me the video for Christmas, and we watched it on Christmas Day.We all flinched, gasped, sighed and cried right to the very end. I fell in love, and my daughter, who is nine and a half and has almost 300 videos, said it was the best film she had ever seen.I am one of those people who watches movies to be entertained, and this did it for me.10/10"
"3644","Gladiator",9,"Gladiator is better than...","Gladiator is the best epic war film. Gladiator has the best war scenes I've ever scene. Better than Troy and much better than Alexander. I liked the digital effects in Gladiator. Troy and Alexander are pretty fun to watch, but in Alexander, i really want to forward it to exciting scenes, like war sequences. Gladiator, I can just sit there and watch it, because if you miss a part, you won't get it. The end was great, i really liked it. It was the best fight scene at the end. Every part kept me interested and there wasn't one part that bored me. It had one of the best endings ever. So if your tired of crappy, imitating war movies go to this one it's the best there is.10/10"

The film results to be a special remake to ¨Fall of Roman Empire¨ directed by Antony Mann with Stephen Boyd , Sofia Loren and Christopher Plummer as Commodus , though is a little revisionist about characters , history and time when is developed the action . Before directing ¨Robin Hood , Kingdom of heaven¨ films , director Ridley Scott and Russell Crowe teamed but with much bigger budget . The final product looked as although the actors learn the screenplay and decided the best issue was to take a good time and amuse themselves and both managed to stage some excellent action scenes . Great performances abound , as stalwart Russell Crowe playing an enslaved ex-general who bent on vengeance , he is very fine ; in addition , vacilating empress Connie Nielsen is memorable and attractive , she comes up the film as a valiant and obstinate woman . Special mention to gladiator owner magnetically performed by Oliver Reed and Joaquin Phoenix as evil and crazed emperor in a sensationalistic interpretation . Marvelous relationship between Maximus-Russel Crowe and an African slave-Dijimon Honsou , the deep bond lends a P.C. historicity. Ample support cast formed by notorious British secondaries as David Hemmings David Schofield , John Schrapnel and endearing Derek Jacobi . There are great action sequences including the battle against Barbarians and the final confrontation in arena at the climax of the film. Impeccable but sometimes dark cinematography by John Mathieson . Movie is shot on natural sets and interior scenarios with impressive production design by Arthur Max , but also excessive use of computer generator images . Magnificent and sensible musical score by Hans Zimmer and Lisa Gerrard , including wonderful songs .I found it fun , well-acted , in Peplum tradition and fast-paced.The motion picture packed with pomp and pageantry is lavishly produced by the prestigious Douglas Wick and David Franzoni , also screenwriter ; being glamorously directed by Ridley Scott , at his best and as stylish as ever , similarly his previous film ¨Someone to watch over me¨ and others as ¨Blade runner¨, ¨Black rain¨ , ¨Legend¨ in which his visual style is impressive . The picture belongs to his speciality ,the historical genre , as ¨Robin Hood¨ , ¨Kingdom of heaven¨ , ¨Duelists¨ and ¨Black Hawk down¨ . Rating : Above average . Essential and indispensable watching for Ridley Scott followers"
"3646","Gladiator",10,"The movie that puts back History on your radar","Can you still make a great period movie, which is commercially viable too in these days? Apparently you can, as Ridley Scott and Russell Crowe prove with this magnum opus.What strikes you most about ""Gladiator"" are not the dazzling sets and costumes - though they contribute to the effect too. Where ""Gladiator"" delivers is in the area of raw human emotions we are so familiar with.As somebody said, switching to the other mind-set is half the fun, and Gladiator takes you right to the midst of Romans' politics, their passions, their dreams and their weaknesses.After Ben-Hur, I feel this is the best period movie to have ever emerged from Hollywood.-Murali Chari"

The continuity is confusing and has nothing to do with the first movie, to the point that I'm literally lost how the first one could have happened in this Troll universe.

I am glad that we at least didn't pay the full $20 that was originally charged.I thought the first five minutes was going to be good, then it all fell apart. The underwater scene really pissed me off.The characters are lacking in continuity. The plot is stupid. The script has terrible dialog. It sucked completely.

"3672","Clueless",8,"Easy to like","Director Amy Heckerling knows a thing or two about high school flicks, having directed the highly successful `Fast Times at Ridgemont High'. Heckerling put her talents to work thirteen years later for the next generation of high schoolers, writing and directing this hilarious satire of life at Beverly Hills H.S.  Heckerling takes a different approach from `Fast Times', which found its comedy in the absurdity of reality, depicting situations into which teenagers really get themselves.  Here Heckerling's comedy mostly comes from mocking the superficiality of the high school `in-crowd'.  While this is not the first time this has been done, few have ever done it with such blistering wit.  This film became the standard for a spate of 1990's high school flicks set on the west coast that borrowed many of its elements.The story focuses on Cher Horowitz (Alicia Silverstone), who is the most popular girl at Beverly Hills H.S.  Cher seems to be a superficial airhead, but this belies her conniving and manipulative skills at getting what she wants.   Superficial yes, airhead no!  In a plot derived in part from Jane Austen's `Emma', Cher works behind the scenes to arrange love matches between various students.  She even orchestrates a relationship between two teachers to improve their moods so they don't grade so harshly.  Like Emma, she is a master of love for everyone but herself.Heckerling does a fantastic job of presenting what seems on the surface to be a cotton candy story with lightweight characters, but really runs much deeper revealing subtle truths about human nature.  Her direction of the fledgling cast is superb, milking every ounce of comedy out of each scene.Silverstone sparkles in the role, which is probably not far from a reality with which she is very familiar.  She actually attended Beverly Hills H.S. with co-star Breckin Meyer, although she didn't graduate due to career commitments (she received a G.E.D.).  This film catapulted her to teen prominence with two MTV movie awards and an American Comedy Award as funniest actress in a leading role.  She plays Cher with both arrogance and vulnerability, and her comic timing is impeccable.  She also has a knack for physical comedy, with a broad range of contorted facial expressions and amusing use of body language.  The rest of the teen cast is also great, especially Brittany Murphy as Tai and Breckin Meyer as Travis.  Dan Hedaya is also priceless as Cher's work obsessed attorney father.This film is easy to like.  It is a light and funny spoof, but it still has nuance.  I rated it an 8/10.  For those who enjoy high school comedies, this is required viewing."
"3673","Clueless",9,"Clueless: An near-perfectly updated classic","""Isn't my house classic? The columns date all the way back to 1972.""When romantic high-school comedy Clueless (1995) was released, it was immediately vaulted into cult-status and firmly stapled as one of the most original teen-flicks of the 1990s. 'Original' is perhaps a term wrongly applied since it is based on the queen of romance Jane Austen's Emma (1815) . But what Clueless did was update the classic story by coating it with high school drama, teenage girls and shopping and sprinkle it with heavy doses of humour.Emma is no longer Emma; she is Cher (Alicia Silverstone), a spoiled rich girl walking around in her Beverly Hills mansion in a bubble of stereotypes and teen-clichés -- but with a great big heart. So big-hearted, in fact, that she takes on the lost goofy new girl in her school to find her love and popularity, knowing full-well that it could destroy her own reputation. Clueless thus sees Cher and her best friend Dionne (Stacey Dash) on a mission to do good. Real good.All the detours this mission entail are captured brilliantly in the film, taking the form of love-interests, parties, shopping and misunderstandings. From Cher's grumpy lawyer-father (an hilarious Dan Hedaya) and her nerdy step-brother (a likable Paul Rudd) to her eccentric group of friends at school, Clueless is a superb ride of teenage comedy camp. Only just over 10 years old, it is still extremely dated today. But no matter, because the 90s clichés like skateboarding, Marky Mark and the catch-phrase ""As if"" just make it so much more contemporary and fun to watch. What elevates Clueless (1995) above generic high school comedy is its use of stereotypes. In most films they are unintentionally there to create a subconscious effect, but in Clueless they are made fun of to a much higher degree -- they are overblown and glorious. It brutally satirizes rich kids and their 'problems' and juxtaposes them with a classic, heart-felt love-story. The kind that only Jane Austen can write.9/10"
"3674","Clueless",6,"Cher is the best girl who deserve love!!!","I love how the movie represent the new perspective about blonde girls, it show that you can be both popular and kind. it a bit boring but the mood of this movie is so good."

"3677","Clueless",8,"So Coquettish even her brother falls for her","Not like all the other teen movies.
Honestly, I love this movie. Alicia was very attractive and the only misgiving it had was that the class-mate did not try to bang her, which is not realistic. The whole plot was full of cool, fashionable and well put together hotties, and being that backed up by comedy, at least for me anyways. I like Brit Murphy and that adds to the reasons I enjoyed the whole movie.
Alicia's body though: perfection!"
"3678","Clueless",NA,"Funny And Cute","Cher is a high school virgin who nonetheless professes to all matters of love, relationship, fashion and even wades into her father's law practice. She was named after a former singer who now does infomercials.That is where the story begins and it is a feast for the senses. There are genione funny moments, clever lines with all sorts of cultural references and the girls act all preppy an fashionable, and they are, but are not as well organized and in control as they appear.I really like the fact that they know their fashion and styles and are well put together and I really like how they make fun of slobs and people who have no sense of trying to make an effort.Watch this one."
"3679","Clueless",8,"Joyous and sparkling teen comedy","This movie is way above so many of the others of its' kind. It's consumately likable, funny, sweet and sharp- the script is a killer, and the acting is fun and enjoyable.Part of the success of the film is due to the fact that it appeals to several different audiences, and on multiple levels. I first watched this movie with my mom, who loved the link it has to Jane Austen's Emma- all the main characters and the plot are direct modern equivalents to the novel. For instance, the famous passage in Emma inwhich Harriet burns all her ""mementos"" of Mr. Elton becomes the scene where Tai does so infront of Cher's gasfire. From this perspective alone, the movie is so fun and sharp to watch- even if your forte isn't usually American Teen High School comedy!But this movie works on a really dumbed down scale too- let's face it, not everyone is big on English literature. The movie has an awesome soundtrack, Paul Rudd is unbelievably cute as ""Mr Knightly"" or rather Josh- and my boyfriend leads me to believe that the same is true of Alicia Silverstone- who still sparkles 10 years later as a mid-nineties teen queen with good intentions, Cher. Her performance here is impossible not to warm too, unless you have some sort of grudge against Valley girls, inwhich case you might not like it so much. Seriously though, this film is a must see for anyone who likes some real quality comedy- I'm so fond of this film personally that I would suspect basically everyone would enjoy it."
"3680","Clueless",NA,"Funny, charming and innocent","This movie is another one of those feel good pictures you can't go wrong with. It's light and breezy like cruising the boulevard with the top down and it offers lots of laughs to boot.Amy Heckerling has brought us another winner with a great supporting cast. A young teenage girl coming of age in of all places, Beverly Hills. The lead character, ""Cher"" played brilliantly by Alicia Silverstone, is a self centered high school girl in the beginning of the picture who's only interests include clothes, cars and credit cards. As the film progresses, she begins to mature and actually begins to care about other people, not to mention her environment. It's worth renting anytime. Just like ""European Vacation"" it doesn't matter how many times you see it, it still makes you laugh and that's worth it all."
"3681","Clueless",10,"greatest chick flick ever!","Iconic teen movie <3 brittany murphy is amazing in that movie, and alicia silverstone is gorgeous!"
"3682","Clueless",8,"Cluey in spite of its cluelessness","""Let's set 'Emma' in a modern high school!""  Does this sound the obvious kind of movie gimmick that everyone uses nowadays?  Perhaps, but it's an inspired idea all the same.  Jane Austen's characters, and her readers, and the society in which her novels are set, like Jane Austen herself, are HEAVILY conscious of class and social standing.  No atmosphere quite so snobbish exists in the modern world.  EXCEPT, that is, in the corridors and courtyards of the right kind of high school.  And where else in the modern world would you find so many people who seem to spend all their time calling on one another?I was reminded of how well Heckerling moulded ""Emma"" to fit a modern setting when I saw the idiotic 1998 version of ""Great Expectations"", adapted by someone who somehow failed to notice how important all the stuff about class and snobbishness was.  It's clear that Heckerling understood her source. She isn't afraid to make changes - even radical changes, if the modern setting requires as much - and no character exists MERELY because they have an analogue in Austen's novel.  (The most crucial thing is that the Emma-equivalent be sufficiently charming; and so she is.)  The result is a film which is winning and satisfying, whether or not you know anything about the source material."
"3683","Clueless",NA,"An Excellent Modern Teen Adaptation Of Austen's 'Emma'","Just the other day I watched Heckerling's wonderful romantic comedy satire 'I Could Never Be Your Woman' and I thought I'd revisit 'Clueless'. The last time I saw it was 10 years ago and today I enjoyed it just as much. Heckerling's adaptation of Jane Austen's 'Emma' may appear like a fluffy teen flick on the surface but there is a lot more to it. It works on multiple levels and 'Clueless', in a way, is a social commentary as it reflects a reality that still exists in today's society. First of all, the teen life is very realistically portrayed albeit with a sarcastic tone (such as the striving for high grades, obsession with image and partying). It somewhat reminds me of 'Heathers' (another excellent teen satire). While 'Heathers' is a much darker film that looks at teens in the 1980s, 'Clueless' looks at the adolescents of the 90s. Moreover, Heckerling brilliantly uses different kid of comedies through one-liner and dialogue, situational, and slap stick.Then the class distinction too is cleverly demonstrated through the eyes of Cher. The characters too work on multiple levels. Cher appears to be a popular stuckup bimbo type lass but once Hecklerling allows us to dig a little deeper, we see that she is unintentionally manipulative and knows how to use her strength (her power of persuasion). Yet, she is good at heart and even though her initial intentions of getting the two teacher together was to get an A grade, she's happy with the outcome of her matchmaking and the acts that follow are with more sincere purpose. Tai too appears to be the dumb new girl but she is far more experienced than Cher and when opportunity strikes she makes a place for herself in 'society' (i.e, highschool).Alicia Silverstone plays the part as though it was made for her. She has the right looks, age, excellent dialogue delivery and is a total natural in performing. 'Clueless' was the film that made her an overnight star and a very promising actress however, unfortunately, her following movies have been disastrous and the actress rapidly vanished into oblivion. She is supported by an equally great cast that includes a goofy Breckin Meyer, a weirdly fashioned but still gorgeous Stacy Dash, a naive Brittany Murphy, a laidback Paul Rudd, a hilarious Donald Faison, a bitchy Elisa Donovan and a fire breathing Dan Hedaya.For me 'Clueless' is among the top teen films along with movies like 'Heathers'. Those who childishly dismiss it as a fluffy chick-flick don't know what they missed. I was watching '10 Things I Hate About You' which is an adaptation of Shakespeare's 'The Taming Of Thew Shrew' and while that film failed to engage me for the most parts, 'Clueless' succeeds in all departments because it's much more than just another teen flick. It's a highly entertaining satire and it's a nuanced teen comedy with a subtle social comment."
"3684","Clueless",6,"A refreshing change from the John Hughes/""Breakfast Club"" generation","Silky-smooth, vanilla-coated pleasure about matchmaking in modern-day high school. Far from the insufferable smugness of all those '80s teen-flicks, ""Clueless"" is bright--in both senses of the word--clever, funny, fanciful and yet grounded in reality (a rich one). Alicia Silverstone is adorable, but the supporting cast is affable and seemingly carefully-picked (they all get their share of funny lines, particularly Dan Hedaya superb as Silverstone's father). Seems more inspired by Jane Austen's ""Emma"" than based upon it, with a few mean-spirited lines but plenty of lightly innocent laugh-getters. **1/2 from ****"
"3685","Clueless",NA,"My brief review of the film","A generally quite well made, enjoyably stylish and interesting matchmaking tale aimed at teen audiences, the film manages to incorporate a number of very clever parallels to Jane Austen's matchmaking novel 'Emma' while also providing a good satire on high school life. The idea is somewhat simplistic, the plot is sort of predictable, and the young performers all look too old for their teenage characters, but these are all minor vices against this strong entry for the teen flicks genre, with a surprisingly very realistic and actually almost heartfelt performance by Alica Silverstone to top it all off."
"3686","Clueless",7,"A pleasant surprise","I wasn't expecting much of this movie, until I started seeing it. It turned out to be quite entertaining. ""Clueless"" is about the shallow and rather stupid rich girl Cher Horowitz, who only cares about herself and how popular she is. But then she starts this kind of 'project', together with her best friend. One of the aspects of this project is about making a new silly girl of their school look as 'cool' as they are. This 'silly' girl is very well performed by Brittany Murphy. I hardly recognized her! The lead role is for Alicia Silverstone who gives an excellent performance as well. Furthermore there is another great performance Paul Rudd (who we also know as Phoebe's boyfriend in ""Friends""). Also Dan Hedaya and Breckin Meyer (Road Trip) are funny.Funny and very entertaining movie from the director of ""Look Who's Talking (Too). Definitely worth watching! 7,5/10"
"3687","Clueless",7,"Clever spin on Austen's story with good satire and performances","Cher (Alicia Silverstone) is a popular ditz at her local high school in Beverly Hills. She's a spoiled, pampered little princess with all the right social connections and endless wealth. However she has yet to find a man in her life - all the Baldwins (as she and her clique of friends call guys they like) have been taken.When Cher receives a foreign exchange student, she takes her under her wing and decides to try and find her a boyfriend - ironically without having her own yet. Predictability ensues.I read ""Emma"" in early high school as I'm sure most kids did, and the movie puts a clever spin on the tale. Alicia Silverstone is surprisingly good in her role, perfectly playing a blond bombshell without a brain but a good heart - only Reese Witherspoon has done such a good job recently at portraying the west coast bimbos. (No offense to the west coast bimbos out there.) The movie's director, Amy Heckerling, has always been rather reliable on the whole and her direction is solid here - she could have turned ""Clueless"" into a crude, unfunny sex comedy with little wit or brains, but instead she takes a rather dubious idea for a film and transforms it into a well-made, well-acted, funny, inspired, lively, witty satire.Much better than expected."
"3688","Clueless",9,"We liked it as a family","Everyone in my family liked this movie, me, wife and kids, ages 13 and 10. A couple of hot flaunting parts made me enjoy, the fashion and lines inspired my wife and the kids laughed and thought she is witty and well put together. Of course, my son was natural and was ogling her and my daughter was figuring out how to be popular. We watched from home but would def have gone to theater if it was a new film and the cinema was open. It is hard to find movies that we can enjoy as adults and children and Clueless is one. I see there are poor reviews, which I attribute to fat bottomed women."
"3689","Clueless",7,"Funny and bright","I had seen it back when it was aired as I was a teenager, thus, the perfect target. I remembered it as being entertaining.
I then moved to England and as I found interest in English culture, I became aware of Jane Austen´s ´Emma´many adaptations, and this one was in the list. I must say that I was clueless myself. Out of curiosity, as I feel a bit ´too old for this stuff´now, I watched some extracts to try to remember what the story was about. And, yes, it is adapted to our 90´s but the clues are the same.
What makes this film different from a typical teenage one is that it is capturing the humour from Jane Austen´s book and bringing it to the 20th century. Alicia Silverstone does the perfect job of making this ´shallow rich pretty blond´ funny, vulnerable and good hearted. As to the ´teenage stories´, the extract that I watched again showed me that no matter how old we are, human nature is the same. Don´t be ashamed to enjoy it even if you are over your 20s as nobody really grows, we only evolve and this film is completey in Jane Austen´s spirit of catching personalities that will always remind us of someone we have met (or are yet to meet)."
"3690","Clueless",7,"Good fun, but that's all","I've seen this teen movie countless times, and it's still enjoyable to watch. The jokes do wear thin after several viewings, but it is still a funny film. The cast are all very good, although I do find Brittany Murphy slightly irritating. The plot isn't very deep, but at least it is there, as many teen movies lack this vital feature. I am a little worried about the characters only being 15/16 and acting extremely maturely for their ago, however that seems to be the only problem with this movie.
7/10"
"3691","Clueless",9,"Charming comedy that's much smarter than it pretends to be, much like it's heroine","1990s high school set version of Jane Austen's ""Emma"" is pretty irresistible, thanks to writer/director Amy Heckerling's likable portrayal of young people and even more so thanks to an incredibly endearing performance by Alicia Silverstone. Silverstone's Cher is blond, beautiful, and the most popular girl in school, and who takes it upon herself to fix the lives of everyone around her (i.e. helping a new girl get popular, playing matchmaker with unhappy teachers, etc.), even if it's to serve her own ends. What intrigued me most upon rewatching the film is that Cher is the type of character who is usually the villain of these sort of films, but in this film she's the likable heroine. ""Clueless"" is also unique in that there really are no antagonists or villains, with the possible exception of Silverstone manipulating the lives of everyone around her, but although her actions are self serving at times, she's never mean or cruel, allowing the audience to still like her character. Cher is a unique character who plays at being a cute ditzy girl, but who is secretly (maybe even to herself) much smarter than she appears, which paved the way for copycat characters like Elle Woods in ""Legally Blonde"" or Romy & Michele or even Cameron Diaz' character in ""Charlie's Angels."" One might argue that Marilyn Monroe did this in some of her film, but the ditzy blond was more of her real-life act. I'm thinking the closest cinematic predecessor would be Holly Golightly form ""Breakfast at Tiffany's"" but that film was tonally very different that characters manipulations were quite different. But I digress. Likable performances in ""Clueless"" are not limited to Silverstone and extend to the cast as a whole. Two standouts are Brittany Murphy as Silverstone's Eliza Doolittle to her Professor Higgins, and a young Paul Rudd play's Silverstone's college age stepbrother, who she describes as he dresses funny and listens to ""complaint rock."" Following this film Rudd could very easily have gone down the road of handsome leading man type of roles, but instead chose a different career path, which I think made him a more interesting of actor. While the cast deserves a lot of credit for the film's easy charm, writer/director Heckerling deserve credit for not only creating likable well rounded characters, she also fills the film with endless funny banter, such as:Josh: Do you have any idea what you're talking about?
Cher: No. Why, does it sound like I do?Or:Cher: Oh look, Josh is dancing with Tai, he never dances.
Christian: I can see why.Or:Cher: Would you call me selfish?
Dionne: No, not to your face.Or:Cher: If it's a concussion, you have to keep her conscious, okay? Ask her questions.
Elton: What's seven times seven?
Cher: Stuff she knows!Besides funny dialogue, Heckerling also has some fairly heartfelt dialogue that's sincere (and still funny) without ever becoming maudlin (SPOILER ALERT!):Everything I think and everything I do is wrong. I was wrong about Elton, I was wrong about Christian, and now Josh hated me. It all boiled down to one inevitable conclusion, I was just totally clueless. Oh, and this Josh and Tai thing was wigging me more than anything. I mean, what was my problem? Tai is my pal, I don't begrudge her a boyfriend, I really... Ooh, I wonder if they have that in my size. What does she want with Josh, anyway? He dresses funny, he listens to complaint rock, he's not even cute... in a conventional way. I mean, he's just like this slug who hangs around the house all the time. And he's a hideous dancer, I couldn't take him anywhere. Wait a second, what am I stressing about? This is like, Josh! OK, OK, so he's kind of a Baldwin, but what would he want with Tai? She couldn't make him happy. Josh needed someone with imagination, someone to take care of him, someone to laugh at his jokes... in case he ever makes any. Then suddenly...Heckerling made her directorial debut with ""Fast Times at Ridgemont High,"" which was unique in it's honest depiction of teen life, and although ""Clueless"" is minus the explicit sex and drugs of Fast Times, the Clueless teens do live in a world that includes those real elements, but Heckerling makes it much more sweet and charming than Fast Times. The characters of Clueless are unique in that they are these sweet likable characters, but at the same time are not naive innocents. It's an interesting balance I realized I hadn't seen in many teen films, but I think it boiled down to the fact that the characters, while they do rib each other at times, are never mean, making the film incredible endearing. Also of note is the bright vivid photography by cinematographer Bill Pope (""The Matrix,"" ""Army of Darkness,"" ""Chasing Mavericks,"" ""Baby Driver"" etc.), who makes the colors pop and gives the film a pleasing looks and color scheme. Other supporting players of note include (now FoxNews commentator) Stacey Dash as Cher's best friend, Dan Hedaya as her high powered lawyer dad, Breckin Meyer as a skater dude, Wallace Shawn and Julie Brown as teachers, and ""Jaws"" screenwriter Carl Gottlieb as a priest. Lastly, I'm a huge fan of the General Public song Tenderness that's played over the film's finale and end credits, so it was kind of impossible for me not to fall in love with this movie. Overall, ""Clueless"" is a charming film that is much smarter than it pretends to be, much like it's heroine (how can a film that uses the ""Spartacus"" oysters and snails scene as foreshadowing be considered fluff?)."
"3692","Clueless",8,"Just as good watching it 22 years later!","Wow I remember watching this for the first time and falling in love with it. I recently watched it again and it's still a brilliant film and feels just as fresh and relevant now. Alicia is fantastic as Cher and plays the naive but loveable character beautifully. Brittany as Tai is fab and Paul Rudd as Josh is just gorgeous! You'd think you'd hate some rich, Beverly Hills girl for obvious reasons but you end up just really feeling for her as you get to know her as the film goes on. It's not crude and doesn't rely on gross or obvious stuff to get the laughs as the writing is just lovely and witty enough to not need those cheap ploys so often seen in teen movies. It really does stand the test of time. Fab!"
"3693","Clueless",7,"""We might get Marky Mark to plant a celebrity tree.""","A fun teen comedy from Amy Heckerling, the director of the woefully overrated Fast Times at Ridgemont High and the first two Look Who's Talking movies. Clueless is the best thing she's ever done, in my opinion. It put Alicia Silverstone on the map. Well, that and Aerosmith videos. Silverstone is pitch-perfect as Cher, the role of her career. It's impossible not to like her in this movie. It's also pretty much the best thing Stacey Dash and Breckin Meyer ever did. Not to mention the first big role for Paul Rudd. As most everyone knows, it's based on Jane Austen's ""Emma."" For a teen comedy, it's refreshingly smart. The story may not be all that but there's lots of good dialogue rather than a string of F-bombs or Stifler-like characters. One of the few memorable '90s comedies."
"3694","Clueless",9,"Immy's review : Iconic 90s film","One of my favourite 90s teen movies! It's so much fun and I never get bored of watching it. The characters have striking and loveable personalities, the dialogue is witty, the fashion and music is iconic.. what's not there to love? The movie is not dull or bland in places as we constantly follow the main antagonist (Cher) tackle and go through the hilarity and mishaps of being a teenager in California. I think that Cher is one of the best teen antagonists to have ever been written. Although she is rich, spoilt and popular, she's actually portrayed as a nice person. Although the movie never paints her as a saint, as she makes mistakes and acts selfishly in places, we watch her learn and grow from them whilst realising her own naivety and 'Cluelessness', making her not only a fun and infectious character to watch, but also relatable and therefore an admirable person. The movie also has a quirky and lovely charm to it that never fails to put a smile on your face throughout. I love the fact that although it's branded as a dumb teen movie, it's actually very clever and funny, and has a deeper meaning rather than being about some shallow teens. In fact, it paints teenagers in a fair and real way ; Naive, self obssessed, but sensitive and full of heart. All I can say is I think some of the teen movies today should watch and learn. I'm talking to you kissing booth."
"3695","Clueless",9,"A beautiful teen comedy","I decided to give this movie a watch out of curiosity since I wanted to see how it feels to be a 90's high school student in California. I was so amazed at how beautifully this film showcased high school life in the 90's. I feel all good after watching this movie.Alicia Silverstone looked very gorgeous in this movie. Her character was nicely written. This movie will make you fall in love with her if you haven't already. Paul Rudd was awesome in his role. Movies like this make me enjoy teen comedies although I'm not a big fan of the genre. The 90's was such a beautiful time when people actually spent more time outside interacting with each other rather than on gadgets.Overall it's a great movie and definitely one of my all time favourites. It's a nice take on Jane Austen's novel and I enjoyed every bit of it. This movie makes me miss my high school days and because of that it will always have a special place in my heart!"
"3696","Clueless",7,"Good movie, that was a mirror of its era","So if you're reading this in between a bunch of 1 ratings. You're probably wondering just what's going on? Why is it so loved. The movie is basically a reflection of the young Gen X era (more importantly how it's perceived). people also missed the classic 80s teen films and this was a bit of a jump back to that.
Most of the 1 reviews are from people born 10 years later who NEED to tell you it's based on Emma (because they're smart and have google). They also have to show they're completely against commercialism in all its forms (and again knew before you that this film is based on a Jane Austin book).
They're not watching the film for what it is. It's not trying to be Citizen Cane. Simple movie dealing with being a teen (a very rich teen) in the 1990s. Easy."
"3697","Vivarium",5,"Could have been a 30mins tv episode","Got a half decent idea for a short tv episode (but hey... leave out the cuckoo opening scenes then, no need to spell out the whole thing beforehand) but as a feature it's just an amateurish mess without much thought, balance in it's storytelling or coherence behind it (and yes it is ""surreal"" but that doesn't make it any better)"
"3698","Vivarium",7,"Like many works of art, you'll either get it, or not...","There are many artworkss I have come across I don't understand, or that grate on my eyes and ears, but I could never say 'this is the worst I've ever come across, I want my money or time back.' I just acknowledge I don't understand it and move on. The rhetoric used in many reviews here (and on other titles here) is nothing short of churlish and immature. I hope people with more rational minds can ignore the cancel culture reviews, use better judgement as to whether this film is worth their time or money and give equally fair reviews.That being said, I've given this a 7 (a 'good' but not 'great' in my personal estimation, your mileage may vary) and recommend this highly to lovers of noir fantasy/science fiction parables, or bleak social commentary framed in a Carrollian/Kafka-esque/David Lynch set-up. Many others, like me, may probably like, enjoy or appreciate it to varying degrees, but shouldn't 'hate' it.The two leads (Eisenberg and Poots) are quite up to the demands their predicament puts on them, and show a varied range of emotions and states. The supporting child actor, however, gives me the willies! If that wasn't his normal voice I was hearing, his mannerisms, posture and acting were still scarily on-point. (If that was his voice, however, his career should skyrocket.) As a 'family' their dynamic is both an exaggerated mirror of modern unprepared families, as well as a starkly portrayed descent into madness.Set design and overall production quality was obviously low-budget but very effective nonetheless. It perfectly evokes the subliminal nausea that modern suburbia often instills. You are asked to pay more attention to the tasteless food, the cookie cutter clouds and the pictures on the walls to better understand the complete lack of emotion or creativity of the antagonists, how completely different a species they are.The script is the only thing I knock a point off for. While it didn't do anything 'wrong', per se, I can agree with some reviewers that maybe, just maybe, some kind of clarification, exposition or slightly less bleak ending would make it more palatable to a much wider audience, but then we would be as remiss as if we asked Picasso to paint the whole face, or Jackson Pollock to join some of the dots up and give us a clue... Sadly, therefore, the point lost is for my own (and others) lack of vision or understanding, not the Writer/Director's ability."

"3700","Vivarium",6,"Black mirror episode with no spice","The way this movie played out and ended felt very similar to a black mirror episode that felt like it's missing something.... there are a lot of great things in this movie (performance, cinematography, color scheme) but it doesn't make up for the one thing it lacks- excitement. Honestly watching this movie made me feel like I ate a big meal and I'm full from it but it wasn't what I was craving and overall bland. I have this feeling that the point of this movie is to make you feel like nothing. make you feel melancholy and/or depressed. It really makes you question your existence, your place on earth, if perfection is really what we crave and if life really matters, so it did achieve its goal however it probably could have been slightly more entertaining but then maybe it wouldn't have been as effective? It's a tough grey area. I probably wouldn't watch it again or recommend it to someone who's depressed. If you like unique artsy surreal films give it a go but don't expect too much. (Excuse my horrible grammar and spelling)"
"3701","Vivarium",7,"Relies on Style, Atmosphere and Metaphors","The 27th March of 2020 is a good day, a decent day, a day to enjoy a fresh Jesse Eisenberg double feature - ""Resistance"" and ""Vivarium"". The latter proved to be an entertaining and thoughtful parable in the atmospheric and thematic traditions of ""The Twilight Zone"", yet not without its flaws and misses.""Vivarium"" is almost entirely based on a metaphor/s, a parable of an often-used theme, a story that knows what it wants to say but, despite a nice flow of inventiveness, can't keep it consistently substantial. The vert first minutes, the intro sequence, heavily foreshadows what ideas are to follow without even using any characters yet. Later on, there are points where the commentary is perhaps too obvious and spoon-fed. Rushed-in family-hood, the challenges of parenthood, ownership and more similar ideas are presented and worked into a dystopian, lab-rat-like environment. There's a decent dose of humor injected in it as well, the more grim kind. The movie plays off its cast's content and realistic little performances, a top-notch, eye-pleasing production design and various atmosphere-setting devices, trying to be an intriguing survival drama that's swimming around the surface while continuously hinting on a something deeper. The deeper never truly comes. ""Vivarium"" succeeds at being a drawn-out episode of what could be an anthology horror series, but as a full feature it lacks additional components. For the most part, it is enough with the presented themes, the distressing and messed up character's new routine and the fantastic, mysterious elements surrounding it, but... ""Vivarium"" has got style, but half-way through it slowly ceases to be enough & as a climax we receive... even more style. Basically, as far as atmosphere, special effects and indie arthouse creativity goes, ""Vivarium"" is a great little flick worth seeing, but chances of eventual underwhelment are there.For anyone who loves oddball indies, mysterious concepts, metaphors, borderless creepiness and what people call ""Twilight Zone-esque"", ""Vivarium"" is a journey worth taking. Should it succeed, thoughts might be provoked. My rating: 7/10."
"3702","Vivarium",7,"I hate this kind of movie......... but........","What a weird, odd but somehow enthralling movie. It really should have been boring but somehow it kept me interested the whole time. I'm not sure why. And it's the kind of movie I usually hate because you get no real answer at the end. Theres a lot of things that maybe they were trying to say about suburbia life and such, maybe trying to be artsy, but I never really care about that kind of thing, yet again I liked it.Maybe it's got to do with the isolation part. I watch this and think hey, our isolation ain't bad. If you haven't seen it and you like quirky weird movies give it a whirl, might grab you like it did me."
"3703","Vivarium",4,"Ohhhh Kayyyy","Weird only for the sake of being weird. I'm easy on movies/people's creative efforts. I usually hand out 8s, 9s, and 10s as if they were Gummy Bears and Blo-Pop suckers for the kids on Halloween. On the rare occasion where I do dip below 5 stars I most often do what my mother always told me to do. If I can't say something nice...I don't say anything at all. And yet, here I am. Disappointed in the movie after 97 minutes of hoping it would offer some appreciable redeeming or artistic value (I strongly hesitate to criticize its artistic value since I myself can barely cut and paste) only to be sadly disappointed by its emptiness. How bad could it be I reasoned? After all my boy Jesse Eisenberg is in it and most of his movies are usually 8s... Aren't they?
Sorry, but I will not take the time to describe the storyline or plot to you. Instead I will recommend that you see the trailer on YouTube to get the feel and flavor of this movie and keep in mind that what you see is what you get. And that's all."
"3704","Vivarium",1,"What an utter waste of time :-\","Although the film is creatively pretty well made and keeps you on the edge, well. almost until the last 12 mins or so, it is a MASSIVE waste of an anti-climax. Do not waste your time whatsoever. It leads to NOTHING. Literally nothing. And you'll be left with nothing but a weight of regret of wasting your last hour and more. Blasphemously disappointed. because I kept expecting an epiphanous moment LOL!"

"3706","Vivarium",8,"Strangely entertaining","I liked it, I like that they've shown us something different from the norm, something a little odd. I was glued to the screen, captivated, it's a mystery but it's one that you'll be saying TF!. If you like reading or viewing some of Stephen king now and then, then you too could probably appreciate the movie for its surrealty value. The movie does have a message too, however, it's a bit bleak but it is there, you could say it's somebody's metaphor/anxieties about suburban-life."
"3707","Vivarium",7,"This is a solid film","Objectively, this movie is well thought out, acted, and shot. The plot quite honestly creeped me out and gave me nightmares (no kidding, the child in this movie filled me with a nameless dread) but it is absolutely worth a watch, which puts it into a category of about 8% of films on the market (imho). Imogen Poots takes us through the film bad mushroom trip version of what the climax of interstellar was for a good DMT trip, if that makes any sense. Jesse Eisenberg captures the dread of a colorless, myopic existence. This film was sort of indescribable. All the more anxiety inducing watching this during the COVID-19 pandemic."
"3708","Vivarium",9,"Fantastic Nihilist Nightmare","Don't listen to those dullard consumers that have been brought up on a steady diet of bangs and flashes. This isn't a mainstream film, rather it resembles a play, which gives a nod to Samuel Beckett's ""Waiting for Godot"". With it's limited cast, static set design and dreamlike colours and soundtrack, I found myself mesmerised by every detail of this surreal little odyssey. It's necessary to absorb the atmosphere and dread of the existential nightmare that unfolds in order to enjoy the way it gets inside your head and alters your mood. Personally this is exactly the kind of movie which doesn't make me feel that I've wasted an evening. You can keep your guns and explosions, this is the closest I've felt to visiting a theatre since it's been impossible to do so. If you enjoyed The Twilight Zone as a kid this will feel nostalgic, though I sense it makes a bigger comment on the psychology of being human, or perhaps isolated... perfect for the times. Well done actors and designers. No it won't be for everyone, but I loved it."
"3709","Vivarium",1,"Dumb","First, I really appreciate risky movies, that's why I watched this. Now, I can say is one of the worst movies I've ever watched. The scenes that the boy was screaming all the time were a real nightmare. Boring nonsense from beginning to end.
So, if you're in a lockdown like me, just go to fix anything at home instead watching this."
"3710","Vivarium",10,"Weird and wonderful","Just because you don't understand something doesn't automatically make it crap. It makes you a lazy and ignorant reviewer of movies and film. David Lynch once said, ""It's better not to know so much about what things mean. Because the meaning, it's a very personal thing, and the meaning for me is different than the meaning for somebody else."" If you agree with this statement, try this movie on for size. If not, go back to watching reality television."
"3711","Vivarium",10,"Like an extended episode of the Twilight zone. ..","Love dark comedy horror movies like this, ya never know where it's going, or where it'll end up, it's the weird voyage that makes the journey so unique. This is definitely a strange oddity and in my opinion worth the voyage! Can't believe all the negative reviews, this movie is different but that should be a good thing. ..thought it to be an interesting story and found myself entertained from beginning to end. ..the ""mutant kid"" common that was genuinely funny and disturbing at the same time.. .not to mention the relationship that unused between all the characters involved. ..the movie stayed true to its premise, which is one of the reasons I cannot understand why most of the reveiws were so negative. ..i mean, from the trailer to the cover art , conceptually remained true to what it was. Cannot imagine what was otherwise expected or not expected on to which the movie doesn't deliver. It was well executed with a kinda Twilight zone or tales from the darkside atmosphere. .. with only the 3 main characters and a whole lot of houses that look exactly the same. .. I thought it was a great flick with good acting, likeable characters (except for the mutant man child) lol. Even the look of this film had a crazy nostalgia, a sorta mystique that keeps you invested in its journey. ..ima hava say, think it was A very good and genuinely different blend of dark comedy, horror, and maybe some disturbing Sifi wit a
Twist of lemon. ..i really liked it. Think beetlejuice meets after hours. ..or if beetlejuice had a kid and tricked you into raising it as your own...or if the exorcism failed and you were stuck with a demon to raise!!!"
"3712","Vivarium",1,"A plot lost in its own labyrinth","I had a lot of expectations in the start but as the play went on, things begin to fall apart horribly.

"3714","Vivarium",10,"Absolutely loved it!","This film is so unique and many ways. Probably one the best I've seen in a while, I don't understand how this got so much hate. The idea is so original, I've always wanted to see a movie like this. The acting was great, I was left feeling so creeped out from time to time but I was also so curious to see what happened next, it was so unpredictable. I absolutely loved it. I also recently watched the movie 'The Art Of Self Defence, starring both Jesse Eisenberg and Imogen Poots, also. These are two both great films and these two actors need to do more films like these!"

"3716","Vivarium",8,"Endless","Some things are way too good to be true. And sometimes you might find yourself in a situation that you are not going to be able to escape from (no pun intended). Having said that the movie asks you to suspend your disbelief. If you can do that this is quite the nice movie, with a lot of social and general human commentary. What is expected of us, what we expect from us and what life can be about - or rather what we make of it.Is it all for nothing? Are we moving forward, are we creating, are we actually changing anything? All things that can be seen here, if one wants to see them. And more, while this is slow burning, it also is quite classy. That will not make it better for those who will be bored with it all, but those who will cherish it, will love it too"
"3717","Vivarium",6,"Interesting premise, dull main characters","I found this movie very interesting at the beginning, the creepy characters and atmosphere, the mystery, the whole setting is very well achieved.
Even the characters acted decently at the beginning, but they quickly became dull and stopped doing anything to help themselves.
They quickly break down and basically lay down and rot.
They could have done so much more, if they did, the movie could have been so much better. No need to change the ending, I think that even if it's very predictable, it makes sense and is good, but the middle, the two characters being in the situation is what fell flat.
It could have been so much better, but it's not a bad movie."

"3719","Vivarium",2,"When you can't write more than one line of script.","It's basically a failed Truman show with no plot development.
Nothing happens after the first 20 minutes, no ideas are put into pictures, I'm actually surprised that the movie is even able to show us anything, it does a good job at sustaining its own emptiness.The actors act, the camera work. Unfortunately that's not enough to make a movie. A movie needs a story, and a story is something more than setup.
These guys need to add some steps to their writing process.Don't watch. Or just watch the trailer. Honestly it should just be a trailer, because there is nothing more in the movie."

"3721","Vivarium",7,"Metaphors, blah, blah, blah. It's a slow-burn bad acid trip from the 70's","A lot of filler, for such little substance. I get it, most people will get it, some wont, some wont care. But if one of the unearned clichés of suburban dwellers is the supposed lack of critical thinking and a requirement for spoon-feeding of information, Vivarium does little to suggest that it believes any differently about its audience. There's more hand-me-down genre movie tropes, than recognizable human behavior in this film. And I certainly didn't need a 97 min dose of it. This Irish, Danish and Belgium collaboration felt more like a slow-burn bad acid trip from the 70's. However, the cinematography and score were perfection, as were the stylized sets and performances by Poots and Eisenberg, and my rating going all towards those qualities. If you're a fan of stylized satirical indie arthouse psychological sci-fi noir genres, you will appreciate and possibly enjoy this one. Not even close to a 10, but certainly not worthy of anything less than a 5. It's a 7/10 from me."

Did anyone even edit this film? Rey's character was not likable. The only person tolerable was Chewie. Leia died of shame. Nothing happened anyone cared about. The dialogue was not clever. The film never went anywhere at all. It was just endless scenes of magical occurrences. People galloping on horses (read that again). Magic over kill.

Judd often talks about how the key to making a good comedy is to make a good drama and add humor to it, this is the perfect example.Pete's story is intriguing and feels completely worthy of a movie like this. Some people wanting a non stop laugh fest maybe not like it, and it does have flaws, but I really enjoyed it.This is probably Judds best movie in 10 years. And I highly recommend giving it a watch."

Not many films I've seen recently left me feeling that way; especially Davidson's previous film ""Big Time Adolescence"". ""The King of Staten Island"" was funny, heartfelt, and raw at times. Personally, I've always felt like Pete Davidson was the least funny member of SNL, but this film opened my eyes to what he was about as a person and where his comedy stemmed from. I appreciate that the film doesn't pretend to be something different than what it is - Pete's semi-biographical story brought to life by a comedy directing/producing pro, Judd Apatow. The supporting cast of Marisa Tomei, Bill Burr, and Steve Buscemi bring some pretty great performances to the table as well. Great story about that weird part of life in your early twenties where you're still not really sure what you're doing or where you're going on life's journey. It deals with living through loss, growing up and finding out your purpose in the world. I will recommend this to friends!"

"3751","The King of Staten Island",10,"Relatable, Real, and Heartfelt.","Bill Burr and Pete Davidson are an amazing duo. I know this is not a type of movie where they would have a part 2. But I would throughly enjoying watching this story continue on with all these characters. It was a little long but you would really feel the emotion between Bill and Pete."
"3752","The King of Staten Island",7,"Flaws Aside, It's a Funny, Wholesome and Relatable Experience","It is a fine day for something funny, relatable and wholesome & ""The King of Staten Island"" delivers a rather enjoyable package in that department. Judd Apatow's most famous include ""The 40-Year-Old Virgin"" (which I loved) and ""Knocked Up"", and the last before last, whole 5 years ago, was ""Trainwreck"", which I happened to catch on the big screen, it was okay but not a fan... This time around Apatow directs a story co-written with its standout star Pete Davidson, dedicated to his dad Scott Davidson, and quite heavily inspired by Pete's own life. Though not without its flaws, I can tell You ""The King of Staten Island"" is easily my favorite Judd Apatow piece since 2005.To most probably known as a member of SNL, now rising comic, actor and cool dude Pete Davidson is portraying Scott, a 24 year old who has been a case of ADD ever since his firefighter dad died when he was seven. Jobless and living with mom, Scott spends his days smoking bud, hanging out with friends and dreaming of being a tattoo artist. When some new characters enter his life, he is forced to grapple grief, trauma and take his first steps towards redemption. In real life, Pete Davidson's father was a firefighter who died in the line of duty, rescuing victims of the 9/11 attack. Cast member Steve Buscemi used to be a firefighter in the wake of the 80's, and returned to help on the day of the same tragedy.""The King of Staten Island"" is mainly a story about growing up, finding the good things, learning to accept those good things, and taking responsibility over one's life. There's genuine sentiment in its heart, which rests in just the right place, and it can also be legitimately funny. It's not structurally perfect, and can feel a little too scenic, focusing on the quality of separate sequences that do not add a lot of story. The big turning point starts manifesting itself as late as 100 minutes into the movie, and in the end the 2 hour and 17 minute runtime is a little too tall. Having said that, it is a dramedy that's never boring, always pleasantly amusing. This kind of plot, I believe, is pretty predictable by default, so enjoy the substitute, the always-present-low-key-charm. As a 23 year currently stuck in my hometown and great friends with Mary Jane, I felt like an appropriate audience member for ""The King of Staten Island"", and that's what I meant with ""relatable and wholesome"". Some might say that a big part of this movie isn't about a whole lot of anything, but I beg to differ, perhaps the idyllic view on such simplicities tells a lot.I think it's apparent Pete Davidson is a pivotal part of why the movie works so well. In what might very likely be his best performance to date, he plays a likeable, decent guy with a good heart and some troubles in it, plays him so authentically one could guess some of it comes from a place of past pain. But that's not it, the supporting cast delivers well above average performances as well - do not miss the chance to see Bill Burr in a bigger role and rocking an impressive moustache, and the female counterparts for both - Bel Powley and Marisa Tomei, anchor the balance perfectly.Judd Apatow is arguably one of Hollywood Heavyweights, making a film with a cast that don't fall back all that much, so the level of these ingredients resemble themselves also in every technical and aesthetical department. It's visually very well orchestrated, subtle and perfect in its simplicity, never once anything distracting catches the eye. Soundtrack has a couple of real nice tunes in it, of which one dear-to-my-heart nostalgia song ended the film, but I won't spoil it.Even now I wonder why not more, because I really, really dug it, but I believe that it deserves a good, flavorful, perhaps even memorable 7/10. I recommend it, well, just about everyone who's not too young for it, even one point of intrigue is enough."
"3753","The King of Staten Island",9,"More of a great film than just a great comedy","King of Staten Island is a deeper dive into Pete Davidson, a mostly autobiographical look at why he is the way he is. Well done and well written and a great supporting cast from Bill Burr, Marissa Tomei and Steve Buscemi all were steller in supporting roles.Be prepared, it is dark and not funny ha-ha, but definitely uses humor to deflect uncomfortable situations. Pete's always been an intriguing character to me, so this was a great way to pull the layers back, it's not always pretty, but I think it is definitely worth the price."
"3754","The King of Staten Island",9,"Original and heartwarming","This films intention, is to take you on a journey. It presents itself initially, as a simple character study. As it divulges though. You begin to see that it's actually an examination of the people that interact with the lead and how they effect and are effected by his actions.The quick cuts and edits are a perfect representation, of the ebb and flow of real life and are in no way unintentional or a mistake.The premise and subject matter is not easily digested but at the core is a story of a young man stricken by grief who wants to contribute and find where he belongs.Funny, heartwarming, original and will leave you satisfied after viewing"
"3755","The King of Staten Island",8,"Fresh Writing & Star Turn for Pete Davidson","I'll be honest...I liked this movie way more than I expected I possibly could. Pete Davidson is great in this and the film is well-written, funny, and touching. Highly recommended weekend viewing."
"3756","The King of Staten Island",10,"Relatable in ways I wasn't prepared for...","I was excited about this movie simply because it's an Apatow product, AND, I'm a somewhat, ""new"", fan of Davidson. I cried through the first viewing, laughed more, but still cried, through the second viewing of my 48hr rental. Well done. Thank you for sharing your story in such a cerebral, human way. I will purchase it as soon as it's available for purchase."
"3757","The King of Staten Island",5,"A good cast but the story was too boring","I enjoyed the cast and was mildly looking forward to this film. But it was way too long and didn't really achieve anything. The love interest. The father and son thing. Living at home. And the mums new boyfriend. But I didn't care about any of it.There are some funny lines in this. Some caring interactions. And an attempt to do things different. But it was a long slog to get to the end. Then when the end did come it really wasn't worth the wait.This is watchable but you won't get too much from it. I suspect a lot of the high ratings here are PR campaign boosters. This is not a high scoring film at all. Disappointing."
"3758","The King of Staten Island",5,"Wait until it's free","Three big problems:
1) Pete Davidson's acting was very distracting - Everyone else was great, but his reactions didn't match their actions.
2) Pete's character was way too much of a self-pity cliche - ""Meh, I'm broken, please feel bad for me.""
3) Forgettable - Nothing deep, special, or very interesting happens, and there's not enough funny to make up for it."
"3759","The King of Staten Island",10,"Ol' Billy Hollywood","If you're in any way a fan of Pete Davidson or Bill Burr, see this movie. Both absolute crush it by pretty much playing themselves.
If you're not a fan of Pete, see this movie. He'll completely change your mind. The anorexic panda that he is."
"3760","The King of Staten Island",9,"All Around Great Flick","Don't listen to some of the trolls who reviewed this film. Writing, acting, and directing were phenomenal. Very memorable movie. It's been a while since I've rooted for a main character so much. Great movie."
"3761","The King of Staten Island",2,"Kept waiting for it to get engaging","Wow did this movie drag. I kept waiting for it to get funny and engaging...but nope. On top of that, Pete was incredibly unlikeable. I kept waiting for his character to morph and learn...but it just didn't happen. Too bad though, I was really hopeful for this movie."
"3762","The King of Staten Island",NA,"Pete Davidson is a Participation Award.","I've liked some of Judd Apatow's films. I have not seen one thing that Pete Davidson has done that is good OR funny. Even on SNL his humor is sophomoric and imbecillic. Casting him in this feels like it was done more out of sympathy rather than talent. And this was not one of Mr. Apatow's finer writing efforts. Once Pete's tattoos start fading along with his 'career,' you'll likely catch him manning the fry station at Burger King."
"3763","The King of Staten Island",2,"Unwatchable... unfortunately.","I get the direction in which this movie was trying to go, but it missed horribly. I'm not going to blame any of the actors, but someone is to blame for this swing and miss. Under funded, and a completely unrealistic story... tried twice to watch it and couldn't do it. Really bad."
"3764","The King of Staten Island",5,"Way too long. 2+ hours","It's watchable when you have nothing to do, but it's wayyyyy too long. I feel like they lost themselves in totally unnecessary sub plots."
"3765","The King of Staten Island",2,"It's worse than a really bad movie because it thinks it's good","It's as if every actor here is in a different movie. They are different levels and you can feel it. The writing and story are okay, but there is such a lack of cohesiveness. It's very strange and the effect is a very uneven, unwatchable movie."
"3766","The King of Staten Island",1,"Narcissism Without Substance","Hard to sit through this ""film"" in its entirety. Ineffective one liners. Grungy looking characters. What a waste of time. I should have been paid to watch."
"3767","The King of Staten Island",2,"Such a solid 2.","I admit, only about 40min in before I just turned it off. Maybe good for someone from the area, but damn this movie was slow and boring, I think I smiled once, but other than that, this just felt very depressing without any real 'focus'If it cannot snag your attention in the first 10-15minutes, its likely not going to get a full view. Maybe next time?"
"3768","The King of Staten Island",5,"Disappointing","Just going off of the previews, I thought this was going to have a gritty, indie vibe. Way wrong, just a neutered PG film not worth your time or money. A lot of good acting from the support characters, especially Bill Burr, but the lead tall goofy actor (don't know his name, was told he's from SNL), is not a good actor. Someone with more talent might have been able to save this movie from being so dull. Tim Dillon probably could have pulled it off."
"3769","The King of Staten Island",4,"A masterclass in mediocrity","Don't let the fake, 1-week old accounts rating this 9's and 10's fool you, this is a stinker. File this under ""movies that didn't need to be made"". The King of Staten Island is slow, uneventful, but even worse it is a waste of a solid core cast of veterans. Unfortunately, casting Davidson, in what appears to be some sort of ill-advised vanity project, as the lead doomed this movie from the start. How Davidson landed a role on SNL is baffling enough, but how Apatow then thought he was fit to star on the big screen can only be explained away as Apatow owing Lorne Michael a big favor for some past transaction.The rest of the cast didn't fair much better, with the fiery (no pun intended) firefighter played by Bill Burr being the exception. Tomei, who is usually a guaranteed casting choice if for nothing else than the stability her experience provides, also falls flat. Perhaps that's due to the weak writing of which Davidson also took part, or perhaps the film just sucked the life out of her like it sucked the life out of me while watching it.
Finally, the pacing of the movie was sluggish, if not at a crawl at times, and the 2+ hour runtime starts to feel more like 4 hours. It's quite clear that a lot of reviewers (the real ones, not the brand new ones created solely to boost the film's rating) are trying their best to justify the fact that they spent $20 to watch this on their couch... That justification will likely never come for them, but it doesn't have to come for you.Skip this stinker. 4.3/10"
"3770","The King of Staten Island",7,"I'm conflicted","I'm conflicted because it was a truly likable movie. On the other hand the editing seemed rushed and all over the place. I really liked the idea of the film and I wish it was better executed. Regardless it was enjoyable"
"3771","The King of Staten Island",4,"Suicidal manchild","Remember that guy from HS who smoked dope and did his own tattoos. This is that loser at 30, living in mama's basement, playing video games all day and smoking weed. Two-hour pity parry"
"3772","The Big Ugly",3,"Very Disappointing !","I must admit when i saw the casting i was expecting at least some great moments of acting between the Trio Mac Dowell, Pearlman and Jones and i'm sorry to say i didn't have that.... This movie is bad from the core : the script is poorly written, there's is no good dialogue so no good acting moment possible between protagonists. Lots of useless scenes. The editing is lazy. The music choice is lame most of the time (all the time!). I watched it to the end hoping for something good happen to save it a little bit but it didn't come.... Very disappointing and very Boring... i put 3 stars for the 3 stars in it...."
"3773","The Big Ugly",4,"ugly mess","From the beginning there's lazy narration, lazy character introductions, nothing really happening.. the women are reduced to objects, the men just kinda grunt and barely do much. Some guy gets shot in a barn for seems like no reason at all. A movie is supposed to be visual/ moving... but the characters just sit around the whole time talking to each other about the same thing over and over. There's no real character goals. Who is the hero? Vinnie Jones or Nicholas Braun? Who is the villain? Junior or Ron Perlman? Really didn't know who to root for or against. Leven Rambin was very underutilized. I was expecting an awesome Vinnie Jones vs deliverance backcountry Appalachia, violent, action packed and instead got a snooze fest. Also I feel like The Gentlemen is basically the same movie idea but done much better and with way more clever dialogue and scenes."
"3774","The Big Ugly",5,"Two Smoking Barrels of Rye?","Hard-Guy Vinney, soccer-player-turned-actor just about acquits himself here. The W. Virginia location looked good, as did the contributions of his screen-partners Ron Perlman, as aged London gang-leader, ""Harris"" , and Malcolm McDowell, red-neck oilman's-leader, ""Preston"". The clash of culture between limey metropolitan gangster and backwoods oil-man, with an unexpected ecological & ideological tinge was always going to be a pretty difficult one - as it proved. The real disappointment here was the Plot, which started OK enough, but really was grasping for straws a long time before the last reel of film."
"3775","The Big Ugly",7,"Much better than I expected","I was initially interested in this because of an article about it being filmed in the area of Morehead, KY. Malcolm McDowell's son was so bored spending time in Morehead that he requested to go home rather than spend another night walking around in the local Walmart. I don't blame him.I started out watching out of morbid B movie curiosity, but eventually warmed up to the story. I've known guys like ""Junior"" IRL and in many movies.
Immediately upon meeting Junior, I knew this movie version would probably be getting his comeuppance in the end. However, I didn't know how everyone else's story would play out. There were a lot of small stories being woven into the picture and those are what kept me around. I don't feel it was time wasted.I think this is my first review. I only wrote it because I thought some of the others were much too harsh."
"3776","The Big Ugly",3,"I Really Wanted To Like This","Hey, there were 3 of my favorite actors - Vinnie Jones, Malcolm McDowell and Ron Perlman. In a gangster movie. How cool, I thought. In the end, it was not cool, a bit tepid. Started out well, the premise and the set up. Then it fell flat all the way, meandering through the plot, until the final shoot out. And even then, for those expecting a brutal, bullets flying, blood splattering violence between a vengeful hard man Vinnie and a badass Perlman, you're gonna be disappointed."
"3777","The Big Ugly",10,"slow with a big bang","This movie starts off slow and kinda boring but if you are a real movie fan, you can spot a movie that will not disappoint.
the characters are top class,btw the plot is not about junior,the ending is classic, makes you forget about the begining."
"3778","The Big Ugly",8,"Another Vinnie Jones Classic","Any movie with Vinnie Jones it it, you know it's good. I love his natural gangster style appearance and demeanor in his movies. Given his reputation of ""the toughest football player ever""... he is perfect in playing the villain.
Good to see legendary actor Malcolm McDowell still going strong. (Calligula, Clockwork Orange)This movie is a bit of a change to other Vinnie Jones movies... here he plays an aging gangster with a compassionate heart. A very good performance.This is not the best of this genre movie I have watched, but I do rank it up pretty high. I enjoyed it."
"3779","The Big Ugly",10,"Kick Ass","This movie was a lot of fun to watch. Great characters. Perlman, McDowell, and Jones do the heavy lifting, and fighting, as expected. But there is also an awesome supporting cast of characters that help color the plot and provide some great eye candy."
"3780","The Big Ugly",5,"Fantastic Actors with Questionable Production Choices","The Big Ugly Micro Review -First and most importantly Ron Perlman is absolutely fantastic. Vinnie Jones, Malcolm McDowell, and Bruce McGill are also all wonderful. Unfortunately, the film's positives end with its cast. The Big Ugly features a great setting with intriguing character relationships but fails to deliver on its promise of West Virginia Gangster Shakespeare.The Big Ugly has numerous questionable production choices. Interior bar scenes are filmed against bright large front windows blowing out the shot. The editing is extremely overworked bouncing around the room without motivation other than to give the appearance that talking about events is fast paced. The action that is portrayed in this genre gangster film is generic and forgettable lacking any personality.Perlman, Jones and McDowell elevate the quality of a film that would have been a complete disaster without their natural talent, charisma, and excitement. That's the disappointment aspect of The Big Ugly. The story idea is actually interesting with an upper class West Virgina Gangster family dispute. Unfortunately, the talent of the Big Ugly's actors are miles above the quality of the film."
"3781","The Big Ugly",6,"Loses its way","I actually quite liked it in many ways. The acting is pretty good. Ron Perlman is always awesome, and Malcolm McDowell is also great in the part of the old governor past his prime.Where it really works well is in their characters interaction towards the end. There's a real sense of people with their own honor and ties of friendship who are at odds suddenly. Honor, blind commitment, and ideals of justice are all tested.The problem with the movie as a whole is the plot falls apart after the first half, especially in the last 20 minutes. There are quite a few earlier scenes where I had to suspend disbelief as to how people would act in those situations, but the ending is pretty much unbelievable and tested that suspension too far.Good acting and cinematography, but not enough plot ideas unfortunately to prevent the holes showing."
"3782","Jumanji: The Next Level",8,"Still amazing, more silly jokes and chaos on the screen!","Before going to the cinema to see «The Next Level» of Jumanji, I rewatched the first movie, just to refresh my memory. And after watching the new one, I must say - it wasn't underwhelming at all!In addition to what the first film brought, new «Jumanji» has:
more jokes;a whole lot of new characters;a fresh look at the existing characters;plenty of new locations and thus, much more adventures;an absolute muddle of what's happening on the screen;and yes, even more jokes!Given the above, it's time to wrap it up - «Jumanji: The Next Level» is a solid following of a 2017's movie. It's all about laughter, fun, amusement and adventures, of course. In case if you seen «Jumanji: Welcome to the Jungle» and enjoyed it, the new «Next Level» won't let you down."
"3783","Jumanji: The Next Level",8,"Great sequel and laugh fest, the new Jumanji knows what its doing","Mild, mild spoilers ahead....I was scared they'd somehow screw up the sequel to the ""reboot"" they did, but I was greatly surprise at the new elements they added: the grandpa's subplot and the way it was executed and their contribution to the jumanji gaming experience (they were both hilarious); and all the new additions felt exactly how a sequel to a 90s sequel game would feel like: new abilities and weapons and scenery (or the would-be ""levels"" of the game) they still felt like they'd actually be levels of a game! It's exactly what I hoped they'd add on because that's the kind of thing the first movie did, it tried to work with the stereotypes and elements found in those good old adventure games like Tomb Raider.I also liked that they brought back the WHOLE gang, the reason why movies like this where the most logical thing would be to make it anthologic, that is, with different kids experiencing the game; so when they try to use the same characters that supposedly learned something from their past experience in it, is a recipe for disaster because it's hard to bring all the gang together without it being forced. But i liked the way they did it, it felt controlled and fulfilling in the end.In conclusion, it was a funny, entertaining and creative action adventure movie, it's not gonna win any Oscars but it's so wrll thought of that it's a delight to watch and I feel it never grows old, you can rewatch it and enjoy it all over again"
"3784","Jumanji: The Next Level",7,"Level up.","Even though its central concept seems ever-so-slightly more strained this time, 'Jumanji: The Next Level (2019)' is about as good as its predecessor. In fact, it's sometimes even better. Basically, the flick is just fun. The crowd-pleasing body-swapping is amped up to eleven, shaking things up just enough so that they feel fresh. The main actors continue to properly impress in their chameleon-like roles, joined by a few extra treats that perform far better than you'd perhaps expect. Indeed, these new players are probably its biggest asset; a couple of them thoroughly perforate the entire experience despite only having a rather small amount of screen-time. The picture is often funny - though, never hilarious - and is oddly endearing, to boot. It isn't particularly deep or, even, memorable but it doesn't need to be. It's a good time at the movies; what more do you need? Obviously some better theming and, perhaps, a tad of nuance wouldn't go amiss, but it's just not that kind of film really and that's perfectly fine. Even if it doesn't impact you as much as some of the year's best, it'll certainly make you smile and keep you entertained for a couple of hours. Besides, its inciting incident is driven purely by character and it even manages to squeeze some genuine emotional connection, via a well-drawn dynamic between DeVito and Glover, into its otherwise otherworldly proceedings. Its acting is also deceptively simple but decidedly fantastic, fully immersing you in the idea that these major stars are actually four teenagers and two old men. Basically, it's not as simple as you might think. 7/10"
"3785","Jumanji: The Next Level",8,"Suprisingly, funnier than the first (imho)","To be honest, I don't have high expectation for the sequel but turns out it is exceeded all of my expectations.Jumanji: The Next Level added new character, skills, and jokes for all of us. I could hear the audiences in the cinema laugh on the jokes and enjoy it as much as my boyfriend and I enjoyed it. Yeah, I have to admit there were some repeated patterns from the first one but along the way they also added several stuffs which brought fresh air to the whole movie.Also, I think the sequel conveyed deeper messages than the first one, potrayed by the characters problem in it, in which we can related to our real life. Lesson I got from this sequel: Sometimes you will hit the end but it doesn't mean it is over. It means, all you have to do is living the present and look it with different perspectives.From the plot of the story, it kinds of light and predictable, but hey, it is a decent sequel you can enjoy with your family. Side notes: They had after credits scene, it might hints about the potential third movie of Jumanji."
"3786","Jumanji: The Next Level",7,"More of the same, if that's good or bad is up to you","I thought the last Jumanji movie was pretty decent, not perfect, but definitely not bad. If you liked that one you will like this. It is very much just more of the same. If it ain't broke, you know.A couple new faces, one of them I really liked seeing. Won't say who it was, but if you're older than 20, chances are good you like the person.The action is like last time, it's entertaining, but not mind blowing. The effects are overall good. The Rock has some, lets call them punching scenes, which I liked. Although the action direction overall, could have been slightly better, tighter.They once again have fun with the fact that the characters ""in game"" represent characters in the movies ""real life"". And I am pretty impressed with how the actors fared. Maybe especially Dwayne Johnson. (I think he's taking some serious acting classes, he's getting better) Overall the cast in this is very likeable.I didn't feel quite that much that I was in a video game, this time around though. Felt more like just an adventure, than an adventure videogame. They could have hammered home a little better.
So yeah, I was entertained, but it's pretty shallow and won't stick with me like, say, the origianl Jumanji. (I watched that as a kid, and it was kind of revolutionary, so of course it stuck) Nice family flick."
"3787","Jumanji: The Next Level",7,"Enjoyable sequel","I absolutely loved the first instalment and to a large extent those that enjoyed the first will enjoy this it's still entertaining fast paced and humerous. The only thing I found was rather than laughing out loud and being on the edge of my seat like the first I had the occasional chuckle sat back. Having said that laughing out loud or not I was never bored and still had a smile on my face for the majority of the film. A decent sequel exiting at in interesting point for a potential 3rd movie."
"3788","Jumanji: The Next Level",8,"Just a good old fashioned fun movie","There are not many franchises which have been renewed recently which I have actually thought turned out well. Most have been done badly but I have to say that Jumanji stands out as an exception.This movie does not have a heavy deep story, doesnt try to be anything more than it is, this movie makes you laugh, keeps you entertained and ensures you leave the theater feeling happier than you went in.It wont win oscars but it will win your heart, definitely a movie to go and enjoy at this time of year."
"3789","Jumanji: The Next Level",8,"This was HILARIOUS!","I can't see how this movie was boring. You got the humor, the action, the excitement, the ACTING?! (and that ending tho...) This really was taken to the next level compared to the fist one. But that doesn't necessarily mean it's better. I don't know which I like better. The 2017 version is like the ""standard"" version of Jumanji introducing us to an amazing cast and filled with laughs. This movie builds on that concept and takes it further with a more diverse plot and new characters.
What I DID find dissapointing was that I felt that the fight with the villain was too short and over. But darn this movie was so FUNNY. I came out of the cinema with my stomach hurting because I laughed so much."
"3790","Jumanji: The Next Level",7,"Really really funny","The second film is way funnier than the first one. I thought by the first film that they could up the pace of the film to make it more exciting. This film had the right pace and it kept me excited for the whole film.
And I love the addition of Danny DeVito!"
"3791","Jumanji: The Next Level",8,"Better than the last","Took the wife and kids to see this and thought it was really funny and great for all ages. The rock and kevin hart just bounce off of each other and made the wife laugh more than me and a nice touch with danny devito and danny glover. My 8 year old thought it was better than the last and cant wait for the next film. Go take the family to see this and enjoy the ride"
"3792","Jumanji: The Next Level",5,"The old people angle got old","It didn't need Danny Devito or Glovers characters in it. Their characters inept way of understanding what was going on got old."
"3793","Jumanji: The Next Level",5,"First is better !","It is not so impressive as previous one. Character transformation is some way working not for all. Only Eddie's turn into Rock is highlighted part. Movie lost charm when Spencer back in Rock. Then story remains nothing. However funny dialogues surely will entertain you. Otherwise rest of movie is bore. I think previous one was better an interesting."
"3794","Jumanji: The Next Level",8,"5x Better than the first one, trust me!!","It has better action sequence n feels like a video games level design."
"3795","Jumanji: The Next Level",9,"Great and very funny","BEFORE WATCH, JUST REWATCH THE 1ST MOVIE FIRSTStoryline : great, funny and very entertaining but if you already watch the first movie then I suggest you must rewatch it first to remember it, if not maybe you will get a bit confuse.
Effect : great"
"3796","Jumanji: The Next Level",6,"Not so good","I really enjoyed the first movie but this one, not so much. The jokes seemed forced and not particularly funny. Even Dwayne Johnson's smouldering look wasn't funny this time around. At least Karen still looked beautiful as ever"
"3797","Jumanji: The Next Level",10,"Chekhov's Nunchucks","The Rock gives the best performance of Danny DeVito's career. Also, Chekhov's Gun shall hencforth be referred to as Chekhov's Nunchucks.What? You need more than that? Fine....Jumanji : The Next Level is a direct sequel to the 2017 Jumanji : Welcome to the Jungle which was a soft reboot of the 1995 film Jumanji.Spencer, the lead from the previous film is having a hard time at college and finds himself back in the video game Jumanji. However things don't go as planned and his friends have to jump back into the game to rescue him. This time the game also sucks in Spencer's grandfather, played by Danny DeVito and his old business partner Danny Glover (in the best role he's had in well over a decade).This time however, the players don't get to choose thier characters and this creates an interesting fish-out-of-water situation that the film employs to it's absolute best use. Moreover, the dual roles pull some surprisingly good impressions from our main video game cast and showcases a range you might not expect from stars like Dwayne Johnson or Terry Crews.Jumanji has a tricky line to walk. Adventure/Comedy is a tough sell, yet Jumanji manages to craft a rollicking good adventure with action and peril, while never completely abandoning the humor. There are of course a fair amount of cheap shots and pratfalls,
the movie does feature Jack Black after all. However there's a lot of smart jokes, and humor that doesn't rely on the lowest common denominator. It's exactly the kind of comedy that I love and it never lets up.Throughout the film, there's a lot of heart, exploring interpersonal relationships against the backdrop of the adventure and ends with a genuine punch the air moment. The film is unfettered by politics and agendas and may actually be the most fun I've had at the movies this year."

"3799","Jumanji: The Next Level",7,"Jumanji: The Next Level Review - A bit more character and a bit more heart provides for much improvement and variety","There was not much to expect from Jumanji: The Next Level. And frankly there isn't much more happening than the last time. However, it is the kind of treatment they went for this time.Karen Gillan gets a different character briefly and justifies it. Jack Black too gets a different character than before. But it is the new ""old"" characters which they added that works smoothly (with ""grease""). How they react and try to understand, takes up the majority of the runtime. That helps Dwayne Johnson and Kevin Hart to showcase and play with their characters. And all this is thought out so well that it is outright hilarious. Sure it was repetitive but writing and enactment is done so well that every time it landed into laughs. Everyone submerged into their respective characters very well.Action sequences were decent enough to keep you at the edge of your seat. The plot hadn't much but could have delved just a little deeper into two in-game characters than it did, which you'll know if and when you see.Other than that, it expands slightly more into the world building; you may or may not remember it later but you'll surely enjoy watching it. It definitely is a fun time at the theatre with your friends and/or family.However the nostalgia element that was till now missing in these reboot/sequel (s) is hinted at the end. So now I am curious to see how they handle the next obvious sequel, given how well they handled the new elements in this movie."
"3800","Jumanji: The Next Level",6,"Not as good as the 2017 version","Very slow story telling and not as good as 2017 version"
"3801","Jumanji: The Next Level",9,"Hillarious and Fun to Watch","This is a great example of how a good sequel should be. It doesn't take away the true essence of the movie but it gives much more creativity. When you love the first, for sure you are going to love it the same. It is just fun to watch and it's a type of movie that you can watch again another time for fun. I love all the characters inside, but on this one, Karen Gillan steal my attention the most, she has a very beautiful animated looks which is suitable for her character."

"3805","Jumanji: The Next Level",6,"Not bad, but not in the same class as the first.","It's an entertaining sequel. The effects and the story (in the game) were surprisingly good for a sequel. It also took entirely too long to get into the game.What brought the movie down a notch is the tired troupe of grandpa has to have everything explained 20 times. And the overdone old man routine. Ugh. It gave me flashbacks of Jar Jar Binks. That and a miscast Awkwafina - maybe it's just me, but I found her to be incredibly annoying.It is definitely NOT better than the last one, but isn't a flop either."
"3806","Jumanji: The Next Level",8,"As Good as a Sequel Could Be","While I do think the last film was superior this was still very well made. On the downside It was a bit more bloated, confusing and even the characters themselves didn't seem as invested in the plot. However, the chemistry between the characters is still great, the added cast is spectacular, and it is as wholesome as ever. It is a nice film to watch around Christmas."
"3807","The Shining",NA,"Best Horror Film I've Ever Seen","When this film first came out in 1980, I remember going to see it on opening night. The sheer terror that I experienced in viewing ""The Shining"" was enough to make me go to bed with the lights turned ON every night for an entire summer. This movie just scared the life out of me, which is what still happens every time I rent the video for a re-watch. I have seen The Shining at least six or seven times, and I still believe it to be simultaneously and paradoxically one of the most frightening and yet funniest films I've ever seen. Frightening because of the extraordinarily effective use of long shots to create feelings of isolation, convex lens shots to enhance surrealism, and meticulously scored music to bring tension levels to virtually unbearable levels. And ""funny"" because of Jack Nicholson's outrageous and in many cases ad-libbed onscreen antics. It never ceases to amaze me how The Shining is actually two films in one, both a comedy AND a horror flick. Ghostly apparitions of a strikingly menacing nature haunt much of the first half of the film, which gradually evolve into ever more serious physical threats as time progresses. Be that as it may, there is surprisingly little violence given the apparent intensity, but that is little comfort for the feint of heart as much of the terror is more implied than manifest. The Shining is a truly frightening movie that works symbolically on many levels, but is basically about human shortcomings and the way they can be exploited by unconscious forces combined with weakness of will. This film scares the most just by using suggestion to turn your own imagination against you. The Shining is a brilliant cinematic masterpiece, the likes of which have never been seen before or since. Highly, highly recommended. - Paul"
"3808","The Shining",NA,"A masterpiece of psychological horror","Stephen King may have said the master director knew nothing about horror, but that simply is not true. That is a too biased opinion for anyone to go on given that he wrote the book, which Kubrick based his wonderful film ever so loosely on. And at any rate, faithful or not, KUBRICK's Shining-the BEST crafted genre film of the 80's- performs it's duty as a fright flick, and then some.There are appropriately no words strong enough to convey the haunting beauty of the visuals showcased throughout the movie, from the drive to the Overlook to the final chase in the hedgemaze the movie is a feast for the eyes as it is for the mind. And it IS a feast for the mind as The Shining is as psychological as horror gets, toying relentlessly, and expertly with your emotions and expectations(some could even say SADISTICALLY), throwing something in that's completely out of left field and never, ever letting you catch your breath between the now classic shocks as the movie speeds toward it's memorable conclusion in the last half hour.Kudos are in order for Kubrick, a director of the old school style, who builds an eerie atmosphere by exercising total control over the filmic environment, manipulating everything down to the tiniest detail to suit the needs of the picture, yet filming with a coldly detatched, objective eye, as though Kubrick were making a documentary about these events. This would account for the dialouge, which-thankfully-is not the typical phoney balloney Hollywood banter (Kubrick detractors/King purists usually bitch about this the most, having been weaned on the phony nature of 'Hollywood talk', which is usually nothing at all like real talk. Many of us speak 'on the nose', and do not try to convey subtext through use of carefully chosen words that articulate our state of being without being direct.) In this light, Shelley Duvall must be commended for her performance which is very naturalistic. It does not seem like acting at all. She is not concerned with glamour, nor does she clutter her performance with typical acting chops, but rather she is solely focussed on hitting the emotional highpoints of her character as 'Wendy' gradually comes to realize that her husband is a madman. And let's face it folks, how many of us would like a million bucks when placed in a situation like that? Who does NOT look like a blubbering idiot when they are hysterical? That's what I thought, so what did you expect? She was great. To say nothing of the rest of the cast."
"3809","The Shining",9,"timeless terror","Even though The Shining is over a quarter of a century old, I challenge anyone to not get freaked out by Jack Nicholson's descent into madness. This is a rare example of something so unique that no one has been able to rip it off; instead it has been referenced time and again in pop culture. The twins, the elevator of blood, RedRum, the crazy nonsense ""writing""... this should be seen, if for nothing else, to understand all the allusions to it in daily life. The film is simultaneously scary, suspenseful, beautiful, and psychologically intriguing. It has the classic mystery of Hitchcock and the terror of a modern thriller. And it has what horror movies usually lack: a great script."
"3810","The Shining",9,"Amazing achievement in filmmaking and the art of terror.","Chilling, majestic piece of cinematic fright, this film combines all the great elements of an intellectual thriller, with the grand vision of a director who has the instinctual capacity to pace a moody horror flick within the realm of his filmmaking genius that includes an eye for the original shot, an ice-cold soundtrack and an overall sense of dehumanization. This movie cuts through all the typical horror movies like a red-poker through a human eye, as it allows the viewer to not only feel the violence and psychosis of its protagonist, but appreciate the seed from which the derangement stems. One of the scariest things for people to face is the unknown and this film presents its plotting with just that thought in mind. The setting is perfect, in a desolate winter hideaway. The quietness of the moment is a character in itself, as the fermenting aggressor in Jack Torrance's mind wallows in this idle time, and breeds the devil's new playground. I always felt like the presence of evil was dormant in all of our minds, with only the circumstances of the moment, and the reasons given therein, needed to wake its violent ass and pounce over its unsuspecting victims. This film is a perfect example of this very thought.And it is within this film's subtle touches of the canvas, the clackity-clacks of the young boy's big wheel riding along the empty hallways of the hotel, the labyrinthian garden representing the mind's fine line between sane and insane, Kubrick's purposely transfixed editing inconsistencies, continuity errors and set mis-arrangements, that we discover a world guided by the righteous and tangible, but coaxed away by the powerful and unknown. I have never read the book upon which the film is based, but without that as a comparison point, I am proud to say that this is one of the most terrifying films that I have ever seen. I thought that the runtime of the film could've been cut by a little bit, but then again, I am not one of the most acclaimed directors in the history of film, so maybe I should keep my two-cent criticisms over a superb film, to myself. All in all, this movie captures your attention with its grand form and vision, ropes you in with some terror and eccentric direction, and ties you down and stabs you in the heart with its cold-eyed view of the man's mind gone overboard, creepy atmosphere and the loss of humanity.Rating: 9/10"
"3811","The Shining",NA,"A classic horror from a master director","When Jack Torrance (Nicholson) is offered a job as winter caretaker for the Overlook Hotel he accepts it as an opportunity to work on his novel in an isolated environment. He is told stories of the last caretaker going mad and butchering his family but isn't deterred. He arrives at the Overlook Hotel with his wife (Duvall) and child Danny (Lloyd) and is shown around the hotel by the cook (Scatman Crothers) who has the gift of perception. The cook warns Danny that the hotel can be of particular danger for those with the gift. It's only a matter of time before Jack begins to act increasingly erratic.This is one of Jack Nicholson's finest roles, his increasingly unhinged character is amusing and terrifying in almost equal measures. Duvall plays the role of the terrorised wife quite well - she does look like she's genuinely filled with fear - but doesn't have much else to do. Lloyd is excellent as the boy, although he doesn't have too much emotion to express. However no doubt that this is Jack's show.The story doesn't stick to King's novel and is better for it; this is Kubrick's Shining. The film has plenty of genuinely scary moments but manages to keep a creepy atmosphere all through - especially as the ghosts come out and Jack begins to move between his reality and the reality that is gradually claiming him.Kubrick is excellent here, his cold direction adds to the overall creep factor of the film. It's one of the best examples of his masterful touch.Overall this is an excellent horror movie - because the focus is on horror and fear rather than gore alone (as with modern horrors). Jack is excellent in one of his best roles ever and the whole package is delivered in a cold creepy manner by a sadly lost director."
"3812","The Shining",NA,"Jack Torrance Meets David Bowman","What can I say about the scariest movie I have ever seen that has not already been said by others more articulate than yours truly?  Do not view this film expecting to see a screen version of the Stephen King novel. Rather, this is a Stanley Kubrick film, and to fully appreciate it one should judge it within the context of Kubrick's entire body of work as a serious filmmaker.  Thematically, THE SHINING relates most closely to 2001: A SPACE ODYSSEY, though flourishes of PATHS OF GLORY, A CLOCKWORK ORANGE and BARRY LYNDON do manage to figure prominently in the film's overall technique.In a nutshell (no pun intended), Jack Nicholson and Shelly Duvall co-star with Oregon's Timberline Lodge - enlisted to portray the exterior of the Overlook Hotel - in a story that appears on the surface to be about ghosts and insanity, but deals with issues of child abuse, immortality and duality. What the film might lack initially in terms of coherence is more than made up for in technique.  Garrett Brown (the male voice in those old Molson Golden commercials), inventor of the Steadicam, chases young Danny Lloyd through hotel corridors and an amazing snow maze, providing magic-carpet-ride fluidity to scenes that ten years earlier would have been impossible to accomplish.  If the film starts off too slow, remember who the director is.  This man likes to take his time, and the results are well worth it: incredible aerial shots of the Overlook Hotel; horrific Diane Arbus-inspired twins staring directly at us; portentous room 237 and its treasure trove of terrible secrets; elevators that gush rivers of blood in slow-motion; Jack Torrance's immortality found via the hotel (akin to David Bowman's journey through the Space Gate); and some of the best use of pre-existing music ever assembled for a motion picture.It would take a book to examine and defend the film's strong points and drawbacks.  If you've never seen it, you owe it to yourself to watch it alone with the lights off, with no interruptions, and make sure that it's raining.  This is a cinematic experience that changed my life at the age of 14.  Makes a great double feature with Robert Wise's 1963 thriller THE HAUNTING."
"3813","The Shining",5,"Overrated","Once again, I decided to check out a highly regarded ""cinematic masterpiece"" and was left kinda disappointed. Scariest movie of all time? No, not really. It wasn't even particularly scary.Admittedly, a lot of it was well done. The little girls were the best part. They were great. The steadicam shots through the hallways were pretty cool. There was a good sense of ""What horrors could be lurking around the corner?"" as the camera follows the kid through the halls.But aside from those things, much of the movie didn't work so well. Jack Nicholson was more hilarious than menacing. Was that intentional? His witty dialogue provided many laughs, but watching him slowly stumbling around holding an axe was hardly what I'd call horror.The story was completely nonsensical. What was any of that? There's no explanation for almost everything that happens in the movie! Here's where I'll probably get derided by the movie's fans for not ""getting it,"" but I'm convinced this is really a case where the movie-makers themselves had no clue what it all meant. They just threw all this random imagery at us just to confuse us and convince us that it's actually brilliant (because if we can't comprehend any of it, it must be brilliant, right?) but really it just makes zero sense.I don't get why this is so highly rated."
"3814","The Shining",NA,"Eeriness surpassed by class","Sometimes all good horror needs is a good idea. But sometimes, rarely indeed, a horror masterpiece will reach us by the hand of a Kubrick, with the adept, elusive touch of a great artist to guide the vision, and we know what separates it from all else.Okay, the story has enough promise that even a hired gun would have to try to fail. Heck, even Stephen King himself didn't fare so bad. It's how Kubrick perceives King's universe however, how he fills the frame with it, that renders THE SHINING a feast for the senses.Horror that will reach us through the mind and body alike, an assault as it were, tending eventually its pitch to a crescendo, yet curiously not without a delicate lull.Kubrick's cinema is, as usually, a sight to behold. We get the adventurous camera that prowls through the lavish corridors of the Overlook Hotel like it is some kind of mystic labyrinth rife for exploration, linear tracking shots exposing impeccably decorated interiors in symmetric grandeur. The geometrical approach in how Kubrick perceives space reminds me very much of Japanese directors of some 10 years before. In that what is depicted in the frame, the elements of narrative, is borderline inconsequential to how they all balance and harmonize together.Certain images stand out in this. The first shot of Jack's typewriter, ominously accompanied by the off-screen thumps of a ball, drums of doom that seem to emanate from the very walls or the typewriter itself, an instrument of doom in itself as is later shown. A red river flowing through the hotel's elevators in a poetry of slow motions. Jack hitting the door with the axe, the camera moving along with him, tracking the action as it happens, as though it's the camera piercing through the door and not the axe. The ultra fast zoom in the kid's face violently thrusting us inside his head before we see the two dead girls from his POV. And of course, the epochal bathroom scene.Much has been said of Jack Nicholson's obtrusive overacting. His mad is not entirely successful, because, well, he's Jack Nicholson. The guy looks half-mad anyway. Playing mad turns him into an exaggerated caricature of himself. Shelley Duvall on the other hand is one of the most inspired casting choices Kubrick ever made. Coming from a streak of fantastic performances for Robert Altman in the seventies (3 WOMEN, THIEVES LIKE US, NASHVILLE), she brings to her character the right amounts of swanlike fragility and emotional distress. A delicate, detached thing thrown in with the mad."
"3815","The Shining",4,"What a disappointment","I had heard so much about how brilliant this movie was. I finally watched it and I hated it.I give it 4 stars and not 1 because I thought it was filmed beautifully and the three leads gave great performances.But now here's what I didn't like.My main criticism is that this movie does not make sense. The story is incoherent and incomprehensible. There are visuals that look like symbolism, but are not related to anything. It looks like a movie that was supposed to be twice as long and was heavily cut, losing its meaning in the process. Maybe that's what happened?Another thing that annoyed me, especially in the first part of the movie, is the editing. Why so many dissolves? It was seriously making me dizzy. Also, the editing of all the dialogue scenes at the beginning, which are already very slow, got on my nerves. This unchanging alternance of reverse shots was making me crazy. In fact, I even wondered if all of this was a conscious choice to unsettle the viewer. But I was mainly annoyed.Last, but not least, this movie isn't scary! Why did I wait all these years to watch it, for fear of being traumatized? Sure there were very good jump scares. But making me jump is not the same as scaring me. Some of the ""scary"" visuals, as I already complained earlier, were so unrelated to anything that they made me laugh rather than scaring me. And I didn't feel any tension because nothing in the story made sense to me. It was all disjointed and weird."
"3816","The Shining",8,"One of the scariest movies ever---8/10","I was never a big fan of horror movies. They usually try cheap tricks to scare their audiences like loud noises and creepy children. They usually lack originality and contain overacting galore. The only horror movie i like was Stir of Echoes with Kevin Bacon. It was well-acted, and had a great story. But it has been joined and maybe even surpassed by Stanley Kubrick's The Shining, quite possibly the scariest movie ever.The movie follows a writer (Jack Nicholson) and his family who agree to watch over a hotel while it is closed for the winter. There were rumors of the place being haunted and the last resident went crazy and murdered his family. But Jack is convinced it will be OK and he can use the quiet to overcome his writer's block. After months of solitude and silence however, Jack becomes a grumpy and later violent. Is it cabin fever or is there something in the hotel that is driving him mad?One of the creepiest parts about the movie is the feeling of isolation that Kubrick makes. The hotel is very silent, and the rooms are huge, yet always empty. It is also eerily calm when Jack's son is riding his bike through the barren hallways. Jack Nicholson's performance is also one of his very best, scaring the hell out of me and making me sure to get out once in awhile. My favorite scene is when he is talking to a ghost from inside a walk-in refrigerator.The Shining is tops for horror movies in my opinion, beating the snot out of crap like the Ring and The Blair Witch Project. It may be a oldie, but is definitely a goodie. 8/10"
"3817","The Shining",9,"I hate horror, but I love this movie!","The Shining is a masterclass in film-making and a staple of popular culture. I, personally, cannot stand horror films. I don't like to feel scared, and I don't like to have my emotions manipulated by scary monsters, scary music, scary lighting, etc. I feel like horror is an easy genre - it's easy to scare some people, and people go to movies hoping to feel something, so why not fear?But, I had heard a lot about The Shining. I decided I would look up the plot and watch some clips so I wouldn't be caught off-guard by anything, and I could just appreciate the characters, directing, cinematography, etc. Despite knowing everything that would happen, the film was unbelievably engaging. I couldn't take my eyes off the screen. Jack Nicholson, of course, steals the show with one of the most iconic performances ever, and the other actors were decent, but the real star was Kubrick himself. Every shot, every set, the sound design, and everything has his fingerprints all over it, and it is such a delight to watch. When Jack advances up the stairs demanding the bat from Shelley Duval, I grinned from ear to ear because everything in that moment was just perfect in film.The movie, like all others, has problems. In my opinion, the Grady girls and the bloody elevator do not hold up. I knew they were coming from the summaries I had read, so I knew what to expect, so the only reason I could see them as being scary or unsettling is if the viewer was caught off-guard. If you're pretty feminist, you're not going to like Shelley Duval's character, as she is a pretty weak character.All in all, this film is fantastically-made, a cinematic and acting delight, and a gripping horror film that is considered a classic for a reason."
"3818","The Shining",10,"Appreciated More With Time","As each year goes by, people realize even more just how brilliant this movie is. The Shining unnerves the viewer in a way other horror movies can only try to; its surreal feeling, hidden messages and terrifying performances captivate you and leave you wondering long after the credits roll. Kubrick made a masterpiece, and analyses of this work of art are continuing to find more and more deeper meanings.ANY horror fan, and really any fan of cinema, must see this gem."
"3819","The Shining",5,"What to say....","Don't get me wrong, the originality of the story is great, mainly because it was done before all of those abandoned but ""haunted"" hotels, motels, houses, whatever kind of building scenario. But I thought the movie moved at a time dragging pace, the whole shot of Danny Torrence rolling around on his tricycle left me wondering...""What was the director thinking?"" A lot of the things that happened in the movie made no sense to me really. The book I thought was much more clear and less abstract on the transformation of Jack Torrence. I also thought the betrayal of Jack Torrence's character was wrong. We essentially knew nothing about him or his family, other than Danny was having bad dreams, then it starts with the Torrence's taking over of the hotel for the winter and Jack has lost his mind.I loved how it was done in the book, you got a good feel for who Jack was and where he had come from and you felt good about him. When they go to the hotel the symptoms Jack experienced where eye widening. He was chewing on the aspirin, losing his temper and getting major headaches, all conclusive to when he was drinking, but he wasn't. I thought the movie missed a little on that. The movie by itself however seemed to want to breath a life of it's own rather than paying homage to the novel it came from. I guess when it came down to it, I really had no care for the wife and child. Danny walking around saying redrum was really one of the most annoying things I have ever had to watch. But because the film was so slow to progress that when the climax finally showed up it failed to make up for lost time and attention.All in all, an O.K. movie, but I really don't see what the hype was all about in the this other than the famous ""Here's JOHNNY!"" line. Watch it if you wish, obviously it has a 8.5 on IMDb for a reason..."
"3820","The Shining",10,"Here's Johnny!........how horror should be","Horror films are associated with extreme and sickening violence/gore, lunatic killers and mostly focus on teenagers. They are mostly just poor excuses to put extreme violence on film to appeal to younger people, and nearly all, with a few exceptions such as Saw, are totally crap. Violence doesn't make a film good. In making The Shining, Stanley Kubrick has shown the world how horror films should be made.There are none of the predictable bad-guy-jumps-out-of-the-dark scenes to try and scare you. Instead Kubrick builds up suspense with the chilling musical score, and Jack Torrance gradually gets driven insane. Jack Nicholson is perfect to portray the character of Torrance. Not only is he a brilliant actor anyway, but he looks perfect for the part. He isn't your stereotyped perfect-looks actor, I don't think someone like Brad Pitt would be as effective playing his part. Pitt is a great actor, but you can't imagine someone like him going insane in a weird hotel! I think the cast is important to this film. Kubrick cast a proper leading actor and actress, rather than the randomly assembled casts of young 20 year olds you get in most horror films. And hey! The result is way better.There are a perfect amount of genuine horror scenes, such as the famous axe scene, and the scene in the maze, and it never goes over the top. There is also some unique horror scenes, such as when Jack writes about 1,000 pages of the same words, and the visions of the blood from the elevator and the little girls. They are bizarre but very effective in building suspense.The storyline is also much more effective than the usual story of teenagers being pursued by a lunatic murderer. A man stuck in a hotel for the winter with just his family who gradually goes insane is much more original and much much much more effective. Horror films are meant to be scary, and this really is. There are many scenes showing Jack's willingness to give in to temptation, and how he wants to get away from his wife and weird son. The camera-work is also excellent, as it builds up tension by moving along the corridors, and it also emphasises that Jack is feeling confined in the hotel.Stephen King didn't like Kubrick's interpretation of his novel, I can't believe how. Kubrick just made it better! This is a top film and is a landmark for horror films."
"3821","The Shining",8,"It's a Classic","I'm a huge Stephen King fan, first and foremost. I've been reading his books for most of my life now, and I have very fond memories of the time I spent reading most of his books.
Except The Shining. The Shining, although far from being one of his longer works, was so full of unnecessary fluff that I had an extremely difficult time getting through it at all.Kubrick took the novel's best points, added some of his own trademark storytelling flare and made a product that, while vastly different than the book, is a product that still very much satisfies horror fans around the world. And, as a Stephen King fan, I wholeheartedly approve of the changes that Kubrick made to the work.This film, unlike its novel, is a true psychological thriller. It's an examination into the gradual mental deterioration of an individual stuck in an isolated area with only his wife and kid to keep him company... or so it appears at first glance.
There was a lot of tension behind the scenes, particularly between Shelley Duvall (Wendy Torrence) and Stanley Kubrick, but every bit of hard work and anguish that went into the project wielded one of horror's all-time greatest films that will be watched, enjoyed and studied years into the future.
And, in true Kubrick style, there are always some questions left unanswered. It's not for the purpose of setting up a sequel; it's done because i truly believe Stanley wanted his audiences to be thinking all the time. This movie is a major success in that department as well."
"3822","The Shining",10,"one of the very few movies that scared me","When i first went to watch The Shining I was expecting a decent film from what I had heard about it and I liked a lot of Stanley Kubrick's other work but when I started to watch it it was so much better than I thought it would be.At times I seriously felt ridiculously uneasy and I couldn't take my eyes of the screen still there's something very disturbing about everything in the film. Now some people don't like Kubrick's version of The Shining since it doesn't entirely follow Stephen King's book but in my opinion both Kubrick's version,the mini-series and the book are all great.Jack Nicholson gives an awesome performance.If you are looking for a good original movie that will keep you thinking even after the movies over then watch The Shining."
"3823","The Shining",3,"A Cold and Heartless Film","I'm firmly under the impression that people judge films purely on single scenes and iconic imagery rather than actual depth and storytelling. Case and point: this film.
The imagery is breathtaking. So many iconic scenes and images that leave a lasting impression on your mind. And this is what people remember.
But then, you start to think about the actual story. Jack Torrence's slow decent into madness was neither slow, surprising or influenced by his environment. And that's what really kills this movie. I can honestly say, if the Overlook was not haunted, this movie, as presented, would have had the exact same ending. It is really a look into an imbittered drunk who goes mad from cabin fever. Everything that goes on around him is irrelevant. Is that the point? If so, it is truely a wasted opportunity as now any adaptation that is made in the future will be judged against this and be panned for telling an actual story. There is a reason Stephen King hates this movie, because it has no soul."
"3824","The Shining",NA,"One of the Scariest Movies Of All Time!!!","This is the classic horror!  Stanley Kubrick's Finest!  The scariest of the ""Kubrick Stares"" has to be Jack Nicholson looking through the door in the classic horror scene.  The camera, music, acting, and scares are top notch! I highly recommend this movie to: Horror fans, Kubrick fans, psychological thriller fans, and even Nicholson fans.  You will love this movie to death! Four out of four stars.  A definative classic!   SEE IT!"
"3825","The Shining",6,"A major disappointment.","This has got to be the most overrated movie in the history of film. I just watched it for the first time, expecting the best of the best, and it was quite a letdown. The sets and music are great, of course, but Kubrick seems to have forgotten one very important thing: to make a horror movie horrifying, you have to have likable characters. That way, when bad things start happening, the audience feels for them.What we have here, however, is a documentary on the most dysfunctional family in the world. Isn't this supposed to be about a loving husband and father who goes insane? Jack Nicholson is brilliant at portraying total insanity, but there's no gradual shift into at all. He looks like he's about to snap from scene one. His wife is a whimpering, nervous wreck who does not seem to trust him at any point throughout the movie. And the kid, Danny, is just a weird little nut. Who can identify with these people?Another major problem is that there is no clear storyline here. The whole first half of the movie is about the kid's psychic abilities, and then it does a total switch and focuses on Jack Nicholson being crazy. What was the point of spending all that time on Danny? It seems like it is foreshadowing something, but it never amounts to anything. I guess Danny is the first one to see ghosts in the house, but that is not a big enough plot point to spend the entire first half of the movie on.Other than some incredibly creepy music and sets, there is nothing really scary in this movie. It is fun to see Jack Nicholson ham it up, of course, but there is no scariness involved when you spend the entire movie waiting listlessly for him to pick up an ax, rather than being shocked when he goes from lovable to psychotic. Instead, he goes from obviously-wanting-to-release-a-ton-of-built-up-aggression to psychotic, which is extremely inferior.6/10 stars, and that is being generous."
"3826","The Shining",9,"One of The Best Horror Films Ever","I was kinda surprised when I heard that Stanly Kubrick had made a horror film and that it was The Shinning was a big shock to me. Kubrick is one of my favorite film makers and after I saw 2001 and Clockwork Orange I had to see his other movies. I had heard a lot about this movie and kinda a lot of the scenes but I really didn't remember this movie that well. So I rent the movie and watch it as soon as I got home and loved it. This is one of my favorite movies even though I really do not like the horror movies. Jack Nicholson give his best performance(have not seen One Flow Over The Cuckoo's Nest).Sherry Duvall and Danny Loyd do better good but I didn't like their performances. The thing I didn't like about this movie is that the shinning in the story is wear the Danny can do a lot of telepathic things with his head, which I thought was kinda random. Even though that the things I didn't like about this movie really bug me I still love this movie. This is a great movie if like to see another Stanley Kubrick film or just want to watch the one of the best horror films out there."
"3827","The Shining",7,"All play and no work makes Jack (Nicholson) a VERY dull boy. . .","It's certainly not a new complaint in relation to this film, but I must register it anyway: Jack Nicholson's acting here is all wrong for the material. Instead of a slow buildup from banality to insanity - which, given the movie's otherwise brilliant creepiness of tone and style - could have been truly horrific to watch, we get Jack Torrance as the nutjob Big Bad Wolf right from the very beginning. It's weird: it's as if Kubrick is indeed making the ultimate horror film, and Nicholson is sabotaging it every step of the way by enacting the ultimate horror film *parody*. Each on its own terms is immensely enjoyable, but they effectively cancel each other out. I've never seen the styles of director and star diverge so emphatically (A minor comparison would be the first ""Fletch"" movie, where Michael Ritchie's taut direction is appropriate to a gritty crime thriller, but where star Chevy Chase waltzes through the vehicle glibly throwing darts into every dramatic setup).However, there's no point in blaming Nicholson for the mess - this was clearly the way Kubrick wanted the part to be played. Perfectionist and control freak that he was, you don't believe for a minute that any inch of a Kubrick film isn't exactly how he wanted it; he certainly wouldn't allow a mere *actor* to steamroll his well-laid plans, not even one as forceful and magnetic as Jack Nicholson. Still, this movie - together with Batman, and even One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest - soured me on Jack for a long time; I found in him an actor far too willing to coast on his personality and to ham it up mercilessly, rather than bother to actually create a recognizable human being. Such a technique is fine, even commendable, for farceurs like Jim Carrey or Paul Reubens (either one of which would probably have been just as effective as Nicholson is here at being Jack Torrance) but we should expect more from our so-called Dramatic Actors. It wasn't until I saw some of his more restrained, nuanced work in such films as Ironweed, Wolf, The King of Marvin's Gardens, and even (amazingly) Easy Rider that I realized what a truly fine performer Nicholson can be when he is forced to, as it were, paint in between the lines (by the way, no complaints from me about his Oscar for As Good As It Gets - he's the only actor alive who could have made that part work the way it did). It's just too bad Kubrick didn't decide to use him this way; watching Jack Torrance go from a diffident, restrained man (watch the first part of Wolf to see how surprisingly well Nicholson can play such a character) to a rampaging lunatic would have been truly frightening (even with the extra bit of campiness Nicholson throws in - ""Heeere's Johnny!"", etc). It would have been as if the Overlook Hotel unleashed some primordial demon from the depths of an essentially decent man. The way it plays now, Jack's evil and insanity are loudly telegraphed from the very beginning (those dancing eyebrows of his NEVER stop!) - all that's left is to go through the motions.Of course, there are some pretty startling motions to go through in this movie; Kubrick's technical brilliance and his ability to create an engrossing mise en scene ensure that the film can never be seen as a total failure. In fact, when Nicholson is offscreen, the goosebump factor here is actually pretty high. The long tracking shots of Danny riding his Big Wheel through the winding hotel corridors are justly famous, as is the very design of the Overlook's wide open - yet paradoxically oppressive - map room (where Jack does his ""writing""): these sequences effectively make the Overlook into a character itself. The isolation of it, its stillness and quiet, and most importantly its labyrinthian hugeness serve to overwhelm the tiny family and break down whatever bond they may have (which, again, would have been so much more effective if we felt this family was ever bonded in the first place). Kubrick ingeniously avoids shock devices, for the most part, and creates his spooky atmosphere through an almost inhuman stillness and quiet - which effectively creates an undertow of dread and expectation in the viewer. Quite simply, there are images and flash-cuts in this movie that will get under your skin and that you will never be able to shake - they will haunt your subconscience forever (deliciously). None more so than the truly classic moment where Wendy, the wife, finally discovers what it is Jack has been ""writing"" all this time: I can think of few movie moments in history that are so gut-bustingly hilarious and at one and the same time so bone-chillingly frightening and perverse. For this one moment alone, the film demands a viewing.It's simply too bad that Kubrick felt the need to invade the sanctity of his gothic cathedral like setting with the over the top rantings and ravings of the town lunatic. Not that that lunatic is not one devil of a fun guy to hiss and laugh at, it's just that he belongs in a different movie - the Evil Dead flicks, maybe, or one of Freddy Krueger's opuses. This conflict in styles between star and director ultimately make The Shining, for me at least, a frustrating experience: I keep wishing one of them would just get out of the other's way. The Shining could have been one of the hammiest and most enjoyable grand guignol horror experiences ever, or it could have been perhaps the most finely crafted and subtly shaded psychological thriller of all time. Alas, it cannot be both - and in trying to do so, it effectively undermines itself at every turn."
"3828","The Shining",10,"Whether you want black comedy or horror, Kubrick delivers it all with this one.","... This isn't the first time Stanley blurred the distinction between genres to such great effect, either. In Dr. Strangelove you had a comedy about a horrific situation, and here the basis is a terrifying scenario which actually yields some very funny moments. Slow-burning madness and attempting to kill one's family isn't hilarious of course, but the dialogue is very knowing (""five months of peace is just what I want... "") and there is a terrific drinking scene which would be riotous if you included just one type of spirit, but is spine-chilling when you factor in the other.I disagree with those who say that the hotel has a negligible effect on Jack Torrance in the filmed version. The cues Nicholson provides the audience as an actor merely hint at the potential for madness, which is only reinforced when we learn that the head of the family has struggled with alcoholism and is emotionally distant from his wife and son. The environment that he is in, however, then absorbs those personality defects and unleashes them upon his consciousness. In much the same way as buildings are sometimes thought to soak up events that happen there, the hotel feeds on the frailties of a troubled but sane man, and uses his weaknesses against him to eventually take him beyond the point of no return. He may have dormant flaws in his personality before he arrives, but to me the Overlook itself is the trigger that sets them off.Kubrick's cold and detached approach to directing works splendidly for a chilly horror film, and the unpredictable force of nature that is Jack Nicholson teeters all the time between making you giggle and scaring the wits out of you. When he explodes, you won't be sure how far he can go. Together they made a great team and with a blend of their talents gave us a classic. If you want a great viewing experience, then this is an example that well and truly shines..."
"3829","The Shining",10,"Horrid Movie","Stephen King is one of the greatest American novelists in the past century. While he is dubbed a ""horror writer,"" he is much more than that. He is a character writer, and while his novels are intended to scare, characters are the central point of the novels. They rely so heavily on backstory that the characters are practically real. However, this is very hard to do on film and it can result in making the story seem unimportant. So, as you can expect, I was not eager to see how they could ruin The Shining. Well, after reading the spectacular novel, I moved onto the film. After watching the film, I was flaming mad. The film The Shining does not fail from their overuse of backstory. These characters are completely shallow and you don't care about them. King novels are hard to adapt, but they can be done well. Carrie is an example of that. However, this movie is an awful adaptation. Kubrick basically took some character names, some locations, and made his own ""scary hotel"" movie. Why he couldn't just make his own ""scary hotel"" movie, I don't know. The acting is, for the most part, garbage. Shelley Duvall gives one of the worst performances I've ever seen. She's just so awful that you want her to get killed, as opposed to the novel. I just felt that I didn't care about anybody in this film. It felt empty and like there was no point to anything in the end. King said that he doesn't like the film because it doesn't make you feel. I agree completely with that. I felt nothing other than lack of interest when I watched this stinker. It wasn't even passable as a good stand-alone film. I hated every minute of this film. It was supposedly psychological horror, but it didn't make me think at all. This movie is horrible, and I hope book readers never have to witness an adaptation as bad as this atrocity...well, okay, there is the '97 TV movie, but even that's not as bad as this crap!"
"3830","The Shining",1,"Absolutely awful, awful stuff","This entire movie could have been viewed with subtitles and everything on fast forward. Low on dialogue and storytelling, and sky-high on Kubrik-Hype, his God-awful long shots were as deadly as Jack Nicholson's axe... they killed the movie and any suspense it attempted to create.I literally watched the last part of this movie on fast forward. The Kubrik-esquire long shots are an absolute drag, and the producers should have worked more on the script to let people understand the story more.Try watching a few scenes on fast forward, and you'll get the joke. Absolutely unacceptable. The story is not served in any way by watching a well-acted freak with an axe limp across a half-mile hallway or an old black guy walk, 6-inch stride by 6-inch stride across the same bloody hallway for five minutes.All movie adaptations worthy to be mentioned should have enough material within the contents of the movie for people who have NOT read the book to understand ENOUGH so as to get the general story right. This adaptation does not do anything of the sort. Unacceptable script-writing and unacceptable direction. I forgave Kubrik on 2001: A Space Odyssey, but after watching The Shining, in hindsight, his clichéd long shots and his awful storytelling puts him in one of the directors whose work I consistently do not enjoy."
"3831","The Shining",2,"This is no horror","Was this supposed to be scary
was I missing something
cause it was dead and dull
and what was up with Danny lloyed and his second personality it has no use in the movie the shinning was never really explained or used and the mother Shelley Duvall wasn't that bad but I found myself looking and staring at her teeth through out the entire film
as for the build up of Jack Nicholson's Jack torrance you really don't notice anything like the build on insanity until the last 30 min or so and even then your like who the hell cares you just want the movie to end I also noticed a few problems near the end like when the mother is the bathroom after sending her child out through the window she stays there for a good couple of mins before going to look for her son but then goes up stairs like why would he be there she also tends to run so pathetically i was laughing every time
I can see why Stephen King hated this movie this is not scary at all it's a slow stupid drama that never lives up to the hype I can't believe I wasted my time watching this but then again I have been fooled before"

I would definitely recommend you watch this movie...but first watch the original classic from 1972 ""The Godfather"" . The movie may not be as good as the first movie but is still an amazing sequel."
"3833","The Godfather: Part II",10,"To call it a sequel is a travesty","This movie is way to be good to be labelled a sequel to The Godfather .

"3834","The Godfather: Part II",10,"The Greatest Film Ever Made","The original Godfather is a brilliant work. It is in a sense a voyeuristic delight, allowing us to see the mafia from the inside - we become part of the family. It single-handedly change the world's view of organized crime, and created a cast of sympathetic characters, none of whom have a shred of common morality. It was the highest grossing movie of its time and Brando created a cultural icon whose influence resonates as strong today as it did in 1972.As extraordinary an achievement as this is, Part II is even better. It easily receives my nod as the best picture ever made. I have seen it at least 20 times, and each time its 200 minutes fly by.The movie uses flashbacks to brilliantly weave two tales. The main story is the reign of Michael Corleone as the world's most powerful criminal. Now reaping the benefits of legalized gambling in Las Vegas, Michael is an evident billionaire with an iron fist on a world of treachery.
Behind this, Director Francis Ford Coppola spins the tale of the rise of Michael's father, Vito, to the center of the New York mafia. It is these scenes that make the film a work of art. Without spoiling, I will simply say the Robert DeNiro as the young Vito is the best acting performance of all time, a role  for which he won a richly deserved Oscar.The screenplay is full of delicious little underworld nuggets (""Keep your friends close ....."", ""I don't want to kill everyone, just my enemies""), while it blows a dense, twisted plot past you at a dizzying and merciless pace. The cinematography is depressing and atmospheric. The score continues in the eerie role of its predecessor, foretelling death and evil.All of this makes the movie great and infinitely watchable. But it's what's deeper inside this film ... what it is really about ... that is its true genius.The Godfather Part II is not really a movie about the mafia, it is a movie about a man's life long struggle. Michael controls a vast empire that is constantly slipping out of his hands. He grows increasingly distrustful and paranoid, and even shows signs that he hates his own life. Michael almost seems to resent the fact that he is a natural born crime lord, a man who puts the family business ahead of everything.The great Don Michael Corleone can never come to terms with one simple fact.... his father's empire was built on love and respect, Michael's empire is built on fear and violent treachery.See this movie. It's three-and-a-half hours very well spent."
"3835","The Godfather: Part II",10,"Great ensemble acting, great story, greatest sequel ever made.","The Godfather Part 2 is the finest sequel ever made and is arguably a finer film than the original Godfather. The film is divided into two main parts - the story of a young Vito Corleone (flawlessly acted by Robert De Niro and a worthy Oscar winner) and the rise to power of Michael as the head of the family. Francis Coppola recollaborated with many of the crew members of the first film and again achieves a quite superb period piece thanks to the cinematography of Gordon Willis and set design of Dean Tavoularis. The acting performances are outstanding, hence three supporting oscar nominations for acting guru Lee Strasberg (Hyman Roth), Michael Gazzo (Frank Pentangeli) and Robert De Niro (young Vito Corleone). Duvall, Keaton, Cazale and Shire all provided first rate performances but it is the performance of Al Pacino which steals the show, expertly portraying Michael as a cool, calculating, suspicious Don Corleone. The film expands upon the original movie and brings us into the family's activities in Nevada, Florida and Havana. Arguably the finest movie of the 70s, a cinematic masterpiece with the greatest ensemble acting you will probably see."

"3839","The Godfather: Part II",10,"An Insult To Call It A Sequel","To me and probably to many other people The Godfather Part II is more of a continuation than sequel to The Godfather. Just look at the IMDb rating and you'll see I'm not the only one who feels this way. To me it as good as the first.The acting may have been better than the acting in the original. Robert De Niro gave a perfect subtle performance as Vito Corleone. His portrayal was powerful and breathtaking. When I think De Niro I definitely do not think subtle and smooth but that is exactly what he was in here. It is definitely one of his top three performances in his career. The depth in his portrayal was able to justify the Vito Corleone that Marlon Brando portrayed in the first. Al Pacino gave a very strong performance playing Michael Corleone. In here we get to see more of the tough decisions that have to be made and the consequences of certain actions. Al Pacino perfectly displayed the amount of thought and struggle that goes into and comes out of every action you make; the way it affects relationships, family, power and influence. Diane Keaton was not really given a lot of room to act in the first but in here she is very good. She did not play the stereotypical wife who always stands behind her husband but rather the woman with a mind of her own who is willing to go after what she feels she deserves. Robert Duvall again to me was the glue to the movie. Just having him in there kind of makes you feel safe. John Cazale also had more of an impact in here than in the first playing the half-witted brother always needing to be bailed out. A lot of these characters sound so familiar and stereotypical but in The Godfather Part II every character is played out with such extraordinary depth. Everyone from Talia Shire who gave a fine performance to Lee Strasberg all the way down to the kid who played young Vito Corleone were perfect. Part II seems to me to be more of a character study than the original.The directing once again is perfect. Francis Ford Coppola know or at least knew how to make a movie. The first to Godfather movie are done so precisely and perfectly that nothing really sticks out because they are so perfect throughout. Coppola just lets his actors play everything out as he should with type of cast he has here. Not to many movies can maintain such a consistent flow over 3 hours let alone even an hour and 45 minutes.The writing may not have been quite as good as the first in terms of quoting but the storyline was perfect. Seeing the decisions made by new mob boss Michael Corleone was common sense but flashing back on Vito Corleone's life was genius. The storyline to me could not have been better and Coppola and Puzo do a great job with it all the way.Like the first the cinematography was amazing but it had a slightly different tone to it. The first had more of a majestic, mythical look to it. In Part II you feel the modern times creeping in and the Corleones having to adjust to it. Part II has more of a corrupt and evil twist to it but I guess the end signifies that. The music obviously the same as the first was perfect and just fit so greatly with the rest of the movie.The first to movies of The Godfather series are really like the same movie. They are not the same though, they are actually very different but the greatness of them both and the continuation of the storyline from the first to the second really create a strong band between each other. To me it is only a sequel in that it was the second movie of a great series. No let downs, no disappointments just a continuation of of the greatness from the first one."
"3840","The Godfather: Part II",NA,"A Hollywood Masterpiece!!!!","Francis Coppola and Mario Puzo continue their epic saga into the lives of the infamous Corleone family, which is headed by Michael Corleone (Al Pacino).  It is a film which does better than its predessor, ""The Godfather"".  The film flip-flops graciously and beautifully between Michael's struggle over the family business and the life of young Vito Corleone (Robert De Niro, in a brilliant, Oscar-winning performance) in his rise to power as well.  Robert Duvall, Diane Keaton, Lee Strassberg, and John Cazale give excellent supporting performances.  Carmine Coppola's and Nino Rota's score is a masterpiece of music.  The movie is expertly filmed and the cinematography is superb."

The acting is just as fantastic, I can't believe Al Pacino lost the Oscar, and for once Robert De Niro was even better, he was truly amazing, and interestingly he fails to say a single word in English. The direction is also amazing, Francis Ford Coppola even does a better job than he did in The Godfather, and Apocalypse Now. The visual effects are so much better than the amazing one's in the original Godfather. One of the best films ever, a must see. Flawless."
"3842","The Godfather: Part II",9,"""Michael, I Never Wanted This For You.""","Nino Rota's musical score plays an even greater role in this equal but different successor than it did in the predecessor. Yearning, lamenting, stimulating bygone ages, see how infectiously Nino Rota's music affects our sentiments for the savage events on screen. It is the pulse of the films. One cannot imagine them without their Nino Rota music. Against all our realistic deduction, it guides us to how to feel about the films, and condition us to understand the characters within their own world. Throughout the Corleone family's many criminal actions, we understand that one doesn't have to be a monster in order to live with having done them.In what is both a dual expansion of its predecessor and a masterpiece of juxtaposition in itself, we see Michael Corleone forfeit his remaining shreds of morality and become an empty shell, insecure and merciless. As his father quietly knew in his latter days would be so, Michael has lost sight of those values that made Don Corleone better than he had to be and has become a new godfather every bit as evil as he has to be. The score, with its tonal harmony, its honeyed and emotional aesthetics, is sad, and music can often evoke emotion more surely and subtly than story. Consider several operas with ridiculous stories and lyrics yet contain arias that literally move us to tears.The devolution of Michael Corleone is adjacent with flashbacks to the youth and young manhood of his father, Vito, played with paternal, home-loving subtlety by Robert De Niro. These scenes, in Sicily and old New York at the turn of the century, follow the conventional pattern of a young man on the rise and show the Mafia code being burned into the Corleone blood. No false romanticism conceals the necessity of murder to do business. We don't look at Vito as a victim of his environment, but a product of the depiction of the resorts to which the Italian culture had turned, initially to both protect their homeland and protect their livelihood as immigrants who came to America to be paid less than the blacks.The film opens in 1901 Corleone, Sicily, at the funeral procession for young Vito's father, who had been killed by the local Mafia chieftain, Don Ciccio, over an insult. During the procession, Vito's older brother is also murdered because he swore to avenge his father. Vito's mother goes to Ciccio to beg for the life of young Vito. When he refuses, she sacrifices herself to allow Vito to escape. They scour the town for him, warning the sleeping townsfolk against harboring the boy. With the aid of a few of the townspeople, Vito finds his way by ship to Ellis Island, where an immigration agent, mishearing Vito's hometown of Corleone as his name, registers him as Vito Corleone. From this very opening, and the events that gradually follow, we see that Vito's damnable early experiences have enhanced his sense of family, and his experience of revenge as a necessity was passed on to Vito's sons.The life of young Vito helps to explain the forming of the adult Don Corleone. As his unplanned successor Michael, his youngest child, transforms, we hark back to why, when his true desire is to make the Corleone family completely legitimate, he feels that he must play the game by its old rules. His wife says, ""You once told me: 'In five years, the Corleone family will be completely legitimate.' That was seven years ago."" What we have are two all-too-real narratives, two superb lead performances and lasting images. There is even a parallel between two elderly dons: Revenge must be had.I admire the way Coppola and Puzo require us to think along with Michael as he feels out fragile deliberations involving Miami boss Hyman Roth, his older brother Fredo, and the death of Sonny in the previous film. Who is against him? Why? Michael drifts several explanations past several key players, misleading them all, or nearly. It's like a game of blindfolded chess. He has to envision the moves without seeing them. Coppola shows Michael breaking under the burden. We recall that he was a war hero, a successful college student, forging an honest life. Ultimately Michael has no one by whom to swear but his aging mother. Michael's desolation in that scene of dialogue informs the film's closing shot.So this six-time Oscar-winning three-and-a-half-hour gangster epic is ultimately a dreary experience, a mourning for what could've been. It is a contrast with the earlier film, in which Don Corleone is seen defending old values against modern hungers. Young Vito was a murderer, too, as we more fully understand in the Sicily and New York scenes of Part II. But he was wise and diplomatic. Murder was personal. As Hyman Roth says, ""It had nothing to do with business."" The crucial difference between the father and son is that Vito is cognizant of and comprehending the needs, feelings, problems, and views of others, and Michael grows in the very opposite direction. Whereas the first movie was a taut ensemble piece, this second part is a more leisurely film that closely studies only these two characters, neither of whom share scenes with each other. Everyone else is periphery.It must be seen as a piece with the consummate mastership of The Godfather. When the characters in a film truly take on a simulated environmental existence for us, it becomes a film that everyone who cherishes movies to any extent should see at least once."

The bad news is that this should have easily been a 10, but overall, it is so sprawling and unfocused that I can't possibly give it more than a 9, which it only earns because the assets transcend what's basically a mess overall. Because it should have been a 10, and most other reviews will tell you about the positive points at length, I may pick on more things in my review than you would think I would for a 9, but rest assured that even with the flaws, The Godfather Part II is still essential viewing.Director/co-writer Francis Ford Coppola cleverly begins the film with parallels to The Godfather. We see Michael Corleone (Al Pacino) ""in the role"" of his father, Vito (Marlon Brando), from the first film, accepting prostrating guests while a party is going on outside. Like the first film, the party consumes a lot of time while we get to know some of the principal characters. Perhaps during this segment, perhaps a bit after, we realize that maybe the beginning wasn't so clever after all, because the structure of The Godfather Part II parallels The Godfather from a broad perspective, as if Coppola and co-writer Mario Puzo used the first film as something of a template to create this one.After the party is over, there is an attempted hit on Michael, and we quickly learn that not everything is rosy in the Corleone's mafia world. Michael believes that someone on the ""inside"" was involved with the hit. This launches a complicated sequence of events that has Michael, who is now living in Nevada, traveling to Miami, Cuba, New York, and so on. He accuses different people of involvement in the attempted hit depending on whom he is talking to. This may have all been part of a grand scheme to set up the responsible parties, but one of the flaws of the film is that Coppola doesn't convey Michael's underlying thoughts about this very well, not even later, and not through his actions. Rather than feeling like a clever set-up, it starts to feel like slightly muddled writing.During the middle section of the film, which goes on for hours, we also have a hint of a problem that plagued The Godfather--a bloated cast. There are bit too many characters who aren't well enough presented or explained. You may need to keep a scorecard.Coppola and Puzo also treat us to many extended ""flashback"" segments, and I mean way back, to Vito as a boy and young man, played by Robert De Niro. For my money, these were the best scenes of the film, although maybe that's a bit of my bias creeping in, as I'm a huge De Niro fan.But let's talk about the main plague of the film--sprawl. This is maybe first evident in the flashbacks. As good as they are, they go on far too long, and happen far too frequently, to sustain the momentum of either the Michael story or the Vito-as-a-youngster story. It begins to feel like we're toggling back and forth between two films, which is the track that should have been taken. The prequel, at least, would have been a solid 10.There's also a lot of sprawl in the Michael Corleone segments. Coppola appears to have been suffering from what I'd now call ""J.K. Rowling Syndrome"". That happens when an artist becomes successful enough that they can fire or ignore their editor(s). Instead of taking good advice about where to trim fat, the artist decides to just leave much of it in, and they now have the clout to override any dissenting and more sensible opinions. The Michael Corleone story has a lot of fat, including much of the Cuba material (for example, sitting around the table with the President, laboriously passing around a solid gold telephone), the Senate hearings (which go on far too long to make and provide the dramatic points), and so on.The film begins to feel more like a couple seasons of a television show that Coppola tried to cram into a 3 and a half hour film, or worse, a collection of deleted scenes. The scenes, except for the fat that needed to be trimmed, are excellent in isolation. But by the time the climax rolls around, the whole has more of an arbitrary feeling--this is especially clear in the dénouement, which seems to just end.I've barely left myself room to talk about the good points. The first one, which most people mention, is the acting. There isn't a bad performance in the film, but Pacino, De Niro, and some relatively minor characters, like those played by Diane Keaton, Talia Shire and John Cazale, really stand out.The second outstanding point, similar to the first film, is the beautiful visuals. Although all of the cinematography and production design is great, what really impressed me were some of the darkly lit scenes. Characters and features of sets emerge from pitch-blackness, and everything is rich, deep shades of burgundy, brown, and orange. Amazingly, nothing gets lost in these scenes. It must be incredibly difficult to achieve without making the shots too dark, because I can't remember another film since that has been able to capture the same look. The flashback scenes are also in similar, but lighter, colors, creating an appropriate sepia-tone feel.Although the broad perspective problems are unfortunate, a closer focus on most segments of the film provides exemplary artistry. Given that, and the film's importance culturally, The Godfather Part II is a must-see."
"3847","The Godfather: Part II",10,"Al Pacino all the way","I'm NOT an Al Pacino fan but this movie has the best performance of Al. I think no one in the history of world cinema has played a character better than Al Pacino in Godfather 2. He deserved an Oscar.
Godfather 2 is better than the first part. It is a great sequel, it expands the themes and the world of the first part. Robert De Niro is stunning as usual. Missed Marlon Brando. Best part of this movie is it shows the rise of Vito Corleone and Michael Corleone contrasting their times and personalities.
You need to watch Godfather 2"
"3848","The Godfather: Part II",10,"One of the greatest films ever made.","To say that this film is a sequel is a sin.
Al Pacino and Robert de Niro win the Oscar for this film, Robert de Niro's performance as Vito Corleone is perfect, every scene in which this one is perfect. Al Pacino as always perfect and unlike the first film, he is much better.PROS:EVERYTHING. The script, the direction, the cast, the performance, everything in this film is perfect and its 3 hours are worth it.CONS:NOTHING. This movie is perfect."
"3849","The Godfather: Part II",10,"Amazing Film","This is the greatest sequel ever made and in my opinion the finest film i have ever seen. I couldn't tell you how many time I have watched it."
"3850","The Godfather: Part II",10,"I really think this is the greatest movie ever made...","Wow. This thing is almost three and a half hours long and yet it is not boring for a second. Not one moment. From the very first scenes up until the tragic and forlorn ending, this film seizes hold of the viewer's consciousness and does not ever loosen its grip, even when the credits roll. I walked away from the movie with what felt like a deep resonance inside me. It is at once heart-wrenchingly sad and stunningly beautiful.Thematically, it actually shares much in common with later films such as American Beauty and Fight Club. The Godfather Part 2 is the story of a man who seems to have it all - but the only things he ends up not having are the only things that truly matter to him. Michael's character arc continues on from the first film, creating a great, epic tragedy and what I think is one of the saddest and yet most majestic endings in film.I haven't even talked about the more technical aspects yet. This is because I don't have to - everything is perfect. Not just great, but perfect, as in there seems to be no way that they could be improved on. Acting, direction, cinematography, script and story. Everything.The one thing, though, that clinches it for me is that the plot doesn't really matter. This is a movie about themes and ideas. The plot is quite thick, so don't worry if you don't get it - you don't have to. As long as you understand what the film is really about... you will walk away knowing that you have witnessed something almost life-changing."

"3852","The Godfather: Part II",10,"A Potpourri of Vestiges Review: The Godfather of all sequels","The Godfather Part II is a consummation of the saga of the Corleone Crime family. Regarded by many as the best sequel ever, the Godfather Part II is equally brilliant as its precursor and good enough to stand on its own. The movie juxtaposes, the early life of Vito Corleone (from his orphaned childhood to his rise in power in New York), with the life of his son, Michael (after Vito's death to Michael becoming the most powerful Mafia head). Al Pacino picks up from where he left in the first part, consummating Michael's journey to the dark side and in the process, presenting him as the greatest anti-hero, the western cinema ever embodied. The movie gave Pacino his third consecutive Oscar nomination and a perpetual stardom that catapulted him above the ruck, laying the foundations of his illustrious career. Just like in part I, his performance in this movie is absolutely worthy of an Oscar, but the Academy once again robbed him of the glory.Robert De Niro in his Oscar winning portrayal of Vito Corleone, gives a great performance without uttering a single word in English. The synergy imparted by the brilliance of these two outstanding performers, makes the movie, a treat to watch. Robert Duvall reprises his role of Tom Hagen with a desired degree of subtlety and equanimity, reminding the viewer of Brando's portrayal in Godfather part I. The entire cast is brilliant with special mention of John Cazole as Fredo, Lee Strasberg as Hyman Roth and Michael V.Gazzo as Frankie Pentageli, who are outstanding, to say the least. Cuppola's brilliant and innovative direction gives Puzo's masterful story, an incredible impetus, which is well complemented by Nino Rota's poignant score and Gordon Willis' vivid cinematography. In a nutshell, the movie, though sanguinary and lengthy than its precursor, is an equally brilliant work of cinema, a profound and a deeply engrossing master piece.http://www.apotpourriofvestiges.com/"
"3853","The Godfather: Part II",10,"pure excellence","I will just write a short review of this because all of the points were said on the reviews on this but I have always marveled at how great all the actors were in this film, Al Pacino had that certain charm,gentleness and yet ruthlessness in him in carrying out all the things he had to do, John Cazale as Fredo is a perfect role, sad that man died with so much acting left in him., Duvall, Talia Shire, De Niro and Diane Keaton also played their part perfectly and with so much ease...Overall, a perfect film that teaches you about everything."
"3854","The Godfather: Part II",10,"Superior sequel!","After realizing I have just reviewed the first movie, I realized I should do the 2nd!Out of Coppola's work that I have seen thus far, this is my favorite. This is quite ironic because upon my 1st viewing, I thought it was the weakest of the trilogy.It may seem insane to rate this above the first, but Richard Roeper calls this his favorite movie.(See IMDB's trivia page for him.)Now WHY do I like this above the other? Hmmm..I have a hard time explaining that. I think one thing is the quotes. ""My offer to you is this...nothing."" ""My Dad said you would always catch a fish if you said a Hail Mary.""(that's a paraphrase.)
If I had to criticize something, it would be its length. Roger Ebert said ""no good movie is too long and no bad movie is too short."" I disagree with the first half.TGP2 is very good but it's also very long. At 202 minutes, the movie actually seem longer and I had to repeatedly stop the DVD to get through it. Luckily there is an intermission you can skip.Either way, I do think this is the best Coppola film and therefore-if you see the 1st movie before this, you will definitely thoroughly enjoy it!"
"3855","The Godfather: Part II",10,"BEST MAFIA MOVIE OF ALL_TIME PERIOD!!!!!!","This movie is one of the Greatest Mafia Movies of all-time in my view! The depiction of a Mafia Family was really the focus of this movie! Deniro, Pacino, and Brando clearly killed this movie! I mean the scene where they took you back to the old country and showed how the first God father became the Boss of all Bosses was stellar! This movie can be watched over and over again! I've been watching this movie for over 25 plus years! Clearly a great classic!!!!!!!"
"3856","The Godfather: Part II",10,"Amazing!","A masterpiece! The perfect sequel. My favorite out of the series."
"3857","Birds of Prey",NA,"A Disgraceful DC Chick Flick.","To simply put it without wasting anybody's time unlike my time was wasted watching this garbage, Birds of Prey And ....etc is a chance completely wasted! should've been, Harley Quinn (add any lame title here), There's No Notable presence of Birds of Prey here. The film is How Harley Quinn stood against a gay version of Black Mask.The plot story and the directing is a true to heart chick flick and clearly influenced by the feminist movement. The script emphasizing blindly on discriminating against men by representing all male characters in either gay, bisexual portrait or an evil and traitorous manner! The female on the other hand are represented is sadly based on race not on the relation to the comics character nor the fans desire, which is clearly a method of trying to tastelessly involve everyone that no race feels left out! I.e., the choosing of an Asian Cassandra Cain over Barbra Gordon.The disaster starts from the casting process, I'll never stop believing that Margot Robbie is a very bad depiction of Harley Quinn, From the looks which is feels way off, as Margot has a long face while Harley has a round face to the fact that she does not feel or sound the same, least to say how different Arleen Sorkin says Mr. J or Puddin' with a nerdy yet playful way and how Margot fails to represent that. Not to mention the ridiculous child size mallet they gave her in this movie. I believe the main reason why many fans drool over Margot in the first place is mainly because they didn't see anyone else play the role on a big screen yet not because Margot is a good actress or can represent Harley well. The scenes decorations feels like it was designed by a crazed extravagant fashion designer and the fighting scenes along with the directing is obviously all over the place in a disastrous manner.My suggestion is don't waste your time or money on this garbage until the suits learn how to make a proper Harley movie."
"3858","Birds of Prey",4,"Boring and forgettable","While Margot Robbie is a good Harley Quinn, the character was not given enough arc. The plot was predictable and mainstream, especially due to lack of a strong antagonist. The main antagonist, played by Ewan McGregor, was not developed and hence did not add significant value to the plot story. Although some of the fight scenes were entertaining, the film as a whole was truly forgettable."
"3859","Birds of Prey",2,"If you love comics, this is a horrible portrayal of ""Birds of Prey""","Margot Robbie is pretty awesome as Harley Quinn however even with that, this movie is one step up from unwatchable. The plot is all over the place, the dialogue is horrible, the characters other than Harley Quinn are inconsequential, and basically the producers are just spitting in the eye of anybody who has been a fan of the comics. There were a couple good laughs and a couple good fight scenes but otherwise this really was nothing but a loud, garish Suicide Squad spin-off. I'd be all for a real DC Birds of Prey movie, but this film should not even have had that name in the title."
"3860","Birds of Prey",1,"First Hit: This movie was absolutely horrible and a waste of time and money.","First Hit: This movie was absolutely horrible and a waste of time and money.The original title of this film is ""Birds of Prey: And the Fantabulous Emancipation of One Harley Quinn."" The title alone is a warning enough, and when you read it, it is all you'll need to know about this story. I do not know what the screenwriter or director was thinking, but it wasn't about making a movie that had conscious cognizant coherence.From the get-go, this film is a mess. Using narrative and disjointed clips of film, to attempt to put the story in place and time was useless here because there really is no place or time.I thought ""Suicide Squad"" was a quirky fun movie and where we meet Harley Quinn (Margot Robbie) for the first time. She was odd, ""out there,"" and on the edge of crazy. This film Birds of Prey is supposed to give us the backstory of Ms. Quinn. It is also a way to introduce other characters, the ""Birds of Prey,"" consisting of Renee Montoya (Rosie Perez), ""The Huntress,"" aka Helena Bertinelli (Mary Elizabeth Winstead), and ""Black Canary,"" aka Dinah Lance (Jurnee Smollett-Bell).There's little character development, so they use some narration and snippets of past stories to fill in the backstory of these characters.This group of women come together because of and over the improbability of a young pickpocketing girl, Cassandra Cain (Ella Jay Basco), swallowing a large, I mean colossally large diamond stolen from a thieving, conniving, and self-named lord of Gotham, Roman Sionis (Ewan McGregor).Lots of fighting ensues, and we always know who wins. The fighting scenes are not well-choreographed and felt staged. The logic stream of the story was virtually non-existent while it seemed as though the director Cathy Yan threw together a bunch of clips of film scraps she shot with this cast doing stuff and called it a day.Robbie is an excellent actress. She' has proven her abilities in many films. Therefore, I'm surprised she co-produced and acted in this hot mess. Despite her talents, this was not good work. Perez, who has been missed in recent years, did what she could with this limiting role. Winstead was the best of the lot. Her quiet demeanor and her story of how she came up with ""The Huntress"" was amusing when everyone else liked calling her ""Crossbow."" Smollett-Bell tried to make her character mean something but, again, the script and direction let her down. McGregor was okay as the foil for the Birds of Prey. Christina Hodson created a disjointed and lackluster screenplay with little substance. Yan has no business directing a film with this film as proof.Overall: This movie was a total waste of time."
"3861","Birds of Prey",1,"Wannabe Deadpool without the laughs","Target demographic (12-17 year old girls)Movies rating (R18+)Whoever thought this was a good idea definitely needs to reconsider.

"3862","Birds of Prey",1,"Worst experience of my life","Well i highly suggest that you do not smoke before starting that movie.
I did and i was trapped on my couch without the will to move my arm to reach the remote control. So i was literally forced to watch the whole movie!

"3863","Birds of Prey",1,"What a piece of mess!","Saw this movie with no expectations and open minded, And oh my word what a complete disaster! This movie was a pain to watch, boring, nothing happening, stupid dialogue and a script that's just not interesting at all! I honestly didn't think that a movie that was so hyped could get so ruined in so many ways, some elements were kinda cool but not enough to clean up the mess the rest of the movie served.Without a doubt one of the worst movies i have ever watched (possibly the worst ever). A total waste of money in my opinion."
"3864","Birds of Prey",4,"Entertaining, but an overbearing theme(men are bad) becomes boring","This could have been such a good movie! The movie took a few steps too many into the woke space.

"3865","Birds of Prey",3,"A real disappointment... Incoherent & muddled","A dud from Warner Bros. The best thing about suicide squad was Robbie's performance but this vehicle is a disservice to the potential that was there.

Well, here's a 1/10 review from someone who has.Margot Robbie as Harley Quinn reminds me a lot of Lori Petty in Tank Girl (1995), another comic book film that really ground my gears. Like Petty's character, every quirky mannerism and snarky comment by Harley got right on my tits, as did her horrible fashion sense. In addition to Robbie's diabolical performance, we get equally obnoxious turns from Rosie Perez as a tough cop, Ella Jay Basco as an annoying pick-pocket, and Ewan McGregor as camp crime boss Roman Sionis, plus an absolutely pointless tribute to Marilyn Monroe, lots of dumb, supposedly amusing captions, a tiresome self-aware voice-over, and a horrible CGI hyena.Director Cathy Yan (who?), working from a charmless script by Christina Hodson, is unable to do anything interesting with the admittedly wafer-thin plot, which can be boiled down to just a handful of words: ""everyone is looking for a diamond"".A muddled, noisy, gaudy mess, full of poorly constructed action scenes and goofy humour that falls flat on its face, Birds of Prey is possibly the worst film I have seen at the cinema in recent months. And I saw Cats and Bombshell (another Margot Robbie disaster)."
"3869","Birds of Prey",1,"How did this movie get made?","So many good actors and characters, how did this turn out so badly.
If it was free to watch, I would have turned it off.
Unfortunately, it's just bad."
"3870","Birds of Prey",5,"Entertaining at times, but is all over the place","Birds of Prey: and the Fantabulous Emancipation of one Harley Quinn, is a movie I had high hopes for but it fell flat. I will start off this review with the positive aspects first such as: Margot Robbie as Harley Quinn was a great casting and continues to be where I think she gives a better performance then her one in Suicide Squad, and Ewan Mcgregor plays a decent version of Black Mask. The use of colours and costumes I thought were great and I found some moments of entertainment through some of its action sequences.However, This film has a lot of problems, most of the performances in this film are very shoddy, especially from Rosie Perez who is a walking cliche' as Renee Montoya (and I know that's what they were going for but it just doesn't work}, and Mary Elizabeth Winstead as Huntress who gives us some very cringey at times acting, and I think some of this has something to do with the screenplay which I also think is average at best. The humour that they're going for doesn't work at all I chuckled maybe once, and it was the same for my theatre. They also butchered Victor Zsasz which I found extremely disappointing as I was looking forward to his inclusion in the DCEU, the way he was portrayed was nothing like how he is in the comics and it seems like he is just trying to be some knock off version of the Joker. Also why is the film titled Birds of Prey? This is a Harley Quinn Movie, just like the trailers the Birds of Prey are barely in it and when they were they had small glimpses of being cool characters but for the most part they were some of the most cliched early 2000's era superhero characters I have seen since that era.Overall, I found Birds of Prey to be a disappointment I came into this film very optimistic but got let down, due to the fact that this films writing was just plain bad. If Margot Robbie's and Ewan Mcgregor's performances weren't as great as what they were with the nice compliments of the characters costumes it would have been completely boring and cliched garbage."
"3871","Birds of Prey",1,"So so bad","I love Margot Robbie & like the Harley Quinn character in Suicide Squad so really wanted to enjoy this but it was just abysmal, the whole way through I was just waiting for it to get interesting or just have some remnant of a point but it sadly never appeared. Don't waste your time."
"3872","Birds of Prey",3,"Bad writing is apparently the norm now","Rambling incoherent story line drags down all other aspects of the movie to the point where its not worth watching.

"3873","Birds of Prey",2,"Could be the Worst Sequel Ever","I was one of the many fans of Margot Robbie who was wowed by her initial performance as Harley Quinn and looked with anticipation for the character's return. I never imagined the pathetic sequel that has been released. EVERYTHING IS TERRIBLE! The Director and the Scriptwriter who created this stink bomb should be banished from Hollywood and Margot should have held out for a better script instead of accepting her payday. Very disappointing."
"3874","Birds of Prey",1,"Wanted to like it, but such a disappointment.","The acting was good, most of the actors gave it their all, but the film was just so UGLY. Gave me a headache just looking at it. Also the dialogue was so cringe worthy. It wanted to sound and look edgy, but ended up being a complete mess of a film. Feel sorry for a character with such a strong fan base."
"3875","Birds of Prey",1,"Not the Birds of Prey","Suggestion, when doing a comic book film using beloved characters make sure to land those characters. You can deconstruct them all you like, but if the heart isn't there you get this instead of ""the joker"".There is no Birds of prey, at least none recognizable from their source material counterparts. Robbie is not Harley, her 90's trashy grunge gender studies cousin maybe, but not Harley. When a cartoon does better than a multi-million dollar film, you've failed.Over the top man hating new wave feminism and alphabet ""representation"" for no reason. Action is not believable. Writing is atrocious. Editing is frenetic.If you hated Suicide squad, welcome to its jealous over achieving sister."
"3876","Birds of Prey",3,"Movie completely disrespects the source","It's trying to be a Deadpool movie but it failed Miserably. There are some good action sequences but overall they are nothing like the Birds of Prey. For being a comic book movie it definitely fails. It's a messy movie overall."
"3877","Birds of Prey",2,"Absolute steaming dung pile.","What an absolute waste of money w the stupidest script. Of all the talented writers that must be out there - why would you choose to produce an obviously idiotic story like this ?? I just don't get it.

"3878","Birds of Prey",1,"If you enjoy a man-hating, femsplaining, dumpster fires, then this movie is for you!","With badly driven character arcs and nonexistent plot, ""Birds of Prey"" is a directionless mess. Instead of showing you a fun and interesting story, they would rather talk you through expository dialogue and narration. Beneath this pile of wasted potential is a sadly missed opportunity for an interesting story about some of DC's most interesting characters. The most compelling part of the movie for me was Hunteress, who had less screen time than an adolescent pick-pocket. But the best part of the film isn't even about the film, but the critics response. Even the top critics, whose job it is to judge movies by their story and characters, say that the fighting was so cool that it makes it a good movie. So then, why isn't Green Lantern considered a good movie? Man of Steel? Suicide Squad? These ""critics"" are either to dumb to realize an awful movie when they see one, or they're afraid to criticize movies because of the backlash they might get.In conclusion: Don't make the same mistake I did and waste your hard earned money on this two hour long mood swing."
"3879","Birds of Prey",3,"Birds of disappointment","Some of the action scenes were okay. Nothing special I was really hoping to see something worth watching. This is quite a disappointment. A lot of hype as usual What can I say? I'm just hoping when Venom comes out. I'll have something to enjoy. I don't recommend of this one."
"3880","Birds of Prey",1,"Not worth the time, not worth the money.","I did not think the movie was worth the time it took to watch it. Harley, the main character, never shows any change from being a selfish despicable person. The only two ""good"" characters take a back seat and hardly show up until the end insted of getting sufficient screen time to make them memorable, and the way its written makes it as hard to follow as the story your 5 year old is trying to tell you. Overall, it had some scenes with good graphics but not enough to make up for the colossal waste this movie is."
"3881","Birds of Prey",8,"Solid entertainment","I had only the vaguest idea about what to expect going into this movie and maybe that's why I was able to relax and enjoy it. Because, if you do that, you're just liable to find it highly entertaining. The actors did a good job of giving the characters personalities and clear motives. There was a good amount of humor without going off the deep end into silliness. The great soundtrack added to the energy of the movie without overwhelming scenes. This is a thoroughly enjoyable movie."
"3882","Terminator: Dark Fate",5,"Why the Terminator series is done","I'll be honest, Dark Fate is more mediocre than unwatchable, probably the best Terminator since T2... yeah, I know, the bar is so low, it's like limbo dancing at this point. This feels similar to The Force Awakens: in itself a slick, decent movie, but I've already watched the much better original, so thanks but no thanks.Positives? Mackenzie Davis, for whom I've had a hopeless crush since seeing her as a cute NASA geek in The Martian (and then again in Blade Runner 2049), plays a relatable, compelling character, with an intriguing mix of power and vulnerability. There are also a couple of neat set-pieces, especially in the first half, before everything becomes over-the-top tiresome.Linda Hamilton and Arnold show up for fanservice. It's kind of nice to see them both back with significant roles but, as is typical of fanservice, it's like gorging on too much chocolate: tastes good at first, but then come nausea and a vague feeling of shame.My main point is, the Terminator series is now hopeless, as the last movies, especially Genisys, have poisoned the well. The continuity is a mess and keeps being rebooted, so everything is pointless: no development can feel meaningful. Show of hands: who would be particularly surprised if the next Terminator movie was once again about John Connor leading the Resistance in another alternate continuity? No one? Thought so.Also, the new villain being so talkative was possibly the single stupidest idea in the whole project. You know why Arnold in T1 and Robert Patrick in T2 were so terrifying? Because they shut up! They said very little and, the few times they spoke, it always felt like something they did out of pure necessity (probing for informations, setting up a trap) but was fundamentally alien to their nature.This Rev-9 tries to talk its antagonists out of fighting him! Can anyone picture the T-1000 reasoning with its targets? The great Robert Patrick studied and imitated the body language of birds of prey to look creepier and inhuman, and the new bad guy wants to chat. Give me a break.5/10"

More ""wokeness"" from the SJWs that have taken over Hollywood.Besides being a total rip-off Judgment Day the special effects are worse now.I think the next Terminator needs to be gay black T-5000 against an Asian Trans woman T-7800 and it should take place in Haiti for the inclusivity.Movies are just getting worse and worse, but audiences seem happy with the inferior films coming out. The newer generations just haven't seen enough quality films to know a dud. Imagine all you had to eat your whole life was rotten fruit, then you likely will love rotten fruit. But once you had a juicy fresh fruit any rotten fruit will be repugnant to your system.Most Hollywood films today are treated like comic books. Very clinical, but in the process they lost the organic human touch and realism.SKIP IT!"
"3886","Terminator: Dark Fate",5,"Disappointing follow up","I'm a huge Terminator fan, I re-watched both 1 & 2 before seeing this. Big mistake.I'm gutted to say that this film has none of what makes Terminator 2 one of the best films of all time. The writing is below par, plot uninteresting and emotional connection between the Terminator and John Connor, none of that either. James Cameron, what is this? Mind, I don't think he's been on form for a good few years now.What makes Terminator 2 an amazing film aside from the brilliant plot, amazing effects, great screen writing and superb acting is the emotional connection between the Terminator and John Connor. This is the life blood of that film and makes the viewer really believe that despite the hopeless future humanity is facing, if this Terminator can protect John then maybe mankind has a chance. The Terminator is a father figure to John and this is what connects the audience with the film so much. The heart wrenching ending cannot be forgotten. The fact that we forget the the Terminator isn't human because of how well the film builds the bond. This is what makes Terminator 2 so great, not the epic action sequences.So I'm sad to say this film has absolutely none of that. CGI, CGI and more CGI. Do away with the depth of character building, emotional connections and just add over the top action. It's a poor follow up and lacks everything of what made 1 & 2 great. The acting is decent, Davis, Hamilton and Schwarzenegger do a good job but they've got very little to work with here. This is what disappointed me the most. Why does it lack substance? This is James Cameron's epic creation and this is what he serves up along with Tim Miller? A total cash in if I've ever seen one. If not going to divulge into the plot anymore, there's no need as it can't even be mentioned in the same breath as the first two films.If this film was viewed as a generic action film at the cinema it'd still be mediocre. The fact that this is supposed to follow on from the brilliant Terminator 2 just makes it even more disappointing. This is James Cameron's judgment day.Do yourselves a favour and wait until it hits home release or if you are planning on seeing it, don't bother watching the first two beforehand, you'll be even more disappointed."
"3887","Terminator: Dark Fate",2,"Awful bland movie which does nothing new","Terminator: Dark Fate is the next tired attempt to revive the Terminator Franchise.In a nutshell, this is awful. The film is little more than a generic and tepid action film with the Terminator name slapped on it. For 200 million dollars, it looks incredibly cheap and very bland, with an overly lit brown/beige palette and locations that you've all seen before (more road chases, more factories).Mackenzie Davis is the standout and gives a really good performance as Grace, but the others are really below par. Even Linda Hamilton portrays Sarah Conner as some inept old women who is just really annoying. Her angst and negativity in T2 was always justified, but here the motivation are all so thin that it ends up just being a pale facsimile of what she did for Cameron. Arnie is 100% phoning it in here and his role in the film is almost comical in regard to his ""character's"" situation. The new girl....isn't even worth mentioning.The plot is just exactly the same old ""send a bad guy and a good guy back to kill/protect someone then go on a chase"". There's absolutely nothing new here at all, and almost every beat from the other films is re-hashed, only here they inject long boring sections where nothing happens. These parts are supposed to be ""dramatic"", but there's no depth or originality to the story or characters for those kind of moments to work without just being dull.The CGI is woeful too, and I'll not spoil anything, but it takes a very big dump on the first two films from the very start.Any attempt at a third Terminator film should have been made in 1996-98. The film should have been written and directed by James Cameron and should have been completely set in the blue tinted post-apocalyptic setting we saw glimpses of in the first two films.Alas, we will never see James Cameron's ""Terminator 3: Future War"" as not only has the lore been tainted, but the time for it has well and truly passed.Terminator: Dark Fate is not only a poor, poor attempt at a third ""canon"" entry in the franchise, but it is for me, the worst of the post-T2 movies.Yes, even Genisys."

I might actually prefer some of the others, as much as I disliked them at the time.Looking at it objectively, it's not an awful movie. But they built it up so much with the return of Cameron and saying it was a 'return to form' etc that I think the disappointment has hit twofold. It is a very, very average film.I'm conscious of some 'gender politics' attached to this movie, or how it's perceived. Please understand that I was fully okay with having three female leads. Terminator has been the tale of 'the mother of the future' all along after all. Let's be clear that it was just a fairly poor film, regardless of gender.There are still only two films as far as I'm concerned - T1 & T2. If you want the real follow up, get hold of copies of the comics 'T2: Cybernetic Dawn' and 'T2: Nuclear Twilight.' (Read them in that order). They wrapped up the story tidily and respectfully. This film achieved neither of those things."

"3892","Terminator: Dark Fate",2,"What a shame ):","I'm having a tough time understanding why they chose to basically rewrite the entire Terminator storyline instead making a new/separate series. I never paid much attention to people whining about too many female leads, because there have been a lot of fantastic series with female leads, my favorite being Resident Evil. However.. for maybe the first time I have to agree.
Another bad idea thing that seems to be in fashion is bring back actors from previous movies in the series, which is especially bad for this flick. You ruined Sarah Conners, and why oh why did Arnold ever agree to be apart of this?
Sigh.. Unfortunately I have to agree with all these bad reviews. The Terminator series has been deeply tarnished with this attempt of rewriting one of my childhood favorites."

It's rubbish, we never understand anything about where the character are in some action scene. No mood, we can't feel any danger or tension.Music:
It's a Joke in comparison of T2. Brad fiedel was a genius here it's just ok for a budget movie.Scenario: If you are a fan of the Franchise stay away from this. It's so stupid. Basically the same plot points of T2 but without the philosophical issues and emotional charge. James Cameron turned his back from his fans. If you are attached to the lore of the Franchise, forget everything. The t800 is a joke, really, like a real one.
I went there with an open mind but i have the bitter impression that i have seen a political movie. I'am not opposed to that if the movie is good ( i loved Joker and i strongly disagree with its political message). i mean T2 was about a really strong women in the first place, we all love Sarah Connor. But here it's just dumb and this, ultimately does not serve the political message because of the plot inconsistency.Acting:
Linda Hamilton is okay and it's the only thing that save the movie with makenzie ( even if her character is not well written)
Arnold just came to take his paycheck, his performance is hilarious.
Natalia Reyes is transparent.
The rev9, gabriel Luna have no charisma, he scares no one, he is ridiculous.
But i'am all going to forgive them, given the emptyness of the scenario and staging. It's really not their fault.this movie is an absolute middle finger to the fans.
T2 was a masterpiece, this, is unforgivable. This can't be the following of the franchise, because of the inconsistency and basic common sense. Two major charachter have nothing to do with the story now, since after a major plot point in dark fate, Terminator 1 becomes a story about a waitress who got stood up by her boyfriend and go out eat a pizza. Basically a bridget Jones movie.I was complaining with Salvation but it was a far better movie. I was hyped because of James Cameron, i feel betrayed.As far as i 'am concerned, this movie never existed."

If I were on the marketing team though, that's exactly what I'd say to get butts in the seats.This was just more anti-male propaganda. The new terminator is androgynous, and the rest of the movie is about ""girl power"" and how useless men are even though they make all the female leads manifestly masculine.The director said that ""it would scare closet misogynists."" I've never actually met a misogynist, but if I do, I'll tell him he's owed a scapegoat fee."
"3896","Terminator: Dark Fate",1,"All-female cast remake","I say remake because nothing in this movie is new. It is merely recycling past editions. So it is boring and pointless. Most of the movie is following women crossing Mexican border and has nothing to do with sci-fi. Thanks god they did not precipitate the movie into politics. Nevertheless, The all-female cast does not bring any added value, on the contrary. I should finish this review by saying how stupid it is to buy such expensive rights and then have no imagination how to make something new out of it. Fans would write a better script for sure."

Now instead of the image of young badass Sarah Connor I'll have the image of a grandma being propped as a badass by corporate feminism as if it works.And I won't even get into the rest of the cast, a laughable hipster new terminator and a couple of generic ""this is the kind of tomboys millenials like"" female leads that would never belong in an action movie if they didn't look like the most cliche feminists ever, the short haircut, the sense of undeserved entitlement and the whole nine yards.The franchise is ruined, the story, the actors involved...

No spoilers from me but do yourself a favour watch T1 and T2 then go watch this. I liked bits of the movie but as a Whole this will sink Tim Miller and make James Cameron look a complete ahole! Linda, Arnold and McKenzie were good with what they had which in honesty wasn't a lot. This is an honest review by a big Terminator fan. I wanted this movie to be good so badly.

It's that part of you that holds on to hope that people can be good, that there is hope for humanity. I knew the basics of it when I went to watch it: that it is about investigative reporters looking into a story of abuse in the catholic church. And it uncovered so much more than just that. Honestly, this movie should be seen by anyone who seeks the true face of the world. We don't live in a pink bubble of happiness. F*cked up things happen to people all the time; worst thing is when it happens to the innocent. The little ones who can't protect themselves. When they are robbed of their faith and their hope and their future. Sitting in the film theatre on the last row, I was brought to tears as in front of me a long list of places where victims spoke out was scrolling. I was both shocked and mad. I felt sorry that people can fail so miserably. ""Mike Rezendes: They knew and they let it happen! It could've been you, it could've been me, it could've been any of us."" Indeed. When we witness darkness and we shut up and we don't do anything about it, that's when we fail. A poet once wrote, ""You can join the millions talking in the dark. Or you can stand up and scream light, out into the night."" So choose to stand up. In your profession choose to eradicate the oblivion of evil. This movie is a masterpiece.

However, what makes this film is an absolutely genius screenplay that is acted to perfection. This script will rock your world. I am not Catholic. I didn't grow up in a deeply Catholic area, but this film still affected me greatly. Everyone should see this movie for that reason. That is something that you have to see for yourself. However, I'd like to focus a little more on the technical aspects. Beyond the fact that the subject matter is heavy and extremely important to American and world culture, this movie does everything else right. The acting is absolutely phenomenal. This is particularly true for Ruffalo and McAdams. I adore the subtlety with which they both act. It is brilliant. There isn't much more to say. This film is pure brilliance from its opening frame to its closing moment. For both cinematic and cultural reasons, this is a film that every person should see."
"3909","Spotlight",10,"Fantastic Movie Filled with Sadness","Going into the theater to see Spotlight, I had read the rave reviews and knew I was in for something special. This movie did not disappoint! Being from Boston, this movie really made me think about my life growing up, as a lot of ""what ifs"" came to mind. ""What if"" I went to church every Sunday...""what if"" I was gullible enough to have a priest lure me into his lair. Spotlight goes straight to the heart of this amazingly sad (and apparently never-ending) saga of the Catholic church and the amount of abuse priests have inflicted on hundreds of victims. The acting is all-around fantastic, from Mr. Keaton to some actors that I am not familiar with, which is an aspect of this fine movie that makes it so profound. Tense throughout, I was saddened to hear that this abuse is an epidemic and probably will never be stopped. The exclamation point was when a member of the audience stood up and told the rest of us ""...I am a survivor..."" WOW..."
"3910","Spotlight",10,"Super film","It won best film, deservedly so. This is a film that resonated with me long after I watched it. The complicated tale of the investigation of paedophile priests in Boston and the publication of it is told in riveting fashion by Tom Macarthy who does not waste a frame or a scene to anything less than the plot or character development. I never felt the running time or in any way disbelieved any of the actors in their portrayals.Keaton seems to be on a total roll at the moment and he is excellent as the head of Spotlight but the whole ensemble seemed to put in a real shift. This felt like a documentary at times and I could feel the audience around me leaning forward as each new revelation is uttered. Just brilliant."
"3911","Spotlight",9,"Catholic Church in the Spotlight.","Relevant, powerful and astonishing. Shocking, criminal and true. These are the only words to describe this film as it has literally put the 'spotlight' on the systematic cover-up by the Catholic Church of mass molestation and sexual assault acts performed by the priests in the Boston archdiocese that were trusted in the communities they represented. These 'men of God' preyed on the weak and vulnerable for years and the most powerful religious sect in the world did nothing but sweep it under the proverbial carpet. 'Spotlight's' dramatic importance has immediately drawn the attention of film lovers who crave a riveting production that dives deep into a very real circumstance that has impacted every corner of the globe.Tom McCarthy could not have been at the helm of a better film and what he has been able to achieve in terms of wrestling the attentions of the audience is worthy of the highest praise. McCarthy, along with Josh Singer have written a gritty story that pulls no punches and it isn't afraid to get right into the heart of the required subject. For 'Spotlight' to have been received by the critics as well as it has it had to stride unapologetically into this unbelievable and sordid affair. It needed to expose the sensitive and controversial information that some people may find confronting but in the context of this outstanding production, absolutely essential. It destroyed lives and revealed the blatant arrogance of this pious organisation.The all star cast jumps right out at you even before the opening scenes are shot up onto the screen. Based on true events, 'Spotlight' pushes all the right buttons from the beginning. As the name implies, 'Spotlight' refers to the investigative journalism team who report for the Boston Globe newspaper. They are thorough, relentless and will stop at nothing to expose headline stories that affect the everyday lives of normal American's. When the new editor, Marty Baron (Liev Schreiber), drops a potentially explosive story in the lap of Spotlight chief, Walter Robinson (Michael Keaton), about allegations of sexual abuse involving the Catholic Church, Robinson and his loyal crew go about uncovering one of the greatest criminal cover-ups in human history. The deeper their investigation goes the more sadistic and shocking the outcome becomes. Fingers are pointed, people are accused and the list of clergy involved becomes larger and larger. The whole situation ceases to become a Boston problem and grows to a worldwide exposure. Rachel McAdams and Mark Ruffalo are part of the investigative team as young committed journalists Sacha Pfeiffer and Mike Rezendes respectively. McAdams performance is award worthy and Ruffalo is fully engaged in a role that matches his talents. Michael Keaton has found his niche in Hollywood as a sort after mentor showcasing another strong performance as the tenacious and hard hitting Robinson. The real 'cherry' in the cast is the presence of the magnificent Stanley Tucci as Mitchell Garabedian who represents the victims in the whole saga. Tucci adds the class that takes 'Spotlight' to another level with an engrossingly accomplished performance.This is the best journalistic drama since 1976's 'All the President's Men'. Tom McCarthy has centred his narrative within the confines of the Boston Globe's newsroom as it should have been. 'Spotlight' doesn't shy away from the true nature of newspaper drama and the audience benefits from such an authentic setting. Top shelf acting from some of the very best young talent sparks the fire that captivates the viewer. Throw in some true icons in Keaton and Tucci and 'Spotlight' has the perfect balance. This film will be classified as the very best in its category and has set a benchmark in terms of confronting realism. Sit back and enjoy."
"3912","Spotlight",10,"I Remembered Why I love Movies","Throughout the year I watched many movies and by the middle of the year I was finding it hard to watch a movie. I really had to force my self. I thought my love for movies is dying and I'm more of a TV person now. I was wrong. This movie (and the big short) proved to me that it wasn't me, it was actually the movies I've seen this year.This movie has it's flaws for sure. But the acting, script, direction, design and pace of the movie adds a lot to an already strong and heart breaking story. I was on the edge of my seat and even after the movie ended I couldn't move for a while. A well made film that I recommend to any drama fan. It certainly helped me find my love for movies again.Even with it's flaws I give it a 9.5"
"3913","Spotlight",10,"One of the greatest horror films of all time","... because by the time the credits roll and you start to breathe normally again, you will suddenly realize that this was not a horror film as such, this was a re-enactment of events that actually happened, with real victims and real perpetrators and real well-meaning third parties covering up the whole thing as fast as the body count kept piling up.And then you will once again have difficulty catching your breath.As a film it is superb. McCarthy who did double duty as writer and director deserves acknowledgement. The cast is universally excellent. Ruffalo gives the performance of his career, Keaton is solid as a rock, and McAdams reaps overdue dividends from her decision to broaden her career into non-glamorous roles at a time when the only scripts they were sending her were for Diva parts. Smart lady.A reviewer is not supposed to interject personal feelings in a review but I will say without apology that I miss films like these -- films that speak for the injustice in society and offer solutions -- and wish there were more of them. It seems that when I was younger there was a lot more interest in doing the right thing merely because it was the right thing. This no longer seems to be the societal meme, and that troubles me.A must-see."
"3914","Spotlight",10,"All the Vatican's Men in Outstanding Investigative Journalism Film Revealing the Skeletons in the Boston Archdiocese's Closet","In ""All the President's Men"", young reporters Bob Woodward and Carl Bernstein uncovered a national political scandal when they, through their investigative journalism, revealed the White House under then President Richard Nixon was using campaign funding to finance dirty tricks of political enemies, nicknamed Watergate. In ""Spotlight"", a similar team of investigative reporters reveal a scandal of epic proportions which makes much of the Watergate scandal seem tame by comparison. They uncovered widespread sexual abuse of minors committed by priests of the Roman Catholic Church who, in turn, hid the crimes. Michael Rezendes (Mark Ruffalo), Walter V. Robinson (Michael Keaton), Sacha Pfeiffer (Rachel McAdams), Martin ""Marty"" Baron (Leiv Schreiber), Ben Bradlee Jr. (John Slattery), and Matt Carroll (Brian d'Arcy James) work for a group of investigative reporters within the Boston Globe called ""Spotlight"" who succeed in finding the skeletons in the Boston Diocese proverbial closet. For many years prior to the sexual abuse scandal, Spotlight had investigated and reported on many other ground-breaking stories.The story begins with a quick flash-back to 1976 when a priest is jailed for sexual abusing a minor. The film then cuts to 2001. Marty Baron (Schreiber), a Jewish Floridian, becomes the main editor for the Boston Globe. He meets the different editors and journalists, and learns of work by Spotlight. A Globe column reveals a lawyer, Mitchell Garabedian, claims Cardinal Law, then Archbishop of Boston, knew Father John Geoghan, a priest within Law's diocese, was sexually abusing children, and the bishop did not bring him to the attention of authorities. Baron urges the Spotlight team to investigate further to see whether the claim is true and an isolated incident, or if there is more to the story. The ""seed"" is similar to the break-in of the democratic headquarters at the Watergate Complex which eventually revealed the Nixon White House had been engaging in multiple plots against perceived political enemies.The Spotlight team is headed by Walter ""Robby"" Robinson (Keaton), a no-nonsense fair but tough reporter/editor. They agree to Baron's wishes and begin researching deeper to see if there is a larger story. Their first lead is the attorney mentioned in the article, Mitchell Garabedian (Stanley Tucci). Rezendes (Ruffalo) peruses Garabedian who acted as negotiator between the Boston Archdiocese and victims of Father Geoghan. The reporter wishes the attorney to reveal names of the victims, but at first Garabedian declines. Eventually, Garabedian agrees to contact victims, who are now much older, and ask them if they are willing to speak with Rezendes without revealing their names. Eventually, interviews are set up at the attorney's offices. The question then becomes whether there were other priests who engaged in similar criminal behavior against minors.On another front, other members of the team, including Sacha Pfeiffer (McAdams), begin discovering the unspeakable reality of other victims possibly at the hands of more priests, aside from Geoghan. Then a tip from a former rehabilitation counselor for priests informs the team that, based on statistics, there may be as many as 90 priests involved with sexual abuse of children in the Boston Area alone. The team then appropriates volumes of an American guide book of Roman Catholic priests, published once a year, which lists the whereabouts of every clergyman in the church in terms of dioceses and parishes. The investigators make a startling discovery. Certain names in the book over several years are listed as ""on leave due to illness"", ""on administrative leave"", or other designations of inactivity after only one to three years at a particular parish, leading the team to consider these may be priests who engaged in sexual misconduct with minors. If true, it would place blame not only on Cardinal Law as possibly covering up the church's indiscretions but the entire Roman Catholic Church, all the way to the Vatican.This is a stunning film about the power of a small group of urban reporters to uncover wrongdoing by one of the oldest and far-reaching institutions in the world: The Roman Catholic Church. In particular high marks for Mark Ruffalo as Michael Rezendes, Rachel McAdams as Sacha Pfeiffer, and Michael Keaton as Robbie Robinson. So much of the story parallels the Watergate Scandal of several decades earlier. As horrible as the actual victimization of minors by the priests, often boys because they were less likely to ""squeal"" because of the shame, the cover-up by Law was nearly as criminal. Instead of taking the priests to justice, as he should have done, he tried to cover it up by offering settlements to the families, often when the victims were minors. Law and probably other church officials moved the priests to other parishes where they engaged in similar behavior, thus allowing widespread sexual abuse to continue. It was eventually revealed that not only did these sexual predators victimize children in other parts of the country, it was happening internationally."

""Spotlight"" makes you want to go down to your local courthouse and search the public records for clues. Then, get on the phone, with a pen and a pad, and start asking some really tough questions. Honestly speaking, ""Spotlight"" is the best investigative news drama this century. Matter of fact, behind ""All the President's Men"" and maybe ""The Insider,"" it's among the best ever made.""Spotlight"" tells the true story of how the Boston Globe uncovered the massive scandal of child molestation and cover-up within the local Catholic Archdiocese, shaking the entire Catholic Church to its core.Where you must begin, with any praise for the film, is the audacious and fortifying script by Tom McCarthy and Josh Singer. The two create cinematic magic in their articulation of words, characters, and narrative storytelling. Each person feels authentic. Each scene feels rich and equally important as the last. And most of all, its the tightest, most satisfying film from beginning to end, seen this year. From minute one, you're hooked, up until the last second, where they decide the last words spoken should be, ""Spotlight"" is astonishingly crafted.I'm still in shock and awe that Tom McCarthy is the one who made this. This is a writer/director who I've appreciated but didn't have the ""love"" factor surrounding any of his films. Paired with an outstanding cast, co-writer Josh Singer, editor Tom McArdle, cinematographer Masanobu Takayanagi and composer Howard Shore, Tom McCarthy gets a chance to create his masterpiece<U+0085>and succeeds. He makes brilliant artistic choices, such as letting a Mark Ruffalo letter reading play over a 2-minute taxi car ride back to the newspaper. McCarthy's direction is one of the best directorial efforts from any filmmaker this year thus far.All the players performing are top-notch but walking away, best-in- show, is the performance of Academy Award nominee Mark Ruffalo. Ruffalo exhibits his best screen performance to date, and makes a stake in his claim for the Oscar this year. Weirdly reminiscent of Joaquin Phoenix's work in ""The Master,"" Ruffalo builds his 'Mike' from the feet up, giving him his own characteristics that I'm not sure McCarthy and Singer set out to do. His expressions in words, mannerisms, all encapsulate the magnitude of his work, bookended by an explosive scene that brought tears to my eyes. Think back to Emma Stone's acclaimed work in ""Birdman,"" and the scene that made everyone notice. I wanted to simply applaud.Michael Keaton and Rachel McAdams, who play ""Robbie"" and ""Sacha"" respectively, are attune with their characters and destinations. Each bring strong sensibilities and sensitivity to their roles that desperately call for them. Hotly worked into the story is Liev Schreiber as a newly appointed Editor, that in the little screen time he's given, makes a long-lasting impression. Stanley Tucci is also afforded the same opportunity, and gives one of the film's best monologues.If there's a film this year that feels like an Oscar-winner, ""Spotlight"" sure does make a compelling case. Dramatic, heart- pounding, and necessarily made. It's one of the most important films this year and probably THE BEST PICTURE OF THE YEAR. The Telluride tradition may continue."
"3916","Spotlight",10,"Wonderful drama about the importance of investigative journalism","Everything about this movie is outstanding -- the performances, the way the true events are handled, the cinematography. In this day of digital news, this movie makes us stand back and realize what we may lose in the way of investigative journalism as we slowly kill off print media.The lengths the directors go to to achieve a sense of authenticity is remarkable. We are there in Boston in 2001-2002. We get to know enough about each character to make him or her real, but not enough to create side dramas. The focus remains the child abuse scandal in the archdiocese in Boston. That reflects the conflict the characters face and deal with when events make them rethink the focus of their article.The movie is riveting, though we know the outcome."
"3917","Spotlight",9,"Burns slow, but riveting to the end","Garnered awards and horrifying subject matter put aside, take a look at the movie poster for ""Spotlight"". It's a still image of the principal cast hovered over a cluttered desk in a small room. It's not flashy, but still an incredibly effective piece of advertising. You know in an instant that this is a journalism movie; die-hards in rolled-up shirtsleeves working all hours to unearth a national scandal. I am an absolute sucker for this.The scandal herein is the systemic cover-up of pederasty within the Catholic Church. To that end (even though a lot of the dialogue in this movie is come-from-behind startling), one line in particular jumped out at me: ""They say it's just physical abuse but it's more than that, this was spiritual abuse. You know why I went along with everything? Because priests are supposed to be the good guys."" This isn't just a story about the crimes committed, but there's also sensitivity towards the victims themselves. I dunno, I just found that line deeply unnerving.But when all is said and done, this movie runs on the grueling nuts-and-bolts detective work of investigative journalism; a uniformly excellent cast, great writing and tension that continues to build.Amazing stuff.9/10"
"3918","Spotlight",7,"A fine film but not worthy of winning Best Picture","Going into 'Spotlight' I was aware that it was the front runner to win Best PIcture at the Academy Awards. After having seen it I can't really understand why. That's not to say it wasn't a good film, it simply didn't blow me away at all. It told a story, an admittedly fascinating and true story, in an informative way but it didn't do anything that great films do like inspire me, move me or leave me stunned with the powerful nature it was told with. Best Picture winners of the past, like 'Schindler's List', told true stories but also encompassed all three of those traits and plenty more. That was a film I will never forget, 'Spotlight' will probably be completely out of my mind by this time next week. Frankly, I was a little underwhelmed with the lack of emotion such a serious subject brought out in me. The film just didn't really seem to try to do that. It felt more like a documentary reenactment, simply with very fine actors, than anything else.My disagreement with it likely winning Best Picture aside, there are some very fine filmmaking skills on show here in all departments. Director Tom McCarthy, in only his fifth turn at directing, has been nominated for a Best Directing award. While I don't like the lack of emotion his storytelling brought out in me, he clearly had a vision to tell a story in a certain way, and he got it done. He tells it in a punchy fashion that never allows the audience to drift off. The Best Directing race this year is a tight one with four of the five all being widely in contention. I don't think McCarthy will get the win however, as his film doesn't have the ""X-Factor"" going for it that a lot of the others do. Having said that, any film that wins Best Picture has to get some real credit for its director, so don't completely rule him out if it does indeed win that.Mark Ruffalo and Rachel McAdams have also been nominated for Best Supporting Actor and Actress awards. I have trouble understanding how, to again be frank. Roles based on real life characters always get more attention than others but these two had absolutely nothing to work with in the script. They were almost never given a chance to shine in any scene. Because of this I don't believe either has a chance of winning their respective award. It wasn't a film designed to make actors look good. Having said that, the stand out performance for me was Michael Keaton. He almost won the Best Actor award last year and this year can't even get a nomination. Had his been considered a Supporting Role I'm sure he would have but it was probably considered in that ""in between"" state, which may have hurt him.There are a lot of true stories at this year's Acadmey Awards and I think 'Spotlight' is benefiting from being the most interesting story of them all. 'The Big Short' is another case of an interesting true story, however that was told in a very unique and clever way. Interestingly, that is the biggest competition 'Spotlight' will have when the winner is read out on the night. My fingers might just be crossed on the seeing the upset."
"3919","Spotlight",8,"Spotlight is the Best Film of 2015","""Spotlight"" is the best film of 2015 and I will be disappointed if it does not receive the Academy Award for Best Picture. As good as it is, it is just one step short of greatness. ""Spotlight"" depicts Boston Globe reporters investigating priest sex abuse of children. ""Spotlight"" focuses like a laser on what it is to be a journalist, to consider whether or not to cover a story, to select it, to research it, to uncover piece-by-piece, a full narrative, to publish it and to live with the consequences of publication. You don't learn about the reporter's personal lives except for what you see incidentally as they work at home. There is no romantic subplot; there are no trumped-up action scenes where a reporter punches a priest. There's actually one of those scenes, no doubt a self- conscious salute to classic newspaper films, where you see newspapers being run through one of those giant machines that rapidly prints, folds, and stacks hard copies. I've never seen a film in which I liked these actors more: Mark Ruffalo, Michael Keaton, Rachel McAdams, Live Schreiber, John Slattery, Brian D'Arcy James, Stanley Tucci, Billy Crudup, Len Cariou. Lesser known actors in minor roles are every bit as good. There is no Hollywood in these performances. There's no sexy costumes or makeup, no grandstanding for the Academy. The actors are dressed in the workaday attire of newspapermen and women. Much of the film takes place in a grubby shared office full of sloppy manila file folders or in cafes and working class neighborhoods where informants are interviewed. Each performer plays a cog in a giant wheel working to uncover evil. None of them knows about world-shaking scandal still to come, or Pulitzer Prizes. They are just, with a pair of tweezers, turning over one leaf and seeing what lies beneath and adding that to the information already gathered. Even though viewers already know how this story played out in real life, the audience gasps when a discovery is made; the audience fears that a rock will be thrown through a window; the audience fears that judicial complicity will keep the story hidden. I began crying half an hour into the film. I was crying at the end. I made audible ""Huh!"" noises at especially and outrageously ironic moments, as did others in the audience. We applauded at the film's conclusion. The film opens with a child in a police station, accompanied by his parents and a priest. A lawyer enters. Everyone speaks in hushed tones. ""I promise this will never happen again."" The police are cynical. The lawyer is smooth. The child is crushed. The parents are heartbroken. The priest appears slickly demonic. The scene is anonymous. Events like this were repeated at least a thousand times. July, 2001. The Boston Globe acquires its first Jewish editor, Martin Baron. The Spotlight team is considering following up a case of priestly sex abuse. Slowly but surely, they discover that there are far more incidences than suspected. They discover not just one bad apple here and there. Rather, Cardinal Law has reassigned abusive priests to new parishes. Baron meets with Law. Law presents Baron with a copy of the Catechism of the Catholic Church. ""Spotlight"" mentions ""Good Germans""  people who kept their eyes closed to the disappearance of their Jewish neighbors, and the sudden appearance of ash falling from the sky. Just so, there were many ""Good Bostonians."" It's sickening to confront the many who had awareness of priestly sex abuse and did nothing. Targeted kids were powerless and without allies. One had a schizophrenic mother. Some had absentee fathers. Some were gay. Many were from the wrong side of the tracks. After they were abused, some became alcoholics, drug addicts, or suicides. When SNAP activist Phil Saviano is invited to the Boston Globe's office, and he talks about a conspiracy to protect abusive priests that stretches all the way to the Vatican, he comes across as a twitchy, obnoxious, conspiracy theorist raving about Area 51  someone easy to write off. The most nauseating reason of all given for ignoring clergy sex abuse: money. The Globe could have covered clergy sex abuse earlier, but it didn't. Over fifty percent of the paper's subscribers are Catholics. Boston is a small town, with a lot of insular Irish Catholics who don't want anyone rocking the boat, or risking various money streams, including the church's significant charity work. Especially poignant are the scenes where abuse survivors are encouraged to detail what happened to them. ""It's not enough to say he molested you. You must give me the clinical details of exactly what happened,"" reporters insist, to sobbing survivors, who must then re- inhabit their worst memories. The plot churns forward with the single line of a freight train running on schedule. I was never bored. The priestly sex abuse crisis is not a tragedy because the Catholic Church is corrupt. The priestly sex abuse crisis is a tragedy because the Catholic Church is great. The film could have become better than it is had it included this theme. Show Catholics feeding the homeless. Show Catholics recovering from grief with the support of their faith. Show Cardinal Law for what he once was  a courageous hero in the Civil Rights movement, when that meant receiving death threats and alienating the powerful. That something so beautiful is so sullied, along with individual victims' pain, is the heart of this tragedy. I am a lifelong, church-going Catholic. I present my reasons for being Catholic, in spite of everything, in my book ""Save Send Delete."" I salute, not boycott, the Globe's reporting, and films like this. Confession and redemption are gifts we shared with the world."
"3920","Spotlight",7,"A good docu-drama but nothing more","I liked this film, thought it was a well done solid film. But I am afraid I can't say anything more than that, it is very documentary like which can be it's biggest strength (a very fact driven plot heavy film) or it's biggest weakness (characters feel cold and distant and other than the plot nothing really impresses, also quite bland in the visuals department). However the characters do start to show some life nearing the end of the film but by that time damage is done it can be hard if not impossible for viewers to differentiate between the reporters for nearly one and a half hour of the film, they all suffer from different faces but same objective syndrome and inadequate effort is made to separate one from the another. Also speaking of run-time, this film is a wee bit over two hours long, editing especially in the first half could have made this film a bit crispier. However I did like the accuracy level in the film regarding the cellphones, ads, electronics and the cars used in 2001; a lot of films these days are becoming very careless in this regard. I would compare it to last year's Foxcatcher another fact driven docu-drama film, solidly acted, but nothing special in the direction, editing and cinematography department, I would still recommend it but no way this film deserves a second watch, you can absorb everything there is to get in a single viewing. All in all, a solid well written docu-drama which will have it's time in the ""spotlight"" (pun!) this Oscar season and will become ""oh that movie about pedo priests"" by next year's Oscar season."
"3921","Spotlight",9,"Faith","Greetings again from the darkness. Faith. A word that easily could have been the title of this gripping and heart-wrenching film. Faith can be defined as trust and belief. Faith can also be defined as religion and ideology. Few things are more devastating than broken faith <U+0085> the core of this ""based on actual events"" story of The Boston Globe's exposure of rampant child molestation by dozens of Catholic priests, and the systematic cover-up by ""The Church"".It's challenging to name a movie that is as well-made as this one, while also being as difficult to watch. We know the story <U+0085> we even know how it snow-balled globally <U+0085> but the raw emotions of disgust and sheer anger permeate much of our being as we watch it unfold on screen. Director Tom McCarthy (The Station Agent, The Visitor) co-wrote the script with Josh Singer (The Fifth Estate) and it's worthy of favorable comparison to other investigative newspaper films like The Insider (1999), Zodiac (2007), and even the granddaddy of them all <U+0085> All The President's Men (1976).The opening scene takes place in a 1976 Boston police station. A priest has been accused of molesting a child. Within a couple of minutes we witness the empty promises, the intimidation, and the cover up. So much is conveyed in this brief opener, not the least of which comes courtesy of the ambivalence of the veteran cop as he shrugs it off as 'just another day' in front of an idealistic rookie cop. This is accompanied by Howard Shore's spot-on score, with the best parts featuring only a piano and bass.Flash forward to 2001 as we meet the investigative journalist team called ""Spotlight"". It's led by editor Walter ""Robby"" Robinson (Michael Keaton) and his three reporters: Mike Rezendes (Mark Ruffalo), Sacha Pfieffer (Rachel McAdams), and Matt Carroll (Brian d'Arcy James). They report to Ben Bradlee Jr (John Slattery), whose father was the editor of The Washington Post during the Woodward/Bernstein/Watergate era. New to The Globe is managing editor Marty Baron (Liev Schreiber). Unlike the others, Mr. Baron is neither a Boston local nor a Catholic. In fact, we catch him reading Dan Shaughnessy's book ""The Curse of the Bambino"", just so he can get a better feel for the community and its people.What is most fascinating about the movie is that it focuses on the investigative aspects  just how diligent the reporters were in putting the story together  and how fluid the process was <U+0085> the story led them, not vice versa. There was no media agenda to ""get"" the church. Instead, the reporters experienced natural shock as each piece of the puzzle was discovered. One of their key sources was a priest-turned-psychologist (voiced by Richard Jenkins) who helped them put scope to the numbers. Another was Phil Saviano (Neal Huff), the leader of a victim's group, who had tried before to provide documentation to the press. Saviano is the perfect example of how someone so passionate about a cause can be viewed with such skepticism <U+0085> right up to the point when they are proved correct. Three attorneys add perspective to the cover-up. Eric Macleish (Billy Crudup) made a career of settling cases (and silencing victims) for the church. Mitchell Garabedian (Stanley Tucci) is the polar opposite  he fights vigorously to get the victims heard, while Jim Sullivan (Jamey Sheridan) is caught in the middle  settling cases for the church and struggling with his conscience. Other interesting characters include Paul Guilfoyle as Pete Conley, a smooth-talking power-broker for the church, and Len Cariou as Cardinal Law  the man at the top who eventually apologized and was rewarded with a high-ranking position at The Vatican.The film is so well crafted and acted that it features more than a few ""best scenes"". Sacha has a brief encounter with a former priest on his front door stoop. The priest freely admits to molesting kids and his rationalization will certainly deliver chills to most any viewer. Since this is Boston, it makes perfect sense for the reporters to be so distracted by the story, that it supersedes the Red Sox game they are attending at Fenway Park. Being that the investigation lasted well into 2001, it's quite informative to watch a news agency shift directions for the September 11 tragedy, and along with the nation, put all else on hold. Finally, there is a point in the movie where we as viewers have just about had our fill of extreme emotions  we either need to hit something or throw up  and reporter Rezendes comes through with exactly what is needed: an emotional outburst and release of exasperation rivaling anything previously seen on screen. It's a wonderful moment for Ruffalo as an actor, and a peak moment for viewers.The story hit the front page of The Boston Globe in January 2002. The paper won a Pulitzer Prize in 2003 for its superlative investigative journalism. The report vindicated so many who had been taken advantage of, and exposed the colossal arrogance of the church. The innocence of a child vs the power of God. The story broke the faith that so many once held, and started a global (as evidenced by the closing credits) reckoning and awakening that was desperately needed. The film offers a line of dialogue, ""It takes a village to raise a kid <U+0085> or abuse one."" In other words, it took the often silent actions of so many to allow this despicably evil horror to continue. In a tribute to the newspaper profession, it took a small group of dedicated reporters to pull back a curtain that should never again be shut. Let's have faith in that."
"3922","Spotlight",8,"Exceptional Movie About Reporters Reporting","The awards season may just have found its first forerunner. In a 2015 movie year that has been average at best without any standout films initiating awards conversation, Tom McCarthy's Spotlight rising above the heap to assert itself as one of 2015's best.With an all-star cast including Michael Keaton, Mark Ruffalo, Rachel McAdams, Live Schreiber, John Slattery, Stanley Tucci and Billy Crudup, Spotlight shines a light on a 2001 investigation by The Boston Globe's on the sexual abuse within the Catholic Church.Michael Keaton plays Walter Robinson who leads the Globe's investigative unit with Michael Rezendes (Ruffalo), Sacha (McAdams) and Matt Carrol (Brian d'Arcy James). Under a new editor Marty Baron (Schreiber), the team begins to unfold a horrific pattern of child sexual abuse by the church that was muted and covered up by high priced lawyers and payoffs to victim's families. As Walter probes further and further into the events (the setting is after the events the 9/11) the investigation reveals layers and layers of injustice of Catholic Priests that were aided by the highest powers of the church in an effort to keep the story muted.It all starts with a featured column about Catholic priest John Geoghan who was accused of abusing over 100 boys. A civil suit is filed but the details of the abuse were ordered sealed by the courts. Schrieber's Baron puts the team of reporters on the case and within days the evil that lurked with the sacred rooms of local churches begins to reveal is foul and despicable face.The investigation goes on for months as the team hits roadblock upon roadblock taking one step forward for every two steps back. But the story eventually breaks and the emotionally exhausted team is eventually able to bring to light one of the more depressing and important stories of the early new century.Michael Keaton was really good in last year's Birdman and named himself many awards and an Academy Award nomination for his part. In Spotlight, he may be even better. Under the direction of Tom McCarthy (Win Win, The Station Agent), Keaton shines and carries a performance of determination, frustration and redemption that is delivered with precision.Nods to All the President's Men will be inevitable. But that was a different era. A different movie. Spotlight is fresh and invigorating in its painfully frustrating subject matter. Audiences should leave with a renewed belief that investigative reporting is of monumental importance and that stories such as the one originating in 2001 Massachusetts are still out there clouded in red tape secrecy and muffled whispers. It is painful to watch at times. Trusted bonds between people, children, parents and the institution that promotes the opposite to what it sometimes preaches are disgusting revelations that are brought to the screen with sizzling effects.The entire cast from top to bottom is perfectly cast. And McCarthy doesn't populate his frames with unnecessary spectacular visuals. Spotlight is instead very straight forward. Focused and driven.Spotlight will be nominated for Best Picture and Keaton should get a nod for Actor. Ruffalo may also sneak his way onto ballot sheets. But whether Spotlight wins any hardware is unimportant as long as we recognize the importance of films such as these. A few years ago I would guess that 99% of the population knew nothing about the Iran hostage rescue highlighted in Ben Affleck's Argo. Spotlight should have the same effect acting as a docudrama that is both highly entertaining and educational at the same time. It is both a very good film and an important one.http://theintestinalfortitude.com/"
"3923","Spotlight",9,"This is why modern civilization is based on freedom of press","""Spotlight"" is one of the best realistic and serious movies of recent years. I don't want to tell the story, as you will watch it soon or later, but I want to admire the movie and the content itself. Instead of falling into the stereotypical hero and anti-hero type of movies, the movie narrates the story with realistic characters, sensual REALISTIC emotions and incredibly depicts the integrity and handwork of the Boston Globe investigation team. The acting of Mark Ruffalo and Michael Keaton are great. Finally, the movie does not fall into the category of twisty blockbusters but a realistic movie about an important subject that anyone will admire."
"3924","Spotlight",9,"The Spotlight of films","In the past 5+ years, I've read articles about the decline of cinema and the great successes of Television. There's no denying that there have been some wonderful TV/web series in recent years, but I think a film like Spotlight is the refresh button that moviegoers have been looking for. The story is compelling, the acting is unnoticeable, and the script seems to flow the way a real conversation would. The writers and director of this film are the ""Spotlight"" of filmmaking, opening up a sensitive story that people acknowledged but probably couldn't imagine on screen, and they brought it to us in a way where I felt all the emotions of someone finding out the truth for the first time. I watched Spotlight at the Zürich Film Festival and after 2 hours, thought it ended too soon. The only negative thing I could think of was that those French & German subtitles were really getting in the way. Maybe next time, the director could remove those ;)"
"3925","Spotlight",7,"Solid Film Lacking Dramatic Punch","This was a solid drama elevated by superior acting from a top-notch cast but I left the theater somewhat underwhelmed. The movie lacked the sort of drama that makes you wonder how the story will end even when you know how the story will end. The main problem is that the Catholic Church just doesn't come across as a particularly forceful adversary. We're told that the Church is so powerful and has kept the abuse hidden for decades, but when a group of reporters actually goes digging they encounter some roadblocks but nothing that gives you the sense that the Church was something to be feared. While I didn't necessarily need Cardinal Law to dispatch some Opus Dei goons to discourage the reporters and the victims, the movie would have been more rewarding if they'd encountered much stronger resistance from the Church, public officials, and their own family and friends."
"3926","Spotlight",NA,"Good cast, well-acted, but....","As several other reviewers have stated here, Spotlight is a ""solid"" film. There is absolutely no fault with the actors, who all acquit themselves very well, and the movie itself never drags.However, there's really no character in the movie whom the audience can latch onto. It's a terrific ensemble, but the fault, I think, lies in trying to give everyone in the ensemble an equal part in the story. Without making it about one person (whether a reporter or a victim), the emotional impact falls very, very short.What the viewer is left with is a general notion of, ""It's shocking that went on for so long and the church kept covering it up,"" but zero emotional investment and reaction. Unless you have a personal identification with any of the elements in this story, I think you will remain similarly aloof in regards to this film."
"3927","Spotlight",10,"Understated rendition, maximum impact","Despite its imposing title, Spotlight is an understated movie with a methodical approach that slowly gains momentum. It clearly, confidently shows us how our most precious resource, our children, have been damaged by abuse from catholic priests. This abuse has been prevalent mostly in the United States, but it has occurred wherever there is catholicism, and the church has systematically turned a blind eye to the proceedings. Some children have been driven to suicide by this abuse.In 2001 The Boston Globe decided to investigate one priest said to be abusing a large number of children, and the ensuing investigation reveals a huge cover up, with the catholic church using its power to frighten away the globe, and lawyers refusing to reveal important knowledge, and most importantly, an ex priest who rehabilitates abused children refusing to speak to the press.The Globe realises that they are handling one of the most important stories in the history of the newspaper, and their pursuit becomes relentless, leading to a shattering conclusion.This film scooped best picture at the Oscars and it bears all the hallmarks of the ultimate winner: absolute honesty and integrity in its subject matter, a complicated story simply told and beautifully acted by its committed team of actors. Most of the Spotlight team were catholics by birth and clearly this aided the process, the same applied to the actors, with Ruffalo particularly impressive as a reporter of Portuguese stock. I also liked Stanley Tucci as a lawyer who had dealt with many of the abused children, who was at first reluctant to deal with the Globe, but is won over by their commitment to the story.Abuse of one kind or another is a daily story in the newspapers these days, when it happened on this scale in a church it is even more shocking. This film lays out the facts in the most humane way possible, and everyone involved deserves credit for this. This really is a film that surely must give some comfort to the families that suffered because of this wicked abuse.Mary Gumsley"
"3928","Spotlight",10,"A Gem to Rival ""All the President's Men""","I finally saw this film a few hours before tonight's Academy Awards broadcast. I had a feeling that it had the chops to win the big one. Many of my friends have been touting it. It takes a truly skilled director and screenwriter to entice an audience to watch something where they already know the result. We are made aware of the foothold of the Catholic Church in the city of Boston. When a new news director comes on board, he feeds the need for an investigation into priest misconduct to the Spotlight team, a group of hard core reporters who are unyielding in their persistent investigation of whatever story is there. The beauty of this film is that at no time is there a sense of sensationalism. Yes, the church tries to cut them off at the pass and uses sealed documents as a weapon, but time is the issue as much as anything visible. Strong performances abound, but the characters have weaknesses and at times become a bit emotional over their task. This plays out with subtlety and an almost you-are-there sense. Loved this."
"3929","Spotlight",6,"The Subject Matter Is Noble But The Execution Is Unsatisfying","Yet another film I've watched because it's a contender for the award ceremonies next year and you can see why . The Oscars have taken onboard movies with an indie feel over the last few years and with SPOTLIGHT we have a double whammy of a film based on true life events this time featuring The Boston Globe investigation in to child sex abuse and the resulting cover over decades in Boston , Get these prizes out now Or on second thoughts put them away for the time being because SPOTLIGHT is something of a disappointment . Not so much a disappointment a film that doesn't really do anything radical in its sub-genre. Investigative journalism movies all suffer from the same structural problems along these lines: Journalist A gets hold of a possible lead , gets pulled in to the editors office and is told ""We can't run this"" Journalist B gets another lead on the same story , gets pulled into the editors office and is told by the editor ""We can't run this"" Journalist A and B work behind the editors back on the story and cut through every red tape obstacle in their pathJournalist c gets another lead on the same story ... you can see where this is heading can't you ? One thing the film does do well is explain to a secular audience the type of metaphysical power a Catholic priest has over a congregation but apart from that the rest of the film is curiously uninvolving and distant and one wonders if the acclaim it is receiving might be down to the subject matter rather than its cinematic credentials As it stands SPOTLIGHT is yet another slightly unsatisfying film expected to win prestigious prizes . There's no doubt in my mind that the 2016 Oscars will be dominated by THE REVENANT . As with every year there's always a film at the ceremony that ends up close but no cigar where it gets several noms but no Oscar in any category . I think SPOTLIGHT or STEVE JOBS might have that dubious distinction next yearUpdate March 2016 . The academy got it wrong again"
"3930","Spotlight",5,"The reporter's point of view isn't that interesting","This is a movie about the sex abuse scandal by Catholic priests in Boston. It is a movie that should have been made properly since abstract headlines don't tell a lucid story. However, making it from the point of view of the Boston Globe journalists simply isn't that interesting. It should just have been one of the aspects of the movie but not the main one. More emphasis on the victims and families, some major perpetrators, high ranking clergy actually doing the cover up etc could have been shown. After all, the reporters are not the main players in this tragedy. A more complete picture like in ""And the Band Played On"" would have been better. Difficult to keep track of who all the lawyers and reporters are.The earnest actors are all people you want to see succeed in their quest. Mark Ruffalo and Rachel McAdams particularly exude journalistic integrity. Liev Schreiber looks different here. As far as awards there just isn't that much of an actual acting role for any of the lead actors.The wrong focus of the story makes a scandal difficult to follow and tedious."
"3931","Spotlight",6,"""Spotlight"" highlights an important issue in a film I wish I could have liked more.","""Spotlight"" Cast a Shadow on the Catholic ChurchWith an all-star cast and a compelling story, ""Spotlight"" delivers a blandly straightforward telling of the priest sex-abuse scandal and cover-up through the investigative story featured in the Boston Globe in the early 2000s. The city of Boston was torn apart by the scandal that had lasted for decades, and according the film, many people worked to shield the Church from the consequences of the scandal. Without the cover-up, the scandal would not have lasted so long. However well done and easy to follow the story was, it was predictable. Few revelations were made for me. Certainly, it is an important story to tell, and I am glad I saw the film. However, none of the characters lived up to the power of story itself and the actors adding little to its telling. This may be the case of too much story, too little screen time. The film attempted in a couple of cases to make the suffering of the survivors real, but it played like an episode of ""Law and Order: Special Victims Unit"" and not like a feature film. It was too small for such a lofty topic. In the film, they often mentioned that people died, but it seemed unreal. Examples of that were need to bring it home. The film covered too much time without making the connections for the audience. I really want to like this film more, but it fails as cinema in too many ways. It would have made a better Lifetime Channel Drama as it was written. Rating: Matinée""Spotlight"" is good but not great. After a while, Mark Ruffalo's (playing lead reporter Mike Rezendez) pained expression wears thin. Does he have any other look? Not much in this film. Stanley Tucci puts in a good turn as a lawyer working with the survivors, but the rest of the cast is pedestrian. Perhaps it was the writing, but the film and characters didn't greatly impact me despite the best intentions of the filmmakers and the tragedy of the true story. Peace, Tex Shelters"
"3932","Ad Astra",2,"This is NOT about space or sci-fi","Its basically a story of Brad Pitt having daddy and abandonment issues and issues with relationships in general, which happens to be set in space.If that's what floats your boat, go for it. I hated it."
"3933","Ad Astra",2,"It is truly dreadful","The plot is completely ludicrous nonsense. None of the characters were developed enough for me to care. Brad Pitt is so boring in it! The science is all completely wrong. Visually it looked decent in parts (I watched in Imax) but it's mind numbingly boring and so insulting I was ready to leave after 1 hour. My wife said we should stay till the end but that proved to be a mistake. There are countless things wrong with this movie. I honestly wouldn't waste your time"
"3934","Ad Astra",3,"Almost an insult to the genre","I'm a big fan of Sci-fi movies, when they actually make sense...
As visually impressive as it might be at times, Ad Astra tries to be a psychological drama set in space. Only that it fails as a psychological drama and it's almost an insult to the space Sci-fi genre.You clearly see a movie failing when a grandiose or highly abstract topic revolves around the personal stories of a character or two, it makes it feel ""cheap"" or sloppy (yes, I'm thinking Interstellar also). If you place the main story in any other setting, some details change but the main idea can be left untouched, so is this a Sci-fi movie? Is this a space movie? And if it's not, why is it wrapped up like one?As some reviews describe, the main story is unconvincing at best, with a very sloppy script. Decisions feel forced for the sake of suspense, the journey totally predictable, there is no depth in the character construction.
However the worse part, which I consider almost an insult to the genre, is the message that can be read between the lines: ""believe and do not question"". It's almost like a bored priest in the Vatican decided to sabotage a Sci-fi movie.
I gave this a bit of thought and I can't remember any other Sci-fi movie being as anti-Sci-fi as this one.It gets 3 stars for the visuals and Brad Pitt's effort, but it could have (should have) been so so so much better!"
"3935","Ad Astra",1,"Slow and stupid movie","If you have trouble sleeping, watch this movie. The slow and boring storyline will put you to sleep."
"3936","Ad Astra",1,"Insult to science.... Just a drama movie with space as backdrop","Movie was just a drama flick....with so many unnecessary plots.
OK!!!.... So its space drama but at least get some science behind it. You don't fly around space with shield in ur hand like super hero... Overall terrible!!!!"
"3937","Ad Astra",1,"Ad Asstrash","This movie was released 6 months too early. If it had waited then the world would have been in lockdown and it would've received the 'straight to tv' treatment it deserved.Brad Pitt in a Space movie? Could be interesting, right?
It's not -Well im sure it can't be THAT bad - I might as well try it...
Don't -I'd love to give a more thorough review, but having just endured this movie I'm struggling to think. It wasn't intellectual, engaging or fun. The boredom has killed my evening and possibly caused lasting damage. I must wipe the drool from the corner of my mouth and hope I'm recovered by morning.Save yourself: Find _anything_ else to watch.P.S. The 2 minutes of space monkeys were good."
"3938","Ad Astra",1,"Worst waist of time","Very rarely, I provide any feedback on movies, but must make an exception here. This is the worst, flaming, heap of garbage I've ever seen. How this dumpster fire of a movie even has 6.6 stars is beyond me... if I could give it a negative 10 stars I would.
I'm not going to recap this abomination, as it's already been done masterfully here, all I will say, is do yourself a favor and don't waste your time, otherwise... well, it's your time."
"3939","Ad Astra",6,"How the screenplay can ruin a movie","I went to see Ad Asta yesterday evening. After the superb images in Gravity or Interstellar, I was curious to see what 2019 brings.
I wasn't disappointed, the movie is very well shot, the Space images are well made, deep sky, the Planets, the Moon, really nice.However, I think the movie was ruined by its screenplay which lacks of coherence. The story is really weak and undeveloped. There are many fractures in the reality of space travelling,You almost have the feeling that the screenplay was written to have a support for the images, nothing more.So yeah, I give this movie a 6 and I'm sad to see how a possible epic movie is ruined by a weak screenplay."
"3940","Ad Astra",4,"Disappointing. Would strongly not recommend.","It's a very bad movie. I don't know why it is rated so high. Firstly, it's a space opera but the character development and exposition and is sub-par at best. The motivations and behaviors of the characters are absurd. Don't even get me started on the scientific explanations. It is a big budget movie. They could have hired someone to make legitimate explanations. It's just massively insulting that they didn't even try. Story is just not good.The visuals are beautiful and the VFX look good but honestly, they could be so much better. Looks like the director intentionally didn't want the movie to be about the visuals but rather about the characters. But the characters are uninteresting and not developed well. It's just disappointing. There is one action scene. A space fight on the moon in lunar buggies. Yet, even THAT, an space fight on lunar surface, is boring and very uninteresting."
"3941","Ad Astra",1,"Don't waste your time and money!","Visually, well done. Technology and cinematography have blended into creating art with limitless capabilities and beauty, however.......the producers must think their audience are imbociles that will swallow any garbage that is thrown at them as they unshamefully take your time money after they con you with the trailers and star power. Empty & shallow plot and storyline. Kindergarten level science and physics. Unbelievable scenarios. I was truly rooting for everyone to die and the earth to explode.
Did they not watch the final product or test screen?"
"3942","Ad Astra",2,"Ridiculously Boring..","Just finished watching the movie feel like one of the most boring movie of the year, I feel if someone is suffering from sleeplessness they should better watch this movie instead of take sleeping pills.Bad script, Bad direction and what a bad ending.This is one of the worst space movie of all time."
"3943","Ad Astra",8,"Not a movie for everyone, but a must-watch if you're up for a slow but powerful movie","Let me start off by saying that the movie's pacing is unusual (think of the pacing of Interstellar; constant progress), but unlike Interstellar, this movie's climax is not as strong- but that's not a bad thing.The whole movie is about how Brad Pitt is calm on the outside, but inside he is a storm of feelings. This can be a metaphor for space itself- always quiet, but is very complex inside.The end of the movie (without spoiling it) also works with that logic- there is no loud Inception horn, in fact, seemingly it's pretty relaxed, but you can still sense the tension and emotions going on.Now that's what I call ""show don't tell"""
"3944","Ad Astra",9,"This is not the annual sci-fi blockbuster you were looking for. Thankfully.","Disclaimer: Ad Astra is a masterful psychological drama disguised as a gorgeous sci-fi epic. This is not the next popcorn space adventure flick some were desperately waiting for. In fact, it is way more than that.Driven by some of the greatest acting Brad Pitt has ever produced, James Gray's most ambitious film to date is a total treat for the eyes. Here, cinematographer Hoyte Van Hoytema is reaching new heights of creativity in his artistic vision, which easily differentiates his present work from the likes of Interstellar (especially those scenes with Ruth Negga are spectacular). Special reference must be made to the beautifully generated special effects, which really make this movie a contender for the most realistic depiction of space (as Gray himself had in mind). Camera doesn't shy away from taking a closer look at its protagonist, using angles that elevate every aspect of his skillfuly understated performance. As the story moves deeper in space (and Roy plunges deeper into the hidden wounds of his psyche), Pitt's exceptionally well-executed facial expressions, eye movements and mannerisms reveal fragments of instability to an almost frightening extent, given how much of a calculated, calm and disciplined person the leading character seemed to be on the outside. You can virtually see Roy's deconstruction and recontruction throughout this epic journey into the abyss (of outer space and human soul).Questions are raised, and answers are not always easy to digest. A life devoted to achieving a ""greater"" professional/scientific (but not necessarily noble) goal can lead to alienation and eventually abstaining from life itself. And it's not like it's always a rewarding journey. It often just leaves behind severely traumatized souls, as Gray's depressive, introspective space drama depicts in the most touching way.If there are any negatives to be pointed out: Perhaps a little too many references to Apocalypse Now (at least I found them a bit distracting).p.s.: Many haters will desperately try to discredit this film. The easiest path is to rant about the screenplay and overly focus on supposed ""plot holes"", taking the plot at face value despite the movie's metaphorical approach. Sadly, they are missing the main themes along with every point it tries to make. It's actually very absurd, since most of the scepticists are obviously fans of Interstellar, whose ending is a plot hole the size of a... black hole! Don't let these hateful attacks distort the experience of this thrilling journey into the soul."
"3945","Ad Astra",2,"James Gray is lost!","It seems like James Gray is the man of one movie and has nothing left to say outside of the Russian community of New York. Like the lost city of Z, Ad astra is intensely boring. There is no rhythm at all in the succession of pointless events. At no moment we feel remotely concerned about what is happening. No character building, no tension, ridiculous inconsistencies, not even great images of space. A total an absolute failure"
"3946","Ad Astra",2,"painful","I was hoping to really like this but the plot, dialogue, and overall storyline for Ad Astra were at best, mediocre. The film was over-cast. I was fooled by big movie production folks. Brad, why did you allow this to happen to us?"
"3947","Ad Astra",9,"Much better than expected","So, reading reviews is not always the best thing to do. Sure, the movie is not fast nor continuously sensational, but it really is a solid slow burner. A powerful story that asks the right questions and gives beautiful answers. An intelligent movie you might say. Great acting too. It reminded me a bit of Apocalypse Now, where a fallen hero/monster needs to be stopped and the protagonist, while taking on the quest, finds himself on a journey of personal growth. Sure, the science is probably ridiculous at times, but so it is in Star Wars. If you can get past that it is definitely worth your time. Enjoy."
"3948","Ad Astra",9,"A beautiful space epic about the true journey of depression","'Ad Astra' was a film I knew nothing about going in, and i'm glad I went in blind. It was visually gorgeous with nail biting set pieces, but the story hit me in just the right spot. It takes a good script for you to hear voice over in lieu of dialogue and not feel like you're being cheated, and this script was, in my mind, excellent. It's a vibe-y film that spends a lot of time in silence, and if you're like me you'll really appreciate the time it takes to develop the emotional and visual severity. On its surface it's a space epic, but in its heart it will speak to victims of depression, as well as anyone who's ever spent years feeling like they didn't belong. It takes a journey greater than most are wiling to take to find your deepest demons and confront them. Absolutely loved it."
"3949","Ad Astra",4,"Pathetic Story-Line","In the whole movie, you expect something to happen, from start to end, you sit there and wait for the movie to actually begin but it gets more disappointing as time passes."
"3950","Ad Astra",9,"Much more than your typical sci-fi blockbuster","I love seeing different ways in which new space films can expand the genre. Ad Astra takes the unique approach of mostly avoiding thrills in favor of a deep dive into the protagonist's psyche. While some may argue about Gray's approach, I believe the film's resolution more than justifies this tactic. Brad Pitt gives a tremendous, understated performance in which you really feel the emotions his character experiences. The cinematography by Hoyte Van Hoytema is truly stunning and produced several shots which will likely live on in space film history. A beautiful score and story round out this brilliant, introspective space character study."
"3951","Ad Astra",6,"Very stylistic movie - Venice 76 review","I have just seen movie at the Venice film festival.
A few quick thoughts
-great cinematography(Hoyte has done it again) and acting from Brad and Tommy
-there are a couple of interesting scenes that I did not really expect in the middle of the movie
-sound editing top notchIt is a movie more for the critics and lovers of cinema art , and less for general public wanting some space sci-fi epic.
But everyone will find somethig to enjoy in this film and I reccomend to see it !"
"3952","Ad Astra",4,"Good intentions do not equal good execution","I was disappointed by this movie. It fails to deliver a coherent character arc for the protagonist despite being a character based film. It attempts to have multiple subplots that end in simplistic and mutually contradictory ways. If you can't write an ending that ties up all subplots in a satisfactory manner, drop some of the subplots.The visual effects and overall visual presentation in this movie are good, but there are also scenes that feel like they're there so the film can be falsely presented as an action blockbuster in marketing. There are overlooked details, like the gravity on the Moon, so obvious that they ruin the immersion in the movie.Overall, this film had potential, and credit has to be given for trying to create a more complex film in today's age of mass-market reboots and sequels. However, it failed to do so, and several scenes scream studio interference (not a surprise in hindsight, given the Mouse delaying the release of the movie after a hostile takeover of 20th Century Fox)."
"3953","Ad Astra",7,"A series of unfortunate space-related events","Ad Astra had its moments but it was underwhelming and a bit light on hard science. The low/no gravity seemed to be poorly and inconsistently portrayed. It definitely seemed like it was trying to be more meaningful and worthy than I think it was. And it had typical tropes that seemed lazy and unnecessary. I enjoyed it enough and the sets, costumes and props were quite wonderful of course but it was ultimately quite forgettable and nonsensical.I'm sure it was trying to say something about the mental journey of the main character rather than his space-faring one, but I don't know what it was. Could also be called ""A series of unfortunate space-related events""."
"3954","Ad Astra",8,"Gorgeous","Explore the galaxy. Search for extraterrestrial intelligence. Are we alone in the universe? Are we self-destructive? Are we willing to continue until the end regardless of the consequences? Do we become what we judge without realizing it? The story that the film tells us has a very deep meaning and explores the most hidden corners of the human being. A slow movie that goes through the stages of degradation and collapse of an individual feeling lost and the will to continue forward and get up to reach a goal. The sound and score, the photography, the scenarios and landscapes, the cinematography, the direction and the colours are really gorgeous."
"3955","Ad Astra",2,"Worst Brad Pitt film ever!","The entire movie seems to be a personal catharsis of Brad Pitt towards his children and / or his ex-wife. a mea-culpa made film.A total disaster from the plot, interpretative and visual point of view.It's been a while since I've seen such a bad movie, neglected in basic details, with exaggerated film licenses taked to the absurd (An astronaut with white suit, swimming in an underground lake, running through the sands of Mars and when it enters the rocket ... it's of pure white!)Pathetic from any perspective, save the money and go out to look at the starry sky, it will give you more satisfaction than this garbage!"
"3956","Ad Astra",1,"Utterly Awful","This movie has no point. It was total rubbish and even Brad could not save it. What was the point of it all? Started off well and spiralled out of control. Don't waste your money."
"3957","Jojo Rabbit",10,"I laughed and I cried","This film was exceptional and one of the best I've seen this year. Watiti has great comedic vision and the cast is phenomenal. Jojo Rabbit was wierd , funny , heartwarming and heartbreaking and I think its definitely worth the watch."
"3958","Jojo Rabbit",10,"Moving, hilarious...tragic","The trailer for the movie had me scratching my head but as a HUGE fan of Waititi I felt I ought to give it a shot.My best spoiler free review is that this is an original, outrageous film. The emotional gamut we are subjected to is whiplash inducing, but without the neck brace and ambulance chasing lawyers.Every actor is perfection. Young JoJo and Yorkie are devastatingly earnest and so talented. Sam Rockwell is always a master. Every subtle satire is underwritten with a grim level of truth. The soundtrack n unexpected choice.Go see it. Prepare yourself for quite a ride."
"3959","Jojo Rabbit",9,"From crying with laughter to tears of despair","For me this film is a total paradox. I have never laughed so hard in one scene and then cried like a baby in the next. It's unique. Go watch."
"3960","Jojo Rabbit",10,"Humanity at its best","So good. Taika makes you experience joy, terror, love, hate all in one minute and then he jumps out and runs around in a Hitler costume.It's historically accurate too showing the polarisation of Germany during war time, indoctrination into the hitler youth and the storming of Berlin.100% would watch again."
"3961","Jojo Rabbit",10,"Don't listen to critics and see it for yourself","Just watch it and see for yourself. My opinion, it was hilarious and heartfelt. The acting was superb. The story was thought provoking. It was funny at times and heartbreaking at times. I'm a huge fan of What We Do in the Shadows and I am huge fan of JoJo Rabbit. Go support this film in the theatre so more films like this can be made. I can't wait to see what Taika Waititi does next<U+0001F64F><U+0001F3FB>

"3962","Jojo Rabbit",9,"A heartfelt satire needed for today","Probably one of the most controversial films to come out of TIFF, I went into Jojo Rabbit with cautionious optimism since I am fan of Taika Waititi while still being aware of the divineness it has spawned in some critics. I was pleasantly surprised on how emotional and thought provoking he made this film while still being very funny without going too far.Jojo is a 10-year old boy who dreams of fighting for his country and making his hero proud. And that hero just so happens to be Adolf Hitler during the final year of WW2. Jojo's blind fanaticism is so extreme he imagines Adolf as his best friend to give him advice, which to no surprise, is not that helpful. After an accident at the Hitler Youth camp, Jojo has to stay with his mother only to discover she is hiding Elsa, a teenage girl who is the very thing his Nazis beliefs have told him to fear and hate: a Jew. As Jojo tries to learn about Elsa's ""kind"", he begins to sees Elsa as the thoughtful yet scared person she really is and not the monster his beliefs have told her to be.The smartest thing I can say is Waitia knows when to make a joke about Nazi's beliefs and ideals but then let the bleakness of WW2 set in to embrace the deeper themes and emotions. Within the first act, Jojo sees his world through rose-tinted glasses as he gleefully gives the Nazi salute to his fellow neighbours on a bright sunny day. All of the Nazi characters are heightened and exaggerated for comic relief from Sam Rockwell's Captain Klenzendorf being a tired and annoyed German soldier, Rebel Wilson as the ignorant Fraulein Rahm to Stephen Merchant as the Gestapo agent Deertz. Waititi takes pleasure in making Nazis the but of the joke from showing them being over-committed to saluting each other for just a simple introduction to their obliviousness of believing any stupid fake news they are told came from Hilter himself.
Once Jojo settles with Elsa sharing his house, his world begins show its true ugliness as Germany becomes more desperate to hold their ground against the Allied forces. At that point Waititi slows down on the comedy and allows moments of shock and drama to settle in to remind the audience what is the horrible cost of ignorance and blind faith. Cinematographer Mihai Malaimare Jr. switches the color scheme from bright and saturated to cold and grey as the seasons pass to reflect the change in Jojo's state of mind. The parallels to the modern day become very clear without getting too blunt.The cast plays each of their roles perfectly. Roman Griffin Davis carries the story as a naïve but yet innocence Jojo. Davis is perfectly cast with perfect comedic timing while still being able to sell the emotional beats that are needed. And he has great comedic and emotional chemistry with Thomasin McKenzie as Elsa. McKenzie displays the hardship her character has gone throughout her life and yet still making her fun and sharp-witted when she points out shallowness of Jojo's ideals. Also who is worth mentioning is Scarlett Johansson as Jojo's mother Rosie. Probably the best performance of Johansson I have seen so far, she brings a huge feeling of joy and optimism that is needed to help Jojo's growth as a character. Out of all of the adults that are blind to the horrors the Axis power is inflicting upon the world, Rosie is the only one that is able to see through it and confront it. As for the big question of Waititi himself playing a young boy's interpretation of Adolf Hitler, he handles it very well. His comedic performance is there to show the absurdity of Jojo's brainwashing from the Nazis's teaching. And it helps that he never to tries to humanize the portrayal of his character. There were even a few moments where he becomes a bit more antagonistic towards Jojo as he begins doubting the faith in his idol.Jojo Rabbit may be a controversial pick if it does get nominated for awards consideration (after I saw it on the last day of TIFF, it surprisingly won the People's Choice Award), but I feel like it is a movie needed for today's political issues. Taika Waititi uses the story of a boy's misguided fantasy and faith to show how easy it is for society to be manipulated into hating minorities, religions and/or groups of people especially when fake news and social media is present. But by the end of the day he shows that compassion and love are still worth embracing in a cruel world so as long as we are able to confront to cruelty in ourselves first."
"3963","Jojo Rabbit",10,"Great actors, great messages","As a German, I loved everything about this movie. Absurdity from these times is captured amazingly, and now, almost a century afterwards, we can take it with some humor. Well done, I hope this movie goes on to win some awards."
"3964","Jojo Rabbit",9,"There is hope","Jojo Rabbit demonstrates that there is hope, both for humanity and Hollywood. By the latter I mean it's hard to imagine how a film this original got made in an era of reboots, remakes, sequels and prequels (mostly bad)The characters are charming and quirky, the dialogue clever and the plot wisely confines itself to telling an intensely personal story rather than one of the war itself. The young male star is perfect, and the other performances shine as well. It does seem though that Scarlett got less time on the screen than she deserves.The director cleverly doesn't show us certain things, and a lot of good choices were made in the editing room.Hollywood, if you're listening, more like this please."
"3965","Jojo Rabbit",9,"A little masterpiece.","Among the best poetic anti war films made. Congratulations."
"3966","Jojo Rabbit",10,"See Jojo Rabbit like your life depends on it!","I laughed. I cried.. Thank you, Taika Waititi, for this amazing film!Hands-down the best I've seen in 2019!"
"3967","Jojo Rabbit",8,"If you think this is offensive you need to look up Satire in the dictionary","This is fantastic Political Satire; we need to be able use Satire in the correct way and Waititi did just that. If you think this movie is offensive here is Satires definition:Satire

"3969","Jojo Rabbit",10,"In my all time top 10","I was amazed by the ability of this movie to evoke such polarised emotions. Just watched it again (4th time) and was still riveted to the screen. A tick in every box and a modern masterpiece. I want to single out a performance, but which one. We all know Sam Rockwell is brilliant in everything he does, but we need more of Scarlet in roles that display her awesome talent and screen presence. Roman Griffin Davis and Thomasin McKenzie shone as the lead characters and we will see much more of them I'm sure. But when a movie is this good, it comes down to writing, script, screenplay and direction. The word Masterpiece shouldn't be used lightly, but I use it here."
"3970","Jojo Rabbit",9,"Taika Waititi is one of the best directors in Hollywood right now.","JoJo Rabbit is a brilliant and brave attempt by Taika Waititi. This movie is crafted by pure creativity. 'An anti hate satire' is the tagline of the movie and the movie shows the Nazi era difficulties through humour and mind blowing dialogue (most from Scarlett Johansson). This was the year that I realised ScaJoh is an excellent actress. All of the cast was excellent including Roman Griffin Davies, Thomasin McKenzie (who both have a bright future), Taika Waititi, Rebel Wilson and an excellent Sam Rockwell. The fat boy also deserves mentioned. JoJo Rabbit deserves acclaim and more people should see it. I don't know why most of the critics hated it but screw them. Jojo Rabbit deserved that Oscar nod for Best Picture and even though there's no hope for winning it, I'm pretty sure the movie has inspired so much hearts and this movie will discussed in the future."

"3972","Jojo Rabbit",9,"Sometimes All We Need To Do Is Dance","I've always said that a great ending can elevate your opinion on the film as a whole. Perhaps not completely shift how you feel, but certainly enhance or detract. I was enjoying the ride with Jojo Rabbit for awhile but I was waiting for the film to move me emotionally the way I'd heard it might. The last 15-20 minutes of the movie do just that. Boasting a hilarious script, unique direction from Taika, terrific performances all around, and a message that is as moving as any film this year, Jojo Rabbit is a win on all accounts. And perhaps, just the movie we need at this time. I absolutely adored this film.9.4/10"
"3973","Jojo Rabbit",7,"Very funny, though it falls short of what it could be","""Jojo Rabbit"" is a light-hearted comedy exploring dark elements. It tells the story of a 10-year-old boy growing up in Germany near the end of World War II. He's a lot like other boys his age, struggling to fit in and find his way, searching for group and sense of belonging. Unlike a lot of boys his age, he is a passionate Nazi who gleefully exclaims, ""Heil Hitler!"" as he skips down the street to a camp for young Nazis-in-training. Accompanying him as he skips, cheering him on, is his imaginary friend, Adolf Hitler, himself.Hitler, played with uproarious levels of buffoonery by writer/director Taika Waititi, provides many of the film's early laughs. Sadly, the movie fails to deliver on its early promise. It doesn't crash burn - the end product is still respectable - but all the parts never totally come together in a completely satisfying way. We hope for more from a proven entity like Waititi.The title ""Jojo Rabbit,"" as it turns out, is half the name of the 10-year-old boy and half the name of a cute, fluffy animal. Jojo (Roman Griffin Davis) becomes the begrudging recipient of the nickname ""Jojo Rabbit"" for his choice to not coldly murder an innocent rabbit while at Nazi camp. An older boy makes a different choice regarding the rabbit, then callously chucks the body across the woods.Jojo doesn't fit in here. He doesn't want to be a Nazi. He just doesn't know it yet.Jojo lives with his loving, playful mother, Rosie (Scarlett Johansson), who secretly works for the resistance. However, she allows Jojo to follow his misguided Nazi ways, knowing this will keep him safe from party members who search the town for dissenters. Johansson plays the part with impressive layers of complexity. While appalled by her son's Nazi passion, she understands that now is not the time to reprimand him. She quietly does her work and continues to love her son dearly, which is precisely why she opts not to tell Jojo about the young Jewish girl she is hiding in her wall.When Jojo finds the girl (Thomasin McKenzie), he is shocked and horrified. But he quickly discovers that she isn't at all the way Jews have been described to him. ""Where are your horns?"" He asks her sincerely.It's not long before Jojo begins to realize the girl he has been told is a monster is actually a friend, while his imaginary friend is the real monster. If you've seen any movies before, you know this is coming. Nevertheless, a few moments successfully tug at the heart strings. Another moment doesn't work quite as well and ends up feeling forced, even manipulative.The movie's execution winds up being a bit disappointing because of how much potential seemed possible in the opening act. The best moments are the funniest ones, usually featuring Hitler and Jojo, along with a few others that include the scene-stealing Archie Yates, who plays Jojo's friend.Despite the movie's success in comedic execution, the heavier material waivers, leaving the vision of the story a bit foggy. What could have been a best-of-the-year contender, winds up being merely an above average comedy."
"3974","Jojo Rabbit",10,"Funny, Poignant, Irreverent. The Guardian Hated It!","Jojo is a proud Hitler Youth member. He decides to go on a weekend for fellow brainwashed enthusiasts. However, after a (very funny) accident with a grenade he finds himself hospitalised. At home recovering he discovers that his mother is hiding a Jewish girl in their home. He confides this to his imaginary friend, Adolf Hitler (!)This film is actually a comedy! An off the wall, zany and irreverant comedy that works beautifully. It was a massive gamble to make such a film in such oversensitive and 'woke' times. And it was Disney of all studios that made Jojo Rabbit! Should such a terrible period from history be depicted in such a chirpy and comical way? Should Hitler be portrayed as such a goofball within the film? YES! Whether it's Mel Brooks (who said he loved JoJo Rabbit) with The Producers and it's musical Springtime For Hitler or Joan Rivers making her controversial joke about the Holocaust on Fashion Police, humour reaches the parts that more earnest and serious pieces of 'art' can't. It forces you to laugh at whatever is the target of the joke is and then analyse why you laughed at something that you normally wouldn't see as comical.Whilst most critics have lauded the film, there are peripheral pundits who have either said that the filmmakers have gone too far (How dare they make a comedy starring Adolf Hitler?!) or that they didn't go far enough (How dare they make a film about Nazi Germany and not show the full horror of what happened?!). The Guardian hated the film which is another reason for audiences go and see this gem of a film.But, understandably, everything depicted in the film isn't just for laughs. There are plenty of gut-wrenching moments when the full horror is brought home to the characters and audience alike. These poignant sequences aren't milked for all their worth and this makes them all the more powerful and genuine. There were a couple of pivotal scenes which made me fight back tears. These scenes were played out for what they were without the whole film descending into a tissue-soaking cry-a-thon which would have cheapened and devalued the movie's content.The film also looks beautiful with set designs and a colour palate that makes Jojo Rabbit a feast for the eyes. This film is beautifully constructed. Jojo's room, the house in which he resides, the cubby hole that houses Elsa and the surrounding environs are all aesthetically pleasing and a joy to behold.Also, check out the framing. Every scene feels just as quirky, off-kilter and as warped as the narrative. Watch out for the scene on the giant steps and the later scene with it's emphasis on a character's shoes and how this motif is used later on in the film in an extremely heartbreaking but dignified and tasteful way.The soundtrack is also fantastic with The Beatles' German language version of I Wanna Hold Your Hand ('Komm, gib mir deine Hand') and Bowie's Helden leading the way. In fact, these two rather obscure (to English eyes anyway) versions of well known songs normally heard in their Mother Tongue depict the whole feel of the film- off kilter, eschew and very original.There are uniformly amazing performances by the likes of Roman Griffin Davis playing Jojo, Scarlett Johannsen as his mother, Thomasin McKenzie as Elsa the Jewish hideaway and Sam Rockwell (great to see him taking more risks with his choice of roles after starring in the ultra-woke and unbearable Three Billboards). Also, look out for Stephen Merchant as a very sinister Nazi inspector. He reminded me of The Demon Headmaster. But it's director and screenwriter Taika Waititi who plays Adolf Hitler who steals the show. Every scene that hes in is comedy gold as he depicts Hitler as a kind of bro/dude best friend to Jojo. His lines and mannerisms are laugh out loud hysterical.4 parts humour, 1 part sentiment, this film has a power that will seep into your brain during it's running time and stay with you long after the film is over. In fact my first thought on leaving the cinema was that I wanted to see it again.I feel privileged to have seen one of the best films of 2020 on Jan the 1st of this year. A cracking start to a new decade of movies."
"3975","Jojo Rabbit",10,"A surprisingly great movie","It should have won best picture. An amazing movie and a surprise."
"3976","Jojo Rabbit",5,"Really disappointed","I was really disappointed in this film and I honestly dont get all the 10/10 scores. The acting was good, but the dialogue was mind numbing to the point I almost fell asleep. I get what it was about but I didnt find it very funny or heartwarming or any of the other thing others thought of it. I really wanted to like it but ultimately, didnt."
"3977","Jojo Rabbit",10,"Truly wonderful","Everyone should see this movie. It makes you feel every possible emotion."
"3978","Jojo Rabbit",4,"A limp, tame, not-particularly-original attempt at satire","Let's cut right to the chase: Jojo Rabbit is every bit as original and effective a satire as Hogan's Heroes. It takes precisely the same approach to the Nazis, broadly caricaturing them as bumbling idiots and two-dimensional bullies. So it's no surprise that JoJo suffers from exactly the same problem as Hogan's Heroes: there's nothing real or threatening or genuinely sinister about these Nazis. They're just buffoons. Perhaps JoJo is marginally more daring in going so far as to depict Hitler himself, but Waititi's Fuhrer is as flimsy and fey as Mel Brook's take on him in Springtime For Hitler - only without the biting, derisive satire and the consistent hilarity. How funny you find JoJo Rabbit will likely depend on whether you also find The Three Stooges and Road Runner cartoons laugh-out-loud funny, for that's the level of most of what passes for humour here. If this is what passes for ""comedy genius"" and 10 out of 10 film-making in the 21st century, then heaven help us all."
"3979","Jojo Rabbit",5,"Hmmm.","I'm usually quite decisive when it comes to rating films, but Jojo Rabbit has me in a bit of a quandry. I enjoyed the touching storyline of 10-year-old 'Hitler youth' Jojo (Roman Griffin Davis) befriending Elsa (Thomasin McKenzie), the Jewish girl he finds hiding in his home. And I enjoyed the general irreverent tone and quirky satire. But I didn't laugh. Not once. And since I believe this is intended to be a comedy, I can't say that it is a complete success. A rating of 5 feels a little unfair, since the film is an undeniably unique and visually impressive experience, but at the same time it seems like a reasonable score for something that has left me feeling unsatisfied as a whole.I definitely wish that Roman Griffin Davis and Archie Yates (who plays Jojo's friend Yorki) hadn't filmed an introduction for the preview I attended: it made it harder to accept them as their characters, which, to be honest, wasn't that easy in the first place because neither is particularly convincing. The adults are far better, with Stephen Merchant as a nasty Gestapo officer Deertz almost making me smile, and Sam Rockwell shining as Captain Klenzendorf, a disillusioned soldier who isn't as bad as he first seems. Director Taika Waititi mercilessly mocks Adolf Hitler, who appears to Jojo as an imaginary friend - he's fun (but not funny). Scarlett Johansson is extremely likeable as Jojo's loving mother, and even Rebel Wilson, who I normally can't stand, was bearable as cruel Nazi Fraulein Rahm.5/10. I might like it more on a second viewing. Then again, I might dislike it more."
"3980","Jojo Rabbit",4,"Incredibly overrated.","Mildly amusing (and occasionally sad) take on nazi-era Germany. That's all.
A very small movie that was somehow blown all out of proportion.
This in one of those movies that In 5 years, we'll be wondering wth we were thinking in 2020 to include this in Oscar categories.
More importantly, we'll even forget this movie existed."
"3981","Jojo Rabbit",10,"This movie is fantastic!","It's a really weird idea, it's a cutesy Wes Anderson/Calvin & Hobbes-style comedy about a little boy, his imaginary friend and his adventures growing up. It just so happens that that little boy is a Hitler Youth, his imaginary friend is Adolf Hitler and he's growing up in Nazi Germany during WWII. This movie is very funny. It has a ton of comedy both light and very dark! Don't be fooled, though. This is less The Producers or Look Who's Back and more Life is Beautiful. There are some seriously heavy and tragic parts in this movie that I don't dare spoil here. While it is a commentary about how childish the whole idea of Naziism is, it is also about the horrors of indoctrination and intolerance and the damages they can inflict. Great performances, beautiful costumes and cinematography and with a brilliant script, this is a must-see! One of my favourites of 2019!"
"3982","Pulp Fiction",10,"The masterpiece without a message","One of the early scenes in ""Pulp Fiction"" features two hit-men discussing what a Big Mac is called in other countries. Their dialogue is witty and entertaining, and it's also disarming, because it makes these two thugs seem all too normal. If you didn't know better, you might assume these were regular guys having chit-chat on their way to work. Other than the comic payoff at the end of the scene, in which they use parts of this conversation to taunt their victims, their talk has no relevance to anything in the film, or to anything else, for that matter. Yet without such scenes, ""Pulp Fiction"" wouldn't be ""Pulp Fiction."" I get the sense that Tarantino put into the film whatever struck his fancy, and somehow the final product is not only coherent but wonderfully textured.It's no wonder that fans spend so much time debating what was in the suitcase, reading far more into the story than Tarantino probably intended. The film is so intricately structured, with so many astonishing details, many of which you won't pick up on the first viewing, that it seems to cry out for some deeper explanation. But there is no deeper explanation. ""Pulp Fiction,"" is, as the title indicates, purely an exercise in technique and style, albeit a brilliant and layered one. Containing numerous references to other films, it is like a great work of abstract art, or ""art about art."" It has all the characteristics we associate with great movies: fine writing, first-rate acting, unforgettable characters, and one of the most well-constructed narratives I've ever seen in a film. But to what end? The self-contained story does not seem to have bearing on anything but itself.The movie becomes a bit easier to understand once you realize that it's essentially a black comedy dressed up as a crime drama. Each of the three main story threads begins with a situation that could easily form the subplot of any standard gangster movie. But something always goes wrong, some small unexpected accident that causes the whole situation to come tumbling down, leading the increasingly desperate characters to absurd measures. Tarantino's originality stems from his ability to focus on small details and follow them where they lead, even if they move the story away from conventional plot developments.Perhaps no screenplay has ever found a better use for digressions. Indeed, the whole film seems to consist of digressions. No character ever says anything in a simple, straightforward manner. Jules could have simply told Yolanda, ""Be cool and no one's going to get hurt,"" which is just the type of line you'd find in a generic, run-of-the-mill action flick. Instead, he goes off on a tangent about what Fonzie is like. Tarantino savors every word of his characters, finding a potential wisecrack in every statement and infusing the dialogue with clever pop culture references. But the lines aren't just witty; they are full of intelligent observations about human behavior. Think of Mia's statement to Vincent, ""That's when you know you've found somebody special: when you can just shut the f--- up for a minute and comfortably enjoy the silence.""What is the movie's purpose exactly? I'm not sure, but it does deal a lot with the theme of power. Marsellus is the sort of character who looms over the entire film while being invisible most of the time. The whole point of the big date sequence, which happens to be my favorite section of the film, is the power that Marsellus has over his men without even being present. This power is what gets Vincent to act in ways you would not ordinarily expect from a dumb, stoned gangster faced with an attractive woman whose husband has gone away. The power theme also helps explain one of the more controversial aspects of the film, its liberal use of the N-word. In this film, the word isn't just used as an epithet to describe blacks: Jules, for instance, at one point applies the term to Vincent. It has more to do with power than with race. The powerful characters utter the word to express their dominance over weaker characters. Most of these gangsters are not racist in practice. Indeed, they are intermingled racially, and have achieved a level of equality that surpasses the habits of many law-abiding citizens in our society. They resort to racial epithets because it's a patter that establishes their separateness from the non-criminal world.There's a nice moral progression to the stories. We presume that Vincent hesitates to sleep with Mia out of fear rather than loyalty. Later, Butch's act of heroism could be motivated by honor, but we're never sure. The film ends, however, with Jules making a clear moral choice. Thus, the movie seems to be exploring whether violent outlaws can act other than for self-preservation.Still, it's hard to find much of a larger meaning tying together these eccentric set of stories. None of the stories are really ""about"" anything. They certainly are not about hit-men pontificating about burgers. Nor is the film really a satire or a farce, although it contains elements of both. At times, it feels like a tale that didn't need to be told, but for whatever reason this movie tells it and does a better job than most films of its kind, or of any other kind."
"3983","Pulp Fiction",10,"The rebirth of a genre  and film history","I can only speak for myself, but I had never seen anything as stylish, cleverly constructed, well written and electrifying as this milestone when I first saw it in 1994. What really pulled me in right from the start is what we've now come to know as a Tarantino trademark: the dialogue. When gangsters Jules and Vincent talk to each other (or all the other characters, for that matter) there is a natural flow, a sense of realism and yet something slightly over the top and very theatrical about their lines  it's a mixture that immediately grabs your attention (even if it's just two dudes talking about what kind of hamburger they prefer, or contemplating the value of a foot-massage). Then there's the music: the songs Tarantino chose for his masterpiece fit their respective scenes so perfectly that most of those pieces of music are now immediately associated with 'Pulp Fiction'. And the narrative: the different story lines that come together, the elegantly used flashbacks, the use of ""chapters""  there is so much playful creativity at play here, it's just a pure joy to watch.If you're a bit of a film geek, you realize how much knowledge about film and love for the work of other greats  and inspiration from them - went into this (Leone, DePalma, Scorsese and, of course, dozens of hyper-stylized Asian gangster flicks), but to those accusing Tarantino of copying or even ""stealing"" from other film-makers I can only say: There has never been an artist who adored his kind of art that was NOT inspired or influenced by his favorite artists. And if you watch Tarantino's masterpiece today, it's impossible not to recognize just what a breath of fresh air it was (still is, actually). Somehow, movies - especially gangster films - never looked quite the same after 'Pulp Fiction'. Probably the most influential film of the last 20 years, it's got simply everything: amazing performances (especially Sam Jackson); it features some of the most sizzling, iconic dialogue ever written; it has arguably one of the best non-original soundtracks ever - it's such a crazy, cool, inspirational ride that you feel dizzy after watching it for the first time. It's  well: it's 'Pulp Fiction'. 10 stars out of 10.Favorite films: http://www.IMDb.com/list/mkjOKvqlSBs/Lesser-known Masterpieces: http://www.imdb.com/list/ls070242495/Favorite TV-Shows reviewed: http://www.imdb.com/list/ls075552387/"
"3984","Pulp Fiction",10,"Simply The Best","To put this in context, I am 34 years old and I have to say that this is the best film I have seen without doubt and I don't expect it will be beaten as far as I am concerned. Obviously times move on, and I acknowledge that due to its violence and one particularly uncomfortable scene this film is not for everyone, but I still remember watching it for the first time, and it blew me away. Anyone who watches it now has to remember that it actually changed the history of cinema. In context- it followed a decade or more of action films that always ended with a chase sequence where the hero saved the day - you could have written those films yourself. Pulp had you gripped and credited the audience with intelligence. There is not a line of wasted dialogue and the movie incorporates a number of complexities that are not immediately obvious. It also resurrected the career of Grease icon John Travolta and highlighted the acting talent of Samuel L Jackson. There are many films now that are edited out of sequence and have multiple plots etc but this is the one they all want to be, or all want to beat, but never will."
"3985","Pulp Fiction",10,"The Movie that redefined a genre","Viewers are taken on a ride through three different stories that entertwine together around the world of Marcellus Wallace. Quentin Tarantino proves that he is the master of witty dialogue and a fast plot that doesn't allow the viewer a moment of boredom or rest. From the story of two hit-man on a job, to a fixed boxing match to a date between a hit-man and the wife of a mob boss. There was definitely a lot of care into the writing of the script, as everything no matter the order it is in, fits with the story. Many mysteries have been left such as what is inside of the briefcase and why Marcellus Wallace has a band-aid on the back of his neck, which may be connected. The movie redefined the action genre and reinvigorated the careers of both John Travolta and Bruce Willis. This movie is required viewing for any fan of film."
"3986","Pulp Fiction",10,"SMOKIN CIGARETTES AND WATCHING CAPTAIN KANGAROO","A groundbreaking movie from QT that intertwines several stories,a couple of BONNIE and CLYDE type criminals kick of this ROLLER COASTER ride with a spontaneous madcap robbery,a couple of gangsters go to retrieve a suitcase for their boss with dire consequence and an ageing boxer has an early retirement bout arranged in his favor,each story unfolds in ultra violent fashion with characters crossing paths through a criminal and corrupt network,dialogue between each unique individual is world class as the balance between humor and terror is achieved beautifully.an all star cast featuring some of QTs favorites put in memorable performances here and JOHN TRAVOLTA reinvents himself and plays VINCENT flawlessly.written and directed by QT this is one of the best crime movies ever made and caps off a crime trilogy from QT in only the space of 3 years - RESERVOIR DOGS 1992 - TRUE ROMANCE 1993 and now PULP FICTION 1994 - truly amazing.........."
"3987","Pulp Fiction",10,"Unbelievable.","Pulp Fiction may be the single best film ever made, and quite appropriately it is by one of the most creative directors of all time, Quentin Tarantino. This movie is amazing from the beginning definition of pulp to the end credits and boasts one of the best casts ever assembled with the likes of Bruce Willis, Samuel L. Jackson, John Travolta, Uma Thurman, Harvey Keitel, Tim Roth and Christopher Walken. The dialog is surprisingly humorous for this type of film, and I think that's what has made it so successful. Wrongfully denied the many Oscars it was nominated for, Pulp Fiction is by far the best film of the 90s and no Tarantino film has surpassed the quality of this movie (although Kill Bill came close). As far as I'm concerned this is the top film of all-time and definitely deserves a watch if you haven't seen it."
"3988","Pulp Fiction",NA,"It's Wild, It's Chaotic, It's Pulp Fiction!!!","My oh my.  ""Pulp Fiction"" is one of those roller-coasters of a movie.  It is both a joy and a trial to sit through.  Amazingly original and unforgettable, Quentin Tarantino's trash masterpiece never gets old or seem outdated.  It put a face on American independent film making in 1994. Miramax had been around since the 1970s and no one had heard of it before this film.  Studios went into a panic when this film came out because they knew it would be an amazing hit.  Of course it was.  Independent film making became the rage and hit its peak in 1996 when four of the five nominated Best Picture films were from independent studios.  The screenplay and direction by Tarantino are quite amazing, but the cast makes the film work. John Travolta (Oscar nominated) re-invented his career with this film. Bruce Willis cemented his celebrity.  Samuel L. Jackson and Uma Thurman (both Oscar nominees) became marketable superstars.  Others who make appearances include: Ving Rhames, Christopher Walken, Eric Stoltz, Rosanna Arquette, Steve Buscemi, Frank Whaley, Harvey Keitel, and of course Quentin Tarantino himself.  They all leave lasting impressions as well.  Samuel L. Jackson stood out the most to me, his lack of substantial screen time may have cost him the Oscar.  Just an amazing accomplishment, all involved deserve recognition.  Easily 5 stars out of 5."
"3989","Pulp Fiction",9,"Watch","This if you have not already.It is violent, action-packed and sexy.Watch it again if you have already. It is just too much fun to watch once."
"3990","Pulp Fiction",NA,"Great director. Great story. Great characters. A masterpiece","Tarantino is without a doubt one of the best directors of all time and maybe the best of the 90's. His first film, Reservoir Dogs was amazing and claustrophobic, his segment in Four Rooms was by far the greatest (even though Rodriguez's was excellent too)and Jackie Brown is a wonderful homage to the Blaxploitation films of the 70's. However, Pulp Fiction remains my favourite.It was nominated for so many Oscars that I still find it hard to believe that it only got one: Best original script. I'm not complaining because Forrest Gump got best picture, since that film was also Oscar-worthy, but come on, movies like Tarantino's or the Shawshank Redemption deserved much more.Anyway, going back to the movie, I particularly liked the first and second chapters, and that's really a contradiction because one of the movie's finest characters, Mr. Wolf, appears on the third. Bruce Willis also does a great job, and as far as I'm concerned he fell in love with the movie right after having read the script. I like the way his character gives a ""tough guy"" image at the beginning and then we discover he's so affectionate and tender to his wife. Travolta is obviously the star of the movie and his second encounter with Bruce Willis in the kitchen along with the scene where he dances with Uma Thurman is when the movie reaches it's highest point.The other star is Samuel L. Jackson, who plays a wise assassin that obviously knows how to handle situations. ""And I will strike down upon thee with great vengeance and furious anger..."" is my favourite quote.Summarizing, Pulp Fiction is a modern classic and a must-see for anyone who is at least aware of what a movie is. I give it a 9 out of 10."
"3991","Pulp Fiction",10,"Perfect Movie","This is my favorite film of all time. Every second of this film is engaging, and I'm not exaggerating when I say that. Tarantino's direction and script is brilliant, and every role is perfectly cast. Everything that happens in this movie has a purpose, and you don't realize it's hidden in plain sight until the final moments"
"3992","Pulp Fiction",10,"The most rewatchable movie of all time","Possibly the most influential movie made in history since the first movie ever made .Even after 25 years and a countless number of copy cats this movie absolutely holds up and feels fresh.
As many of you would know this movie is sort of like a tribute to the pulp stories written back in the 40s and 50s which have punchy and witty dialogue and over the top violence. The random chit chat between characters regarding obscure things might feel a waste of time as it doesn't move the plot. But Tarantino is a genius and he believes in character development more than plot development so these chats actually humanizes the characters a lot and makes them relatable and memorable(The absolute converse of Nolan). This movie is just a collection of wonderful scenes back to back from start to finish.. The movie is a must watch just for the awesome screenplay alone. To top it off all the actors arguably give their career best performance(think about it ,it is true) . And the ability of Tarantino to just create a really tense or ridiculous situation out of nowhere(like the psycho tribute scene with marsellus and butch which is so unexpected or that adrenaline shot scene) is just awesome and keeps you on the edge of your seats .So if you want an entertaining but clever movie this is the one you are looking for . It is funny, filled with some of the best dialogues ever ,superbly acted, great soundtracks(I just wanna see Tarantino's ipod , boy does he have great taste) and is just a spectacular experience.Spoilers ahead(duh):
For those of you who say the characters are hollow I suggest you to revisit the gold watch sequence. Walken's Capt Koons tells a story to young butch about how Butch's grandpa requested an enemy soldier to return his watch to his family and the soldier agreed. Similarly Butch could have left Marsellus but the legacy of his watch made him save him which I believe was a nice touch. And how Jules(one of my characters of all time) undergoes a change is also a noteworthy counter argument to the above mentioned criticism.Sorry for the huge review.."
"3993","Pulp Fiction",10,"One of the Best Film's I've Seen In A LONG Time... and still is","Quentin Tarantino's Pulp Fiction is a terrific film. It also gets better with each viewing, especially if one of those happens to be on a big theatrical screen where all of the BIG compositions get bigger and more detailed. How much else is there to talk about it after all these years? It's filled with dynamite, sudden and always interesting action, great and naturally clever dialogue, and memorable characters. Also, the acting is always something to behold as by turns straightforward, over the top, subtle, and just downright menacing and spot-on. The directing is one of the strongest that we've seen from Tarantino, as he makes his choices in pacing with shots in unconventional ways but never in a way that would be distracting. And writing, already noted, has been copied by many, and only equaled by a select few. The dance sequence. Samuel L. Jackson's superlative monologuing. It has loyalty among low lifes, and many other odd characters that are all bad and not one is a villain or hero. And somehow even after years of parody and terrible rip-offs, it holds its own and- as one can say after seeing it at a midnight screening- holds its audience as much as it had the countless times before they saw it (or if they are, the first time). The first time you're surprised, the second time you look for the clues or other ambiguity, and then the third time you laugh you head off. The fourth time... I'll leave to you."
"3994","Pulp Fiction",NA,"Awesome!","I just finished screening this movie for the first time after putting it off for a number of years because of what seemed like equivocating appraisals from some of my friends. In hindsight, however, it seems to me that while the movie must have definitely bowled them over, overall they weren't sure exactly what to make of it or how to articulate what were probably a confused mix of feelings. But I am so impressed that I feel compelled to add a few specific observations to the many fine reviews already on this database.First, this movie hits you with an impact somewhere in between, say, APOCALYPSE NOW and A CLOCKWORK ORANGE, and for some people may be just as disturbing (however, in this respect I am happy to report I didn't think it rose to the level of NATURAL BORN KILLERS). Full of graphically violent action and language, PULP FICTION is not a picture for everyone - I would definitely not recommend it to my parents, born in the 1930's (even to my one fairly ""hip"" relative of the same generation who, at age 66, still teaches high school sex education and likes to talk about things like sunbathing nude, among other potentially sensitive issues).Irrespective of audience sensibilities, however, the film-makers, supported by superb acting in every role, manage to create a world full of the most fascinating sleazy characters possibly ever to appear on screen. From Travolta's pronounced almost-child-like curiosity about the world to Jackson's sincere and thoughtful philosophical ruminating and Willis's deep devotion to the memory of his father, I think such fascination lies not only in the characters' personalities as they are portrayed but in the way they tantalize the viewer into considering the possibility that such people could actually exist. As a lawyer of some years' experience dealing with all sorts of people I was particularly drawn to this aspect of the film.Thus, and in response to some other reviewers' comments, I think this movie is more character-driven than plot-driven. Instead of a story peopled by basically weakly developed characters employed primarily as a mere device to move the plot along, as is too frequently the case in the movies (especially these days), the undeniably strong, clever, and unpredictable plot lines in PULP FICTION are actually of essentially secondary interest and importance, serving primarily as vehicles to get you worried about the fate of characters you can't help caring about despite the truly low attributes that otherwise form the basis for their respective personas. As at least one other reviewer noted, when the film ends you are actually disappointed, left craving more of these crazy people and their explosive lives.Finally, and as strange as it may sound, this film reminds me of another Monumentally Great Film which one would never typically associate with it in any way in a million years - CASABLANCA. As in that film made way back in 1942, and as another reviewer has suggested, perhaps its special appeal - its unusually high degree of emotional impact - lies in its distinctly successful simultaneous application of several different genres in a single film - drama, action, dark humor - with the whole thing bound together by essentially flawless execution in every department. And while CASABLANCA is no doubt clearly much more wholesome and high-minded, like the older film PULP FICTION is not without a pronounced theme of redemption, even if it is not as strongly felt, considering all the later film's sleaze and violence.In sum, when people say that this is probably the best film of the 1990's, it is easy to see why. Fundamentally a truly outstanding movie, it is a must-see for anyone who considers themself a film buff and can handle graphic subject matter.(Incidentally, if you would like a more toned-down, much more overtly humorous and less serious picture with a not-altogether dissimilar look and feel, don't miss another 1990's Travolta picture, GET SHORTY.)"
"3995","Pulp Fiction",NA,"Hands down, the best film of the '90s.","Pulp Fiction, despite borrowing from just about every movie ever made, is the most invigorating cinema experience a filmgoer can ever hope for. Its hodgepodge of violence, mayhem, and generally deviant behavior is an assault on the senses, not to mention political correctness. However, despite all the film's cleverness and style, it hinges on the performance put forth by Samuel L. Jackson as Jules. The fact that he was denied an Oscar is a downright shame. Martin Landau, the best supporting actor winner that year, was terrific and funny in Ed Wood, but Jackson was perhaps the most commanding screen presence in film history as the bible-quoting, godfearing hitman. The last scene in the coffee shop with Tim Roth still sends chills down my spine, no matter how many times I've seen it. Rumors of a prequel involving Jules and Vincent (John Travolta) have been floating around lately. If Quentin Tarantino wishes to regain the fans he lost with the dissapointing (but still pretty good) Jackie Brown, he should get to work right away. I'll be the first in line to see the finished product."
"3996","Pulp Fiction",6,"A masterpiece? Do me a favour!","A masterpiece? Do me a favour! Perhaps it's because of the hype that surrounds this film, but I was really disappointed with what I saw.Two and a half hours was too long in my view, and nothing particularly out of the ordinary happens.I didn't find it clever, nor were the ""unforgettable"" scenes like the dance between Travolta and Thurman or Samuel L Jackson's speech unforgettable.Maybe because cinema has advanced so much since 1994 that I would have had to watch it then to appreciate it, but I only recently saw Hitchcock's Rear Window for the first time and enjoyed that immensely.People go on as if this film has the best storyline and gangster scenes ever but quite frankly, it doesn't.Moreover, I found Natural Born Killers more affective for it's style than Pulp Fiction.It does have some good scenes, and I was rooting for Bruce Willis' character throughout, but I saw nothing that makes this film outstanding or worthy of being so high in IMDb's rankings."
"3997","Pulp Fiction",5,"I can't understand why this film got this high ranking!","I was tempted to stop watching it about four times. I went up to the end just to see if, at least, there is something extraordinary or unexpected there. I really can't understand what all these viewers found to this film, to score it so high. It's the first time (or the second I'm not sure!) that I get into the mood of writing a review. The reason, I guess, is because this film is the fifth in the top 250 ranking and I couldn't see why. The curiosity of the ranking was also the reason of watching it at the first place. There is a high end casting and a top level director but nothing more, IN MY OPINION. I tried looking it through the eyes of 1994 but still compared to other productions of the age is far behind. If you find yourself in the position wondering whether to watch this film or not, due to its place in the list<U+0085> don't waste your time!"
"3998","Pulp Fiction",10,"Disable to define itself, yet the coolest film ever","Pulp fiction is one of the most revolutionary films in the industry. It is funny, chaotic and entertaining. The film itself never tried to play it cool. And that is what makes it so captivating; its unwillingness to look cool and deep(like every Tarantino film) charms every viewer. Pulp fiction compaired to every other film of the industry probably looks like that one girl in the club that you will never see again but you will likely keep fantasizing of forever;She is totally indifferent and bored, effortlessly cool and gives the best laughs. Wait... Mia Wallace, is that you???"
"3999","Pulp Fiction",10,"Wish I had seen it sooner.","I've heard about this film for years. I always pushed it away because I thought old films weren't really my thing. They were always so raw but too long for me. But pulp fiction has to be one of the best films. I have never seen such a comedic and raw movie that would keep me at the edge of my seat. The fact that the first scene fitted so well with the last scene is amazing."
"4000","Pulp Fiction",10,"Classic tarantino","Great movie tarantinos best ,
watch IT if you don't you have missed out, so watch IT and enjoy!!!"
"4001","Pulp Fiction",5,"Enormously Overrated","The proof of the pudding, they say, is in the eating. The proof of the movie is in the watching. Most of the top 250 IMDb movies have kept me glued to my seat--with this one I found my mind wandering to that jigsaw puzzle I hadn't finished or the possibility of some popcorn. I found I had very little interest in the characters or in what was going on.I asked myself why. Technically the film is very good. The actors all hit their marks and Samuel L. Jackson is particularly outstanding. I liked Maria de Madeiros also as Bruce Willis' wife Fabienne. The camera work is occasionally interesting, as the long scene where we watch Bruce Willis listen unemotionally to Marsellus go on. Interesting, certainly, but rather pointless.Indeed, that's the problem: so much of what goes on is pointless. It's a big long shaggy dog story, told by one of those irritating people who can't get the story straight and have to keep going back: ""Oh yeah, I forgot to tell you about that. Well, you know what I was telling you before . . ."" I tried to find some justification for the higgledy-piggledy way in which this story is told. It does result in the best scene being the last one. But if this scene was the point then why not design the script so that the action is seen to be moving toward this goal and cut out everything that happens afterward? In the end I don't think Tarentino knew what story he was telling and that's why so much is so pointless.The scenes of Butch attempting to control his temper, of his dilemma whether to help Marsellus, and the final scene in the restaurant are all good and entertaining as far as they go but they don't fall into a coherent framework. And the rest is quite dull.The dialogue is not witty or clever although it occasionally has its moments. The constant profanity is as pointless as the rest; the point of profanity is presumably to emphasize what one is saying, but if everything is emphasized, nothing is. The mind becomes numbed by it. It's like someone who shouts all the time. Eventually you stop listening. The quotes give you a pretty good idea of what the dialogue is like: when ""Shut the f*ck up, fat man!"" is listed as a memorable quote, you know how inane the conversation is.That this poorly composed script should have won an Oscar is a pretty clear indictment of the Academy."
"4002","Pulp Fiction",10,"Ah, so by that rationale, if a pig had a better personality, he would cease to be a filthy animal. Is that true?","It kind of feels redundant trying to write a review for Pulp Fiction as it approaches its 20th birthday. As a film it needs no introduction, it won the Palme d'Or at Cannes, won a BAFTA and Academy Award for Best Original Screenplay (Tarantino), and garnered a whole host of other awards and nominations. Box office beef was meaty and its reputation even now shows no sign of waning (it currently sits at number 4 on the IMDb top 100 list), it is by definition one cool MOFO of a movie, a picture loved by a cross section of demographics. But why?Pulp Fiction oozes humour, romance, violence and stylish flourishes. It remains compulsive viewing throughout; even as it threatens to get submerged in its own complex structure. Film lover Tarantino takes a number of low life and unfortunate characters from Los Angeles, mainlines then with movie clichés, and then amazingly breathes new life into them. It knowingly winks at B movies from the past yet always remains fresh on its own terms. I myself having just revisited the film after a 5 year gap can attest to just how well it holds up, laughing at the dialogue, perched on the edge of the seat as violence starts to rumble, and yes, singing along with that most catchy of soundtracks.Yet for all its flashiness and hipster chattering, there's one thing that often gets overlooked when talk of Pulp Fiction's greatness arises. That of a basic human urge to survive or find salvation, Tarantino's main characters may be bottom feeders or scummy operatives of the underworld, but there's love and needing beating slowly in its dark heart before the drugs and violence take a hold. Neat trick that from Tarantino, brilliant in fact. 10/10"
"4003","Pulp Fiction",8,"Fun cult film, tad overrated","Conflicted on this one. I like a lot of elements of it, the characters are (mostly) really compelling and interesting. I think some of the ""Segments"" are a lot stronger than others. I think that the first part of Bruce Willis's story is just... bland. I didn't find it very interesting or compelling. It gets interesting though. The first and last are by far my favourite, but for the most part it's pretty strong. I do think this film is slightly overrated. That's not to say that it isn't good, but I think a lot of people think it is a whole lot better then it is. The film is acted well and I enjoyed all the action, not to mention the comedy in this film caught me by surprise. I found it really hilarious. I see why everyone had/has a crush on Uma Thurman now, she really is deserving of the main character on the cover. I also remembered how much I like long shots. I think they allow exposition to be delivered in a way that is more pleasing to the audience. Overall, good crime flick with some great comedy and action but a tad overrated. 7-8/10."
"4004","Pulp Fiction",1,"Talk Fiction. Overrated and overpraised disappointment","I will never understand why Pulp Fiction is hailed by so many as one of the greatest films ever made. Quentin Tarintino's first film Reservoir Dogs was amazing. It had excellent performances, some good action scenes, an impressive structure and fantastic sound track. When Pulp Fiction came out in my country in October 1994, i could not wait to see it. Empire Magazine gave it 5 stars. I remember when i went up to Glasgow to see it with an anticipation i had not felt since i had went to see some thing like Star Wars or Indiana Jones.Oh boy, twenty minutes in and i was already sick to death of Samuel Jackson's character. He just talked and talked and talked and....talked. John Travolta's Vince Vega was a guy i wanted to decimate, oh Travolta you looked ridiculous with those hair extensions and then you talked and talked and talked with Uma Thurman in a silly black wig. There was so much talking in this film that it made me want to walk out. I have only ever done this once in my life and it was with that utter garbage Jack Nicholson flick Wolf. Tosh.So i kept hoping that something good would happen...Christopher Walken as an army bloke talking and talking about a gold watch up his ass...NOT GOOD...a male rape scene with talk...NOT GOOD...Quentin Tarintino turning up in a cameo that should have got him shot (in real life) talk talk about disposing of bodies...oh, this film was the pits, i must have been the only one in the audience that hated this film, because everyone was whooping and hollering like they were watching a Naked Gun comedy. Oh yes, they loved it.Quiet frankly my admiration of Tarintino was gone forever, he got his head together with the brilliant Jackie Brown then lost the plot again with the silly Kill Bill volumes. Pulp Fiction is one of the worst movies I've ever had to endure, its a long boring ride to a sore head."
"4005","Pulp Fiction",7,"A good movie, but not a great movie","Pulp Fiction is a good, well-acted movie that is way, way, way over hyped by its fans. The core of the movie, the blathering of Vincent and Jules is fun and enjoyable. Bruce Willis as a hot-headed boxer does an excellent job communicating his fear and desperation. In the end, the movie's quirks and twists are merely to make a rather run-of-the-mill arthouse film seem more edgy. There is no question that this is a well made and fun movie. However it is not the amazing Second Coming of Christ as many Tarantinophiles would have us all believing. Many of the components are merely there to make us, the audience, gasp in horror or gaze in amazement. Do we REALLY need to watch John Travolta stick a needle in Uma Thurmond?  Yeah, sure it was cool at the time but that coolness quickly wears off when you realize there is really nothing likeable about any of these people."
"4006","Pulp Fiction",1,"A creative and slick waste of time","You want to do something really neat? Take the movie ""Pulp Fiction"" and re-cut it, so that, instead of being out of sequence, it is actually in proper sequence. It can be done. Why do this? Because if you do, you will see what a nothing movie this really is. There is no central plot, there is no real theme, or story or climax. It is just a bunch of tricks and overly snappy dialog, masquerading a piece of fluff that has as much depth as the kiddie pool. Hey, more power to Tarantino, the guy is a Houdini, full of slight of hand. But are we really so simple, that we are ranking this one of the ten greatest movies ever made? Come on! OK, I know that Travolta is cool and Jackson is funny. However, let's reserve the greatest films of all-time category for real masterpieces and real stories, and not some overly slick pulp geared towards video store geeks."
"4007","Bad Boys for Life",1,"Boring and Predictable","This is one of those sequels which we did not need.
A bunch of endless shooting, unnecessary chases, senseless action. This is all there is to this movie. The acting is boring, the writing is horrible and story is even worse. It is heartbreaking to see that this movie has a rating of 7. It is an insult to cinema.
Save your time and money. STAY AWAY from bad boys FOR LIFE!!!"
"4008","Bad Boys for Life",4,"Bad Boys Derailed","I never thought I would say this...but I wish Michael Bay had directed this. Maybe the earlier entries hold something dear to his heart and he wouldn't have allowed this to go off the rails.The biggest casualty is the riffing between the Lawrence and Smith, which practically rips the soul right out of the franchise. The laughs from the first two movies came from the strong chemistry between the two leads and how they could argue in the middle of gun fights, car chases, etc. Here they just sound like an old married couple who have grown tired of each other.The other casualty is the action scenes. The great Sam Peckinpah once said of the violence in his films that he wanted the audience to feel the impact of getting shot. Modern day use of CGI and such does the exact opposite. It feels more like you're watching somebody else play a video game. While some praise the visuals, I criticize its effect of pushing the viewer further away rather than drawing them in.This could have been like Lethal Weapon IV and had some fun with its theme of the loose cannon dealing with aging. Instead its more like Beverly Hills Cop III and becomes a sad entry in an otherwise solid franchise."
"4009","Bad Boys for Life",1,"Who writes this crap","A terrible movie.
Script horrible! Numerous goofs! Did they get paid for this? Not even entertaining. No acting....just fooling around. Plot? Copied and predictable. I'm nauseated."
"4010","Bad Boys for Life",1,"10's..Really?? Insult to the 1st two movies.","I love these films and this is nowhere close to the 1st two. It doesnt even feel like a BB's movie. Its sluggish unfunny with a tv movie feel about it.
The chemistry between Will Smith and Martin Lawrence is not there as nearly every joke is flat and feels like its trying REAL hard. The original cast just looks tired and in most scenes it feels it. Its a darker movie that drowns in despair for large part of the film and Smith and Lawrence dont have the comedy sparring of old to balance it out.
Believe me this is not a 10, its barely a 4.
For me its BB's 1 and 2 and thats when it ended. Sadly"
"4011","Bad Boys for Life",1,"Bad movie for life","Bad boys for life was shot over the weekend by a group of special needs high school sophomores. No need to worry that you are missing the plot because there isn't one."
"4012","Bad Boys for Life",1,"Bad script, overdone jokes and cheap CGI","Very cheap CGI and very bad acting coming from Lawrence ruined 2 hours of my life. I really need to forget this dumb movie.
Probably likable to people with lack of good taste."
"4013","Bad Boys for Life",1,"No energy","Two old men, the energy is not the same. It was boring right from the start and using cheap cgi made it even worser."
"4014","Bad Boys for Life",8,"Walked in with low expectation, walked out satisfied.","Will Smith and Martin Lawrence steal the show with other talented actors and some eye candy along the way with good budget action. I cant give away too much but this movie was great and lived up to the hype of Bad Boys 1 and 2 respectively."
"4015","Bad Boys for Life",1,"Terrible terrible movie","I can't remember the last time I saw a movie this bad in the theatre. I didn't smile once. Bad humor. Lawrence has never been funny and now he's so old and fat, he can barely move. Watch as they cut away every time he takes more than four steps; probably because he was out of breath. Smith is as usual Smith but he can't do anything with the 4th grade script. The action scenes are boring and stupid. Any rational adult claiming to line this should be ashamed and embarrassed. For the knuckle dragging Fast and Furious fans only. What an abomination."
"4016","Bad Boys for Life",8,"Typical Bad Boys Movie","Lots of action, little plot twist and a setup for maybe another? I liked it. Will Smith's character Mike seemed a bit overdone but Martin Lawrence was as funny as usual."
"4017","Bad Boys for Life",2,"I MADE AN ACCOUNT JUST FOR THIS","Where do I start?!?I felt like I was watching a new fast and furious movie for 80% of it. The writing is among the worst I've ever seen. Total shambles and I am very surprised Will Smith and Martin Lawrence would agree to make this movie.The plot was dreadful and the delivery not much better.I am completely baffled by the good reviews this movie is receiving.Being how much I hold the first 2 movies in high regard (especially number 1). This one absolutely tarnishes its legacy for me. If you are a big fan of the first 2 then don't expect anything like that with this one.I give it a 2 stars for the few bits of humour and nostalgia the movie had. I don't recall ever being more disappointed with a sequel."
"4018","Bad Boys for Life",2,"Realy Bad Bad Boys","Just Bad , like realy bad, like realy realy bad. Bad story, bad directing compared with realy bad jokes."
"4019","Bad Boys for Life",8,"Another fun and possibly final chapter","Going back to the roots of the first film and cutting down the lengthy action scenes this film relies on probably the best story line of the franchise and as usual Martin Lawrence steeling the scenes and laughs. The new blood in the form of Alexander Ludwig, Vanessa Hudgens and Charles Melton really freshens things up.
Laughs, action and bad boys for life."
"4020","Bad Boys for Life",8,"Ignore the low scores this is a solid action comedy.","I came to this movie with very low expectations, and I was pleasantly surprised..I enjoyed it throughout...the boys rekindled the magic...they still got it...it was hilarious at times...fast paced and still had the feel of a bad boys movie.Overall it was better then expected an a great solid action comedy for a Sunday evening..."
"4021","Bad Boys for Life",7,"Mike Lowwwry","It wasn't bad, I like the fast pace action and the banter between Smith and Lawrence, I did however think the Cartel storyline was a little over the top. The supporting cast was good though however and overall it was an entertaining film."
"4022","Bad Boys for Life",7,"Not too old for that ...","I'm not sure I can finish the quote on imdb. Swearing and all that. But that aside and not even close to comparing this to the Lethal Weapon franchise, the next entry into the Bad Boys series is here. Many have been waiting for this for a long time. Not sure why that was (many speculations about that), but let's just enjoy that it is here.It also feels like both Martin and Will never left ... the roles. It feels like they are those guys. Maybe some parts of them do match to their personality, who knows? Having said that, the movie is quite predictable, but also quite fun overall. I cannot be mad at some of the flaws and the convinient timing of certain events. Nor the added relationships and backstories that might feel detached to a degree. If you can just watch it, without thinking too much, it'll be ok. But I reckon it is time to rewatch the first two movies again ... (4 Life though? Shouldn't they have waited to use that for a sure to come part 4? I mean come on!)"
"4023","Bad Boys for Life",9,"Great Rival to the franchise","Bad boys for life was such a great movie from start to finish this movie was so funny had great action scenes while it had a quite a few emotional scenes will Smith & Martin Lawrence great as always bounced of each other the new edition's too the cast was great they really added something fresh to the movie. Overall this movie was a kick ass rival the the franchise filled with great humour and badass action scenes"
"4024","Bad Boys for Life",9,"Loved it from start to finish","Ok...so yea it's never going to be as good as the second one. However, I feel it's better than the first and the story holds well. Good action scenes, few emotional scenes and of course the comedy of these two together. It's a bad boys movie! Easy watching and fun!"
"4025","Bad Boys for Life",9,"Where is cake boy?","The movie was brilliant, but they should've kept Thomas 'the Cake Boy' in the party scene."
"4026","Bad Boys for Life",9,"Really surprised","Though for the most part I enjoy the bad boys movies they never really had real character stakes and interesting villains and this one really gives a lot of surprises! The villains are interesting, the jokes land for the most part and you really feel for the characters this time around. I hope they don't bring Micheal bay back for the 4th one."
"4027","Bad Boys for Life",1,"The clue is in the title.","Bad acting, worse jokes, terrible script.
Martins acting was so cringy, i felt like punching myself."
"4028","Bad Boys for Life",9,"Way better than expected","This movie had a variety of greatness to it. The storyline was awesome and seeing old characters from the other movie as well as good comedy, action and emotion. Everything you could want from a bad boys movie. I enjoyed it"
"4029","Bad Boys for Life",8,"Nothing to hate","I did see this when it was out , and there were enough jokes and gun shots to get me through the story ,and i just had a rewatch while , showing more about both the characters , which is done very thoughtfully,as a cop from the 90s would become, and the addition of the new team makes complete senese , surely some jokes did not work , and with it's own set of nit pickings aside , this film carries more than just the nostalgia from the former two"
"4030","Bad Boys for Life",9,"Great Action Movie","I haven't seen the first two bad boys movies, but this new one was much better than expected, and I enjoyed every second of it. Definitely a recommendation to any action fans."
"4031","Bad Boys for Life",9,"Bad boys for life","Amzing move value for money. Action comedy story no comment on them well done so far best move in 2020"
"4032","The Hater",8,"Fake news nihilism with shades of psychosis...","Fake news nihilism with shades of psychosis - you need a few things to go your way, but if they do, and you have the tools of technology, then any amount of chaos can ensue and who knows what political outcomes might develop, there's certainly a few questionable one's around at the moment.Refreshingly original, relevant and soon to be copied."
"4033","The Hater",9,"An Anti-Hero, An Eye-opener. A Masterpiece","Tomasz is anti-hero you can't mess with. It is a manipulative, thrilling and a complex movie that matches our current environment. Tackles society and politics on how bleak it is. This film indeed a compelling movie from the trailer to the film itself. The team did a smart approach on telling how social media manipulates people. It is convincing but at some point but a tragic one. This movie proves how man can possess power using just a laptop. This is like a modern ""Lord of the Flies"" story that need more viewing and deserves more audiences. Consider this a masterpieceI like how the cinematic toning is done. It has same technique and atmosphere as David Fincher's film. The tension matches the music."
"4034","The Hater",8,"Feeling Komasa great style","After Oscar nominated Corpus Christi, we receive continuation of Suicide room. I called that movie body ,,Polish Parasite''. The screenplay is original, leading actor is great, Agata Kulesza, as always delivers another remarkable performance. The subject of hate on the Internet and amongst people is very current/matches our crazy times of Internet addiction. Highly recommended."
"4035","The Hater",8,"Intelligent, free-thinking. Deserves watching.","A film with intelligence, remarkably devoid of simplification in its social and political portrayal of our cold, ruthless world of postmodern haves and have-nots. The distant but all the more biting satire (or is that the right word?) of Poland's new urban bourgeoisie is very effective. Also one of the few recent films able to capture young people's permanent online emotional handicap."
"4036","The Hater",10,"Masterpiece","JAN KOMASA STRIKES AGAIN!!!! The 38 years old Polish Director of CORPUS CHRISTI returned this Spring with a MASTERPIECE, ""THE HATER"", a movie which is the creation of a genius. The brilliance of the story, of the actors, very young, as young and talented as their Director, of the camera, of the image, the Poetry of this wonderfully done movie renders us speechless. CONGRATULATIONS, Poland!!!"
"4037","The Hater",8,"Oscar material","This is a true masterpiece about several important contemporary issues. It is an amazing story showing how a psychopath could manipulate rise of populism and online trolling to fulfill his own agenda. There is also an element of underlying class conflict. I decided to watch this on Netflix because of many positive reviews on IMDB and I was not disappointed at all. Every aspect of this movie is excellent. Especially the acting skills of the actor playing the main character are a treat to watch. Highly recommended."
"4038","The Hater",8,"Poignant and timely examination of Hate we Get and Give","The Hater - A- (Almost Perfect)An important movie, which exams Scio/Psychopathic behaviour in youth along with sides effects of social media presence in backdrops of political unrest in the world. This seems a lot to handle in one film, but Jan Komasa masterfully handled these subject matters. The film never felt overburden by the issues it tries to examine.Maciej Musialowski has given a star making performance as Tomasz. For viewers to understand his motives and even to sympathise due to pressures on youth in today's climate is an astounding feat of its own. The cast across the board is fantastic and as it was released on Netflix in Australia and I went in without knowing anything or watching any promos I was at an absolute awe of the movie.This should shed light on our own behaviour of Hate we give through commenting and arguing with strangers online, and Hate we Receive for sharing our thoughts on issues important to us. Highly Recommended."
"4039","The Hater",8,"Komasa strikes again!","An impressive psychopathic thriller, Komasa's sequel to his debut ""Suicide Room"" marks a new goal in his fabulous career. Fresh from his Oscar nod, the young Polish director paints an accurate portrait of Millennials through the story of a social media expert who uses his ability to create a net of fascism and hate, targeting artists, politicians and some of his close friends. Brilliantly acted and photographed, it deserves all attention it can gets and should be named one of this year's most accomplished films."
"4040","The Hater",9,"Hatred comes alive","I almost stop in the middle of the movie because I can't stand watching the atmosphere of hatred in it. I don't know that you could portray hatred in such a ""disgusting"" way, and by that I mean it's so great. I feel that there are two main actors, the hater and his hatred. It comes alive. The actor is fascinating as well. And it's relevant with today's situation, so bravo!"
"4041","The Hater",9,"excellent movie","Great acting from the main character and deals with many issues , racism, social media, youth.
I really enjoy it! pretty dark movie."
"4042","The Hater",9,"Quite Good","This film is timely, well acted, creates an eerie dark atmosphere and is well written and directed. Very interesting plot that fits in well with today's sick world of social media and what goes on behind closed doors. Also shows an interesting portrayal of a sociopath. A few minor plot holes, but overall quite enjoyable."
"4043","The Hater",9,"An empty portrait of current and future society.","There are few movies like this. Of those films that tell a truth in disguise, although we all know that it is more true than fiction. The film presents all those inconveniences that derive from social networks, as well as their negative impact on human relationships. Similarly, how technology plays a crucial role in the events that happen in the world. The soundtrack was spectacular, as were the main actors. The photographic effects used show a cold and gray Poland, which combines very well with that feeling of emptiness that the main protagonists have. Thomas Giemza and Gabi Krasucka represent the emptiness of two young people who go through life full of misery, loneliness, etc. This movie is not about heroes, not even a ""development"" of evil in Tomasz. There are no fair winners, as everyone advocates evil on certain occasions. The film is not perfect, of course. There are certain data that we do not know, such as the death of Tomasz's mother and why the Krasucki passed him money for his studies, but they are data that the director knows how to handle well and leaves it to the viewer. Anyway, I think it is an excellent movie. It can be seen easily, even if you don't expect ""winners"" or happy endings. It is a film that presents the human being in its greatest splendor, without hesitation."
"4044","The Hater",8,"Nasty new anti-hero in troubling times","Tomasz is a new kind of unsettling villain drawn to logical extremes in a post-truth world. Some may say it loses believability early on. They are probably the same people who laughed at the possibility of Donald Trump becoming president and that a nasty little virus would become a world changing pandemic."
"4045","The Hater",9,"Hated To Love It...Or Loved To Hate It...?","Just finished watching this and am now determined to see everything by Jan Komasa. Netflix have found a finely cut gem, far better than their normal offerings.This will be brief; The protagonist is a cool, calculating, utterly ruthless psychopath, but not at first. He grows into the role with a disturbingly natural ease that pulls you in. Tomasz (Maciej Musialowski) is totally convincing and dare I say far more plausible than Christian Bale's American Psychopath? There, I've said it.He is everything that is wrong with the world, and yet by the end of a thrilling film we're left in no doubt that he has a bright future ahead of him. Politics maybe? He'd certainly get elected, no matter what it took.The writer, Mateusz Pacewicz, must be playing with the idea of a sequel? I wouldn't begrudge him the effort. Maybe a social media campaign to nudge him in the right direction is in order?The 2+ hours flew by, helped by a mainly classical score that kind of underwrites Warsaw's long, proud and sometimes violent history. Nothing seemed out of place. It's definitely the kind of film I can watch a few times, and I'm very fussy.Don't watch this with Grandma, but do watch it, highly recommended."
"4046","The Hater",9,"Taut social engineered scaffolding of outrage.","At times this is extremely difficult to watch. So many Euro/Global points of tension it feels like every inflammatory subject has been distilled into shot glasses and you are so messed up you can't refuse to play the game. Things could get real ugly.Excellent acting manages to deal much of the anguish in such a terrifying poker face is catches you entirely off guard. I had no idea what to expect when getting into this film. It began with a typical character construct along a linear timeline, but very rapidly violated my low expectations and had me utterly terrified. And much sooner than its pacing really picked up.I speak primarily of the sharp attention drawn towards personal privacy and cybersecurity. There's elements of Mr. Robot here but don't stay too attached to that thought. Equally well researched. Refreshingly an entirely different scope. Politically charged nearly to the point of feeling sweaty. Modern day warfare - annihalating reputations in its path.A multifaceted lead whose intentions are not initially obvious but you can absolutely taste his hurt at every squeeze. The way he flips from boyish charm to an ice-cold, heart felt bitter snarl, well it could easily suck all the air out of the room.It's a gripping tale. Builds like a violently brutalist skyscraper."
"4047","The Hater",7,"Imagine the Godfather meets Parasite but everyone is attractive and Polish. Deliciously twisted.","It scared me. Be prepared to get slightly paranoid afterwards...I am honestly still unsure what the message of the movie was:
Was it that these companies exist and we should proceed with caution with all information posted on Facebook?Or was it that there are very intelligent sociopaths out there who if you're unfortunate will destroy your life?Maybe it simply wanted to demonstrate that if you work hard enough, don't care about values/limits or anyone you'll get everything you wanted?Regarding the plot: There were some weaknesses in the beginning, I guess. The whole setting and everything seemed weird. However, after finishing the movie I assume it was meant to feel that way for a viewer. I am just pointing this out because one of my friends left, in the beginning while we watched it. It is somewhat sad, because the acting is great, the plotting is nicely played and the plot twists are on point. The only thing that I am irritated by is the last scene with his boss, because I would have expected from her to have bugs in her room which she maybe could activate by tapping somewhere on her table - as her security net. A recording of that conversation would have ruined his show... Oh well, overall a well done critic of our modern society!"
"4048","The Hater",8,"Enlightening, the best is the message","In the contemporary world a milennial with a computer at his fingertips can wreak havoc in politics and personal lifes, and the damage can be worse if he is frustated with his current personal life, emotionally depressed and serving dark economic interests. Political Ideology is not a matter of commitment to one thoughts everything can be technically managed behind a corporate selfish screen."
"4049","The Hater",NA,"Sidney Lumet would have loved this one.","Only a few minutes after watching this film, I thought about Sid Lumet's atmosphere and topics all over the years. Of course, it was decades ago, Internet did not exist yet, but the NY director could have given us such a complex, brilliant analysis of the cruel and modern world, a world of manipulation and cynism, a world of ruthlessness and ambition where no matter the means, only the results count. Not for all audiences though being too intellectual. The perfect kind of feature that makes you think long after viewing. I prefer watching such a movie instead a Christopher Nolan's one. Very disturbing."
"4050","The Hater",9,"What would you do to achieve what you set out to do?","A Polish drama.
It is about a boy who is expelled from law school for plagiarizing an essay and is hired in a discrediting internship on social networks and the Internet, while harassing a girl along with his family.

It is a movie that goes at its own pace.
He talks about politics and its unfair management, public opinion, the world on the internet, the misuse of networks, xebophobia, inclusion, the management of weak minds, identification, hatred, achieving what one does. proposer, in some cases.
The profile of the leading character (Tokem) is really interesting.
The few sequels of action are well accomplished.
Who can be able to trample in order to achieve what you want? That shows the movie."
"4051","The Hater",9,"Very Good.","Tomasz is just introduced to the audience as rather a desperate young man. At the start he is being thrown out of law school for plagiarism. We then meet with the liberal elite family that may be paying his way in. They truly seem to dislike Tomasz and make fun of him. Tomasz knows this because he spys on them by leaving his phone behind. Eventually Tomasz gets involved with a PR company that uses, lets just say, *out of the box* techniques and Tomasz uses this to enact revenge on ""the world"" and the family who treated him so poorly.I am not capturing it well but this was one of the best movies I have seen in a while and it really opened my mind to the way the internet can be manipulated for nefarious purposes."
"4052","The Hater",7,"Slow paced but could keep my attention","Nice film about someone plotting and deceiving his way to a better life. You keep wondering what he'll do and how far he will go. Not too political even though the people in the film have strong political opinions the film never hits you over the head what the ""correct"" way is."
"4053","The Hater",5,"Confused with the great reviews","After an hour I wanted to give up but also needed to see what happened so stuck with it. It's a slow burn and I was confused for a lot of the movie on what exactly the point was. There are some unanswered questions about his family and previous life.
The last 20 minutes were more thrilling. But the lack of dialogue and not much going on for most of the movie isn't worth it."
"4054","The Hater",NA,"Tomasz rises to the ocasion","There are people who control things - I don't just mean leaders, politicians, financiers - I mean those whom you meet only to become swept into their agenda without realising it.The majority of us ride the waves of life in a state of perpetual discovery, but the controllers know what buttons to press, what emotional strings to pull, what manipulations will work. They ply their orchestrations without conscience, regret, or even a fleeting care for those they touch, even if their charm seems to say otherwise.These devious people destroy to gain their objectives, often without fear. They lie and cheat without a moment's hesitation, but you have no idea until it's too late.To say they lack empathy is only to scratch the surface. Beneath that glib charisma seethes a monster, hell bent on promotion, wealth, prestige, domination, who will use all their dark arts to achieve it.In this well crafted piece, Tomasz is quick to learn that small deceptions are spotted straight away, but the big lies, the sweeping gestures, the devious plays in plain sight go undetected. In a world where information is power, the rising star gathers much currency for use now and in the future.Watch and learn. Try hard to not be one of those who are swept along by such people. Don't let them direct your actions, be the one who says no; the one who maintains their own integrity."

"4058","Three Billboards Outside Ebbing, Missouri",9,"A thought-provoking and darkly comedic drama with lots to say.","""Three Billboards outside Ebbing, Missouri"" marks a milestone for writer/directer Martin McDonagh and is an idea piece on a mother's struggle with her town after posting billboards containing a call to action in regards to her murdered daughter. With outstanding screen writing and near perfect editing, this powerhouse of a film is easily one of the best all year and is driven with force and intensity by its lead, Frances McDormand.What begins as a narrow and focused drama, gradually escalates to a film with big themes and ideas, relevant social commentary, and much more subplots than anticipated. ""Three Billboards outside Ebbing, Missouri"" is packed with questions and a few answers about anger, revenge, violence, and kindness. The story shows people in a realistic light I've never quite seen before. We're presented with characters and their genuine emotions. Nothing feels sugarcoated of fluffed but it never lacks emotional impact either. The movie balances its seemingly contradictory tones beautifully by crafting a dark comedy that feels heavy due to strong subject matter, while at the same time, utilizing comedic moments that feel completely natural to the character's motivations. It's obvious great care was taken into this script and the method in which it's constructed. One of the most talked about elements to this film are the strong performances; particularly by Frances McDormand and Sam Rockwell. Rightfully so, this is some of their best (if not their best) work these eyes have beheld and they steal the show in every film they're in. That's not take away from Woody Harrelson and Lucas Hedges, as well as the entire cast who give memorable performances and paint shockingly believable characters that we feel we know personally. If there is anything that might turn audiences away from this film, it might be its harsh subject matter despite none of it every being depicted as well as its language and execution with the material. Personally, this has a strong impact and I wouldn't have changed anything about it. It's a highly recommended film with a lot to ponder at the end and is definitely a contender for best movie of the year. Definitely don't miss this one."
"4059","Three Billboards Outside Ebbing, Missouri",9,"Anger, what it begets, and what to do about it","When you think about great cinema, you often imagine some grandiose epic setting which all that greatness builds upon. The likes of Gone With the Wind or Godfather or The Shawshank Redemption, such films span through decades or cover the major historic events.But a great story isn't necessary grand on the outside. Three Billboards Outside Ebbing, Missouri is like a tiny rabbit hole size of those three wooden screens, but stick a head in - and you'll see a huge empty space laid with people's sorrow, guilt and regret. And that emptiness sucks you in and leaves no way to stay untouched.But there's also hope. Hope for justice. Hope for retribution. And maybe even hope that it's still not too late to change something, or to change yourself. That nothing is absolutely black and white. That even in the darkest moments of our lives there's some room for a sense of humor, maybe a sad and bitter one but still one worth a warm smile.This world is a crooked place, where crime often goes unpunished. And Peter Dinklage's small role in this film, as a reference to another not so pretty world where the ""happily ever after"" way doesn't quite exist, is a stinging reminder of that. TBOEM does not, however, try to pull the magic sword out of the stone and go crush the wicked and protect the righteous. Instead, it shows that sometimes, crumbling under the weight of the evil things that fall on us, we lose our own limits and become those who sow evil ourselves. Anger does beget even more anger.And maybe the reason that makes America great indeed is that, with all the messed up stuff happening without and within, it's in your culture to value forgiveness, something Christianity teaches everyone but not everyone tends to listen. To suffer without guilt, yet to offer a helping hand to your offender when he's down and wounded. To break the circle of evil and help each other wake that yearning for decency that everyone has inside them, albeit dormant sometimes. Forgiveness is tough, and, just like revenge, it doesn't bring back the things - or people - we've lost. But at least it helps to hold onto what could still be here.Yeah, it's just a movie, and most people aren't as deep and philosophical as the movie characters can afford to be. But if some unrealistic complexity (and sometimes even wisdom) of the simple people could make some real regular people on the other side of the screen stop and think over their own real regular ways, maybe that's exactly what we need from time to time. Because life is still here, and so are the multiple choices it gives, And which road to choose today, we can still decide along the way."
"4060","Three Billboards Outside Ebbing, Missouri",10,"A comedic masterpiece with a stellar leading performance from Frances McDormand.","Three Billboards Outside Ebbing, Missouri is a dark comedy that has an a-list cast with names like Frances McDormand, Woody Harrelson, Sam Rockwell, John Hawkes, and Peter Dinklage. It centers around Mildred Hayes, a woman whose daughter was raped and killed, and who believes that the local police have not done enough about it. In reaction, she erects three billboards outside of her town that send a message to the sheriff about the state of the investigation.Writer/director Martin McDonagh (Seven Psychopaths, In Bruges) has outdone himself with this one. In my opinion, if this isn't one of the top Oscar contenders come awards season, then Hollywood has officially lost its mind.Basically everything about this film works: from the acting, to the writing, to the direction. Mcdormand gives the performance of her career here, giving us humor through all the pain clearly shown on her face. Rockwell also gives his best performance here as a cop who isn't that bright and is more than a little racist. Three Billboards Outside Ebbing, Missouri is probably the most unpredictable film of the year, and that's coming from a year that includes films like Baby Driver and Logan. There are scenes where you think that you know where the plot is going, but then midway through it completely flips the script. For the entire run-time of this film, I was invested. It has the perfect run-time; it ends exactly when it needs to and there is not a scene that feels out of place. It seems like one of the hardest things to do in film nowadays is to balance comedy and drama. However, this movie does it effortlessly. Each scene has just the right amount of comedy and drama, and sometimes, despite the fact that you're laughing, it's easy to forget that jokes are being made.Also, the message that this film gives off resonates very powerfully with you after the film finishes. It makes you see the good side in humanity, despite our flaws. No character in this film is a cliché one-dimensional shell of a person. Everybody has a reason for being there, which is more than some films recently have offered.Three Billboards Outside Ebbing, Missouri is easily one of the best and most enjoyable films of 2017, and it will make you laugh, cry, and think all in one sitting. There are not any clear flaws with this film that I can find, but I am still searching.I give Three Billboards Outside Ebbing, Missouri an A+."
"4061","Three Billboards Outside Ebbing, Missouri",9,"A dark, twisted comedy about grief, tragedy and three billboards","Having recently won the People's Choice Awards at TIFF, Three Billboards outside Ebbing, Missouri is very easy to see why it won.Three Billboards is a dark but also funny and heart-felt story about one woman's quest to get justice for her daughter's rape and murder. After Mildred Haynes buys three billboards with words written on them accusing the town's well-liked sheriff of having not found her daughter's killer, it sets a series of events that turns the citizens and the cops against her.The thing I can say about Three Billboards without going into spoilers is that it is wildly unpredictable. One moment you think things are going one direction as expected then it takes hard left turn that only adds to the dynamic between the characters. As the pressure within the town builds and anger is pointed towards Mildred, we see many of these characters evolve in order to deal with tragedy and grief and learn to find peace. And the movie goes through a roller-coaster of emotions. One moment you are laughing your butt off from the hilarious dialogue then you feel like someone just punched you in the gut. With every victory you think this story brings you feel like it was taken away from because of the world's unfairness and injustice. In lesser hands the mixture of dark and comedic tones would not work, but director and writer Martin McDonagh knows how to balance them to perfection.The performances here just through the roof. Frances McDormand delivers a performance that will for sure get her into the Lead Actress awards race at the Oscars. As Mildred, McDormand just cuts loose with her performance with every line of hate, cynicism and cursing towards everyone she feels doesn't truly understand the internal pain she is going through. But McDormand does now and then show a soft side to Mildred. It shows that Mildred is just person like everyone who has her own way of dealing with the tragedy of loosing her own child. And Sam Rockwell also gives one of the best performances of his career as the flawed and very misguided cop Dixon. The character of Dixon is short-tempered, volatile, and not bright with some baggage of his own that the locals accuse him of. But Sam Rockwell brings his charm and sincerity to what could be a rather unlikable character. And in the latter half, you see Dixon go through a tremendous arc of learning to care about others rather then just being angry towards them. Other great performances that should be called out are Woody Harrelson, Peter Dinklage, John Hawk and Caleb Landry Jones.Three Billboards outside Ebbing, Missouri is easily one of the best movies this year and is worth seeing once it comes out in wide releases."
"4062","Three Billboards Outside Ebbing, Missouri",8,"Anger begets more anger","Frances McDormand is a grieving mother who puts up ""Three Billboards Outside of Ebbing, Missouri"" in this 2017 black comedy directed by Martin McDonagh.Mildred Hayes (McDormand) is disgusted that the police haven't found her daughter's rapist and killer, so she takes out billboards asking why the chief of police, Willoughby (Woody Harrelson) hasn't done anything about the case.The billboards set off anger, violence, and revenge motifs in this small town. Things become worse when a pent-up police officer, Dixon (Sam Rockwell) becomes enraged and starts acting out.Lots of swearing, lots of violence, and lots of laughs to be had in this film. It was strange to watch as I had just seen another film, Past Life, that focused on the subject of anger and pain, and how it can eat a person up and destroy them. This film is yet another good illustration of that, as Mildred stops at nothing to make a point.The one-liners are amazing, and Mildred's speech to the priest who comes by to ask her to remove the billboards is hilarious. The movie is filled with strong performances and equally well-developed characters. We see all of their sides - violent, kind, vengeful, angry, sad; we finally realize they're just people driven in some cases to extremes.Harrelson's performance is touching -- we're prepared to dislike him but his sincerity and humanity come through. As Dixon, Rockwell seems like a monster, but once he acts out, he's able to focus his energy a little better.And then there's McDormand, a powerhouse. She's not good ol' Marge in Fargo. She's a tough woman with a broken heart who takes out her anger any way she can. It's a beautiful, multilayered performance. Highly recommended, asking the questions of where revenge and hatred can take us, and deciding when and if it stops."
"4063","Three Billboards Outside Ebbing, Missouri",9,"Extremely funny film about grief, anger, revenge and violence","It seemed that the pregnant police detective Marge Gunderson from 'Fargo' would forever be the most memorable character of Frances McDormand's acting career. But now I'm not so sure. Mildred Hayes, the heroine from 'Three Billboards', is a serious contender. This might well be her best performance ever.The part of Mildred Hayes was written with McDormand in mind. Hayes is a divorced single mother, living with her son on the outskirts of a small, remote town. She had a daughter too, but the girl was raped and killed on a quiet mountain road not far from home. Frustrated by the lack of progress of the investigation, Hayes decides to rent three dilapidated billboards, publicly accusing the local police chief of incompetence. By doing so, she attracts the attention of the media, angers almost the entire town and causes a succession of increasingly violent actions.Although the film is about grief, anger, revenge and violence, it is extremely funny. Above all because of Mildred Hayes' stubborn character and her ability to verbally humiliate people by her extremely sharp tongue. The monologue she delivers when a priest visits her house to tell her she has gone too far, is priceless.Apart from McDormand's performance, the screenplay is another great feature of this film. The story is full of unexpected twists, gradually shifting the positions of the main characters towards each other. None of the characters are one-dimensional: they all reveal surprising parts of their personalities as the story moves forward.And then there is the overall, almost Coen-esque atmosphere of a small town full of colourful characters. There is a racist cop, a friendly midget, a smart advertising guy and a pretty girl who is so dumb she doesn't know the difference between polo and polio.It is hard to mention something negative about this film. 'Three Billboards' is, from start to finish, a great movie. I can't imagine anyone not enjoying it."
"4064","Three Billboards Outside Ebbing, Missouri",9,"Tense and unpredictable in every way.","This movie I went into almost blind, but I came out of the theater with it probably being my favorite film in the last year. This film is so smart at being able to keep you at the edge of your seat from simple things that they plug into the film. Heartbreaking and tense situations in the first half of the film come back in some shape or form that leave you questioning what is going to happen. There was genuinely no predicting what the characters were going to do and how they would react to certain events. This unpredictability doesn't just apply to situations, but possibly more notable in character arcs. Without giving to much away, there is a character in this film that does everything possible for you to hate them in the first half, and by the end of the film you are rooting for said character. There's times where the characters that you cared for are becoming real and dis-likable in certain scenes, but to the point of more so being genuinely worried about how their choices will affect them.Every actor in this film did so tremendous as well. I really can't think of an actor or actress that outshines the rest. But if I had to pick favorites, Frances McDormand and Sam Rockwell were just that. But a lot of that just has to go into the writing of the characters themselves. The cinematography in this film allows the actors to take advantage of facial expression. There's a scene relatively early in the film that is mostly sitting and staring but the actors have such convincing movements and gestures, it goes to a point where you don't need dialogue to tell what they are feeling and what they are thinking about.Really the only issue I have in this film is some scenes felt a little unnecessary. Can't give away too much without spoiling, but in a film where every character goes through in arc, there's one character that is just there to break tension and crack personally unfunny jokes. But this character did not affect my score and they were barely in the film.I highly recommend checking this out."
"4065","Three Billboards Outside Ebbing, Missouri",9,"Cinema about hope and search for justice","The drama of Martin McDon, known primarily for his ability to violate the foundations of modern drama, can easily be considered one of the best in the outgoing year.In the center of the picture is the mother of the deceased girl, seeking justice and justice in a rather cynical manner and the unquenchable hope for which is the meaning of life, along with a single son and a worn blue overall.""Where is the cliche?"" - I thought, and already on the 10th minute of the movie I stopped speculating about the development of events and trying to predict the replicas and actions of the characters. This unpredictable plot was not in my memory for a long time, considering that all the events taking place for nearly two hours (and there were an unlimited number of them) surprise with their surprise and sometimes absurdity.The non-linear structure of the film makes the viewer systematically ask the question, ""What will be the end?"", But ""What will happen tomorrow?"". The same question is asked to themselves and all the characters: the divorced mother Mildred, who is already desperate to find justice, ultimately lives by today and actually loses the intelligible for herself and for the surrounding purpose, humiliating the policeman and accusing them of racism, sexism and other "" "". Sheriff Willoughby, who learned that he has cancer, does not know what will happen to his reputation after his death. The sheriff's widow does not know what will happen to her daughters. The assistant to the sheriff Dixon sits up his pants and reads comics, having no motivation, no prospects, nothing.The appearance of three billboards in Ebbinge literally leads this small town into a rage. The hunt for Mildred is accompanied by violence on the screen, both from her side and from her ill-wishers (scenes in the dentist's office, as well as in the advertising firm). Even the church involved in the scandal gets gets on the forehead of Martin McDonagh, who calls her ""a criminal group"" and ""lovers of little boys, and in general, boys."" The whole town shows all the dirt, like a fish, rotten from head to tail, stinks of hypocrisy.Thus, the unyielding willpower of the heroine Francis McDormand and her motivation, which at some point is questioned, makes the actress, perhaps, the main nominee for the Academy Award. And the abundance of all sorts of characters (including the hero of Sam Rockwell), well-designed, but sometimes fantastic scenario and satire on acute social problems (racism, sexual harassment, police lawlessness, etc.) make the Three Billboard reflect modern disgusting reality and valuable ( if not the most expensive) coin along with Bruges and the Seven Psychopaths in the treasury of the talented Martin McDonagh.Bravo, McDonagh!"
"4066","Three Billboards Outside Ebbing, Missouri",10,"Wow...I mean...just wow","What a movie and what great acting. Frances McDormand has done amazing job and deserves awards for playing Mildred Hayes. Although a very serious subject, this movie is a comedy.The punch lines are to the point and absolutely hilarious. I went to the Toronto International Film Festival to watch this movie and boy, do I consider myself lucky to have decided to watch it.The story, screenplay, direction are amazing. After The Grand Budapest Hotel, this movie comes as a breath of fresh air."
"4067","Three Billboards Outside Ebbing, Missouri",9,"Drama and comedy at the highest level","I went to see this movie because I hadn't seen any trailers to it. It's something I do because trailers are unreliable and spoiling, but also this case was based around the sheer number of good reviews. I can't even describe how surprised i was when i started to invest in the drama, and I really got my money worth when seeing it in the theaters. This is a movie that grips you good from the start, and holds the tension of the backstory right up until the end. The characters are phonemically written, and the actors did a hell-of-a-good job portraying them. This is a movie that could have been written off with a ""strong protagonist""-cinda-story, but unfolds to a much more deep and philosophical tone. To be honest! not much happens in this film, but because of the powerfull characters within - every little detail about their lives, becomes of great importance throughout. I can say without a doubt, that this is my favourite movie of the year (2017...Ofc.)"
"4068","Three Billboards Outside Ebbing, Missouri",6,"I dissent. Regretfully.","I wanted this movie to be great. It wasn't. The performance by Frances McDormand is good but not great. She's very good at showing overwhelming anger, but that's all she's allowed. Her character never gets the chance to breathe. Blame the script, not her--she's a terrific actor, but this is a one-note performance.2. There is a sub-theme about race. Race is an important issue and deserves to be treated honestly, but in this movie, it felt like a side-road that led nowhere. (It actually feels like moral preening on the part of the scriptwriter. It didn't add much to the movie's meaning.3. Wonderful performances by Woody Harrelson and Sam Rockwell as a police chief and officer. Woody especially brought grace to a character who at first seemed unsympathetic. (BTW, McDormand's ex-husband has a young and beautiful girlfriend, and that relationship is treated as awkward and shameful. Harrelson's wife is young and beautiful, and that relationship is treated as idyllic.) 4. Police officers don't talk like that among themselves or to others.5. I particularly didn't like the Chief's take on racist cops, saying essentially that all cops are racist. That may be accepted as dogma by some Hollywood screenwriters, but any chief who talks about his beloved employees--or cops in general--like that shouldn't be a cop. Coming from this character, the sentiment is cheap and clunky and inexplicable.6. There are a couple of plot holes wide enough to drive a billboard through sideways. The most egregious (no spoiler here) is what happens (actually what should have happened but didn't) immediately following the window scene. (You'll know the scene when you see it.) The thing not happening was necessary keep the plot going. Everything that happened after that feels tainted as artificial and contrived. Likewise a later scene in a bar, involving a coincidence beyond coincidence.7. It's impossible McDormand's character wouldn't have been arrested several times in the course of the movie, for several serious crimes. Once again, he plot depends on that not happening, and thus the plot again is contrived.8. There's a letter delivered to Rockwell's character late in the movie which is full of Hallmark Card sentimental drivel. It can't be justified by either what we know of that character or what we know of the writer.In a world (as the movie trailers used to say) where we are awash in numbskull comic book movies and incoherent special effects spectacles, it was a small miracle this film even came to my local cinema. Too bad I couldn't love it."
"4069","Three Billboards Outside Ebbing, Missouri",10,"'All this anger, man, it just begets greater anger.'","Martin McDonagh (In Bruges, Seven Psychopaths) wrote and directed this very tough but brilliant story about anger, revenge, agony, prejudice - and redemption. Every character in this dramatic tour de force is drawn with equal parts hate and anger - with a dollop of hope and forgiveness and reconciliation in the end. It is a phenomenal achievement. The language is saturated with foul/vulgar/trash type language but it fits the area and the particular character in this darkly comic drama. After months have passed without a culprit in her daughter's murder case, Mildred Hayes (Frances McDormand) makes a bold move, painting three signs leading into her town with a controversial message directed at William Willoughby (Woody Harrelson), the town's revered chief of police. When his second-in-command Officer Dixon (Sam Rockwell), an immature mother's boy with a penchant for violence, gets involved, the battle between Mildred and Ebbing's law enforcement is only exacerbated. Mildred's son (Lucas Hedges) is seemingly the only stable character despite his absentee father (John Hawkes) and 19-year-old girlfriend (Samara Weaving) antics and his mother's foul pained mood. The pinnacle of angry young men is policeman Dixon (Sam Rockwell in a brilliant performance) whose movements include severely harming the sign maker (Caleb Landry Jones) as well as violating all manner of laws. Peter Dinklage portrays James, the 'town midget' whose role is also key to the denouement of the action.Rape, murder, arson and many other forms of violence fill the screen but McDonagh makes it all make sense. McDormand, Rockwell, and Harelson are astonishingly but then there isn't a weak member in this extraordinary cast. This is one of the best films of the year, despite the subject matter at the core of it."

"4072","Three Billboards Outside Ebbing, Missouri",1,"Nasty and Ugly","If this movie is considered not only to be entertainment but a work of art worthy of cinematic awards and an endorsement of Hollywood's encouragement for more like it to be produced then it's a sad day for the industry. I found it to be nasty, ugly piece of work that sets out to portray men in the foulest light possible for no better reason than to play to the current drumbeat of every social movement wanting to distance itself from Harvey Weinstein and Donald Trump.I can only guess the claim to being a 'comedy' albeit a black comedy, is to justify a certain degree of satire in stereotyping the white guys as racist, mysogenists on the defensive against the unexpected attack of the movie's downtrodden feminist principle character.The fact is, ordinary people do not act or talk the way these characters do. The dialog is devoted to extreme expletives raging on in hate for each other and proving and achieving nothing in the process. Ironically the result is extremely racially offensive and sexist and even manages to be debasing to dwarfs; and for this trash they award oscars?"
"4073","Three Billboards Outside Ebbing, Missouri",1,"Fair story that lost it by going all liberal.","How in the world did this get any Oscar attention??? The story line was so bland that the dry comedic effort of the writers was the only thing that made it worth watching all the way through. So the above board story line is that a mother is angry and distraught at the lack of effort being made towards finding the killer of her daughter. She pays for some billboards towards that effect. The billboards cause a lot of friction in the small town in southern Missouri where she lives. And around and around it swirls.... For nearly TWO HOURS!Now here is the story that Hollywood really wants to tell you. Everyone who lives in small town Midwestern towns is dumb, alcoholic, and incredibly dysfunctional. Well everyone is provided that their white. If you live in a small Midwestern town and you're black, well then you're a well balanced, hard working , decent person with good common sense.Of the 50 or so characters seen in the movie, I recall three were black. They were the only characters that exhibited any intelligence, decency and good common sense. Every single adult character that I recall otherwise was portrayed as having at least one version of a serious flaw in their character. They of course were white.I hear the lead actress got up on stage at the Oscars and went political. I find that funny given that her character was probably the most flawed in the movie. Her character was unreasonable, angry, violent, and generally unloving.
Overall the sociopolitical undertones of the movie were irritating. So grateful that I didn't spend a dime to see it."

(I also elevate a score when something is of the ""so bad it's kind of great"" variety, like ""The Room"" or ""Oogieloves and the Big Balloon Adventure""). ""Three Billboards Outside Ebbing, Missouri"" (which is one of the most awful titles in ages) is that rare find: something perfectly bad with zero redeeming qualities.The plot seems to hinge on a woman hellbent on finding the man who raped and killed her daughter -- ooh, a revenge mystery! Actually, this crime, like everything else in the film, is just a self-consciously writerly device to get people to bloviate in the same tone with each other on sundry topics that have nothing to do with the crime. There's a deep well of syrup and cornball below the acid river of misanthropic shit that flows through every scene. There isn't an ounce of sincerity in anyone's relation to another -- it's all pure manipulation, formulaic broad strokes that in every aspect have been done better 100 or 1000 times already. Lots of decent actors have ""big moment"" cries, but it's all empty, hollow-ringing verbiage. Had I but world enough and time, I'd gleefully dissect this abortive mess, and I concede this is more an ""F-U"" to the director/writer than a review, but I already feel my life wasting away minutes as I contemplate this execrable film past its due."

It just cuts off and doesn't complete the story. I screamed ""What?!"" at the television when the credits rolled. It seems more and more movies are doing this and it's just frustrating. I'll leave the thorough reviews to the professionals, but I needed to warn anybody else who enjoy movies that actually finish the story."
"4076","Three Billboards Outside Ebbing, Missouri",6,"Maybe a bit overrated?","I watched this movie after having heard a lot about it and I was a bit disappointed. Maybe it is because I was tired, but I feel asleep several times.
The storyline is interesting but low and the message is intense, important, but already heard in many other movies and books.
Violence creates violence, only forgiveness or the ability to leave things go can stop the circle: it is absolutely true, however we already know it.
The picture of the United States in a quiet small village is maybe too negative and exagerated, the total opposite of some american comedies in which everything seems perfect: here everything seems corrupted, violent, full of anger and hate, hypocritical.
Maybe this movie has been overrated by the critics?"
"4077","Three Billboards Outside Ebbing, Missouri",6,"Disappointing","After hearing a lot of praise and having been fond of the cast, I thought this would be a slam dunk for me, but I left disappointed. I will keep this review concise and sweet.The acting is above average and the main players especially have solid roles that they make the most of. Unfortunately,one of the main problems to me was the sheer loathsomeness of every character, McDormand's included. I'm all for dark comedies, gritty film making and art that explores the dark side of life, but the interactions that the characters have in this film are downright unpleasant. One scene after another. There is also a heavy racist undertone in the film, as well as stereotypes of southern life, crooked cops and racist hillbillies. The few black characters in the movie are portrayed as straight laced and well adjusted, at times saviors, while the crazy deranged white folks engage in all kinds of derelict behavior. 6/10"
"4078","Three Billboards Outside Ebbing, Missouri",2,"Really!","I went to this movie expecting good things after it won several awards and was so highly praised. Frances McDormand succeeds in making a woman whose daughter was raped and murdered be completely unsympathetic. I have seen a few plays written by Martin McDonagh so I know he can be dark but come on..........do people in the movie business really think everyone in flyover country is a rube, hayseed, racist, wife beater? Do teenage boys regularly call their mother ""cunt"" to her face? On what planet do these people live? I have a suggestion for Hollywood film-makers who want to show how sophisticated and edgy they are. Make a movie about Harvey Weinstein and all his Hollywood cohorts who turned a blind eye to his antics."
"4079","Three Billboards Outside Ebbing, Missouri",1,"Tedious garbage masquerading as art.","Boring and slow but I watched it in its entirety in the same way one morbidly looks at a bad highway accident because the movie is enlightening as to how low functioning, ignorant and racist Hollywood perceives the average person (you & me) to be. The police are portrayed as stupid to the point of mental retardation, openly committing violent & utterly pointless felonies in front of countless witnesses. They are inexplicably not held accountable for their actions. Likewise, when our almost equally ignorant hero firebombs a police station, the entire community knows she did it, and yet nothing comes from it. Such a crime would be an international news story that would mandate a major FBI investigation. The point is, this movie is completely detached from reality in every regard. Real people don't think or talk this way. People don't act this way. Reality dictates that there are unavoidable consequences for bad choices that don't apply in the fantasy world of this movie. Although this movie is not unique in this regard, I don't know that I have ever seen one so overtly contemptuous of common people. Ironic given the lack of education and real world experience that most of these Hollywood elitists actually have. Here is a tip for Hollywood on how to make real art instead of this garbage masquerading as art: in reality, the differences between the average person and the smug elites is negligible. A few bad choices for those without a safety net can create a life trajectory very difficult to recover from. Enough with the smug disrespect for customer base."
"4080","Three Billboards Outside Ebbing, Missouri",1,"Awards? Really!!??","One of the worst movies I've ever seen. Waaay too many cuss words & the story line was all over the place. I want to be entertained not work trying to figure out where two hours went!"
"4081","Three Billboards Outside Ebbing, Missouri",3,"An attempt at replicating a Cohen brothers movie","When I entered the theater I had not checked the director and writer for this film in maybe a week, so I continually asked myself if it was a Cohen brothers film, which to me is bad when it's actually written/directed by someone else. I think that there is a difference between paying homage to artists and downright imitating them.The protagonist (who is played by Frances McDormand) is presented to us a likable person at first. But when she speaks to the police about her problems she seems quite nazi-esque. She wants to draw and test blood from every person who lives in her town to find a criminal. When the police chief informs her that such a thing is impossible because it would be a gross violation of people's civil rights, she doesn't care. He replies, ""he could have been a man who was just passing through the state."" ""Then let's take blood from everyone in the country."" Sure... She says it quite seriously. Repulsive.Woody Harrelson provides good acting, but there are multiple scenes in the movie when he does voice-over for comic relief that are mildly amusing at first but feel stale and forced rather quickly. There were many times when I just wanted to shut it off-- when someone is stretching irreverence out to the point of being unrealistic and absurd it's just bad writing. It's also bad form to have so much voice-over in any movie.In the early going, Sam Rockwell's cop character is the type of person who would strike me as reprehensible yet tolerable. When he pistol whips an innocent man and woman then beats the man to within an inch of his life he goes from tolerable to I-want-this-moron-to-die. As other people have noted, the police chief (who witnessed all of these things in person) wouldn't just fire such a person. He would be arrested and convicted for attempted murder. Instead, the chief fires him in an almost nonchalant manner.There is also an additional embarrassingly stupid scene in which Rockwell's character thinks that he is overhearing a violent criminal brag to his friend about his crimes. When the criminal confronts him... he scratches his face... then stares at him. Again, the Rockwell character is borderline retarded, but even the dumbest among us have a survival instinct. When I saw this scene play out I thought that it was part of a strategy or plan-- the Rockwell character wanted to get the guys arrested for assault so he could make his case to the police chief. Nope. Just more idiocy.It has a few solid comedic moments. But I would never watch this film again."
"4082","Archive",9,"Ummm... wow.","*EDIT: I just saw this a 2nd time. Knowing the ending made this an entirely different film - surprisingly in a good way. Sure the surprise wont be there, but seeing it again through a different perspective and knowing certain things, I picked up so many metaphors and clues! Thus I had to up my rating from 8/10 to 9/10. Brilliant film. See it again!
------------I'm still trying to take it all in and absorb the finale. But, wow.This is going to be one of those films that viewers either don't enjoy, or love. I was getting a little bored after the midway portion, and the slow pacing of the 109 min runtime really felt like the film was dragging its heels, but the satisfaction and reward towards the end made it all worthwhile, at least for me.Take into account that the brilliant writing and on-point directing, is the first full length feature film by Gavin Rothery, with only one prior short film for this new filmmaker. So for putting such a high caliber, wonderfully vibrant and expertly captivating feature film debut, for this first-time filmmaker, much respect and mad props to him. Rothery is certainly a filmmaker with a ton of potential and one to watch.It's not your typical sci-fi, as it had many layers, and creates an engrossing study of human frailty and obsession intertwined with AI. The cinematography was outstanding, with exceptional and gorgeously shot scenes, production-designed sets, and S/Vfx. The score was very fitting and really set the tone for the entire film. Theo James and the rest of the cast, nailed their characters.Had this film's pace been a little faster, and/or 10-15 mins shaved off from the runtime, this film would've been perfect. I'll definitely be watching this one again, but only after the stunned feeling leaves my stomach. It's a well deserved 8/10 for this film and newb filmmaker from me.

"4083","Archive",8,"A very well done movie. Twists, turns and surprises will have you guessing till the end!!","This was quite a well done movie. These days most movies you know where theyre going long before they get there. I thought I had this one pegged thru out but it kept coming up with surprises. These days they dumb down a lot of movies so everyone in the audience gets the story but that tends to let you guess the end long before you get there. Im happy to say not this one. Everytime you think its going to be this type of movie it turns into another type and that continues until the surprising ending which the film gives nothing away about until the last couple of minutes. Great acting great cinematography. Definitely worth a watch through. Enjoy"
"4084","Archive",9,"Loved this movie!","What an awesome and visually impressive movie. Ending blew my mind and never saw it coming. Highly recommend!"
"4085","Archive",8,"Fantastic sci-fi movie, best I've seen since Ex Machina","I expect a lot of people will compare this to Ex Machina, and for good reasons. Excellent story, interesting character development, great acting and directing, this is definitely the kind of smart, evenly paced sci-fi I love (if you're expecting explosions, lasers and flying car chases, you're gonna have a bad time...).
While it may be using familiar tropes and the occasional cliche, this truly is a 7/10 throughout that earns its 8th star in the last 15 min. Highly recommended, especially for sci-fi fans!"
"4086","Archive",9,"Good science fiction","Good hard sci-fi. The setting is supposedly 2038. Maybe a bit early. I'd say 2075.In any case it's a good science fiction story that has writing and acting flaws, but the plot is solid and carries it."
"4087","Archive",4,"Boring, late-entrant in an over-saturated genre","Another run-of-the-mill A.I. movie about a secluded man obsessed with re-creating life in a metal body. Usually those films can be thought-provoking and innovative. But this one isn't. And results in a dry, meaningless plot with boring characters. It even has its own abysmal attempt at the Ex-Machina dance scene.But with that said, there is one very good touch to this movie. One that's unfortunately let down by the other 95% (that doesn't allow it to have the impact that it perhaps should have done). A nice idea, but poorly executed.Also, this movie is a perfect example of how NOT to use a score (music). More producers need to understand that it's not necessary to fill every second of a movie with an over-bearing score in the background. Because in doing so, the viewer loses the ability to notice which parts of the film something profound, sad, exciting, revealing or exciting is about to happen. The whole movie is filled with futuristic sci-fi ambience music; making every scene/segment of the movie feel exactly the same. Not helpful when the entire plot of the film is already set in one compound with very limited characters. It makes the whole viewing experience even more boring.If the producers of this film need to learn how to use the score correctly, refer to Moon (2009) and how it used Clint Mansell's masterful soundtrack."
"4088","Archive",10,"Unexpected & Thought Provoking","This film was beautifully shot & acted. The premise is quite thought provoking and really makes you question what would you want when you pass away. Theo James never disappoints and this is another phenomenal performance. It takes an amazing actor to carry a film and he does it effortlessly. I was not familiar with Stacy Martin prior to this film, but was extremely impressed by her. She takes on the challenge of playing the different forms of Jules and makes you feel for each version. She beautifully brings the human essence to J3. I love a movie that gives you that dropped mouth & OMG moment - this one does not disappoint!"
"4089","Archive",9,"What the F ???","Maybe my first time for a review. I really think that movie deserved it, at least.
A very good SF movie and very well directed.Just watch it .... and after ...you will be thinking ""what the F....."""
"4090","Archive",10,"Intriguing with a Twist","Archive is a great movie with wonderful actors, special shout out to Theo James, great setting, cool old school sets, and an interesting storyline. And a gobsmacking ending."
"4091","Archive",10,"fantastic sci-fi","This was fantastic. The acting was superb. The plot set up empathetic characters. I wasn't familiar with the Female lead. I would look for her again in other media. She did an excellent job portraying a robot with AI. I think this is maybe the most dynamic role I have seen Theo James play. I love the way it ended, which is unusual. A lot of movies these days fail to tie things together and give a satisfying ending, but this one made so much sense to the storyline. I can't wait to watch it again for all the little things I missed. ""Two Thumbs Up"""
"4092","Archive",10,"Gavin Rothery has a big hit on his hands","The great writing is evident through out the movie. The locations are beautifully shot and the only thing you are left wanting at the end of the movie is to go and watch it all over again."
"4093","Archive",4,"Boring, slow and overrated","I would not recommend this who loves sci fi genre, first hour of the movie is way to slow with not much plot in it, dragged throughout the whole movie i skipped at thr ending to complete it. I would rate it 4 only for cinematography and special effects."
"4094","Archive",3,"A cheap version of Transcendence (2014)","The concept isn't original (""Transcendence"" is way better). Didn't like musicalization.The storyline is flat, sad and unclear."
"4095","Archive",10,"Excellent Sci-Fi Thriller!","The movie looks at artificial intelligence in a somewhat familiar, but different angle. The movie is well-written with a twist on the basic concept of artificial intelligence. It moves along at a good pace, and keeps you guessing at every turn. Will he succeed or not? Will he be discovered before he can finish his project? Will guilt get the best of him? Tune in and you will not be disappointed!"
"4096","Archive",10,"MUST SEE!!","This is definitively a must watch for anyone. The acting, music, story and cinematography are all spectacular. It's very thought provoking and is like no other sci-fi film I've watched."
"4097","Archive",10,"An incredibly written/directed first film for Rothery","Hours later I'm still thinking about this film. Gavin Rothery has created an otherworldly environment that is both ethereal and industrial at the same time (can that even be a thing but it is). The J3 sequence (when you watch you'll know what I'm talking about) is super bad-a$$ cool. It's indescribable. The cinematography is stunning and the score is gorgeous. Kudos to Theo James and Stacy Martin for their stellar performances. Without saying too much, the ending will leave you gob-smacked and in need of a rewatch."
"4098","Archive",10,"Excellent film well worth a watch","If you're a Sci Fi fan you'll enjoy this film, with some amazing futuristic aesthetics reminiscent of the fifth element and blade runner. I won't spoil it for you, it's an excellent film with a good story, albeit not original but with some nice twists and turns and certainly well told with great performances from the cast."
"4099","Archive",8,"An astonishing sci-fi film *","* There is no end credit scene *Gavin Rothery in his directional debut! plus crew brought an astonishing sci-fi film. The story is about a scientist trying to build artificial intelligence to bring his wife back from the dead. The movie sets a familiar storyline around the film Ex Machina (2014) but it still stands on its own. It was so painful to watch because most scenes are heartbreaking, and depending on what you believe in the emotions will pour out. If men create something it could have feelings and this film show the consequences of building phase after phase to perfection in a different humanity perspective. The decisions of the scientist made me feel sometimes hurt even though he has a sentimental purpose, but one can't be blinded to other things. I loved the ending it was unpredictable and I was amazed by the double meaning of resolve by its point of view.The composer Steven Price brings the science fiction so beautifully while adding a sorrowful feel into his music. This is the kind of film where the music must be in awe to achieve the touch of emotions and it successfully created a lot of different feelings.The cast was great, and Theo James carries amazingly the whole film but my loyalty lies in his creations. Even if they are robotics, J1 and J2 showed so much feeling and the way they care is too much to bear."
"4100","Archive",10,"Mind Blown - WOW!","This film started off slow, but once you're into it, it blows your mind. If you enjoy AI and sci-fi then this film is for you. The cinematography is stunning, the story is thought provoking, and the acting is superb. The emotional acting kept me riveted throughout. As is the case with Theo James films, you feel every emotion throughout. It's been a long time since a movie this good has effected me so deeply. Worth a watch and prepare to have your mind blown."
"4101","Archive",5,"Great visuals predictably disappointing ending","Archive started with so much promise. The story was intriguing to start but lost its way trying to incorporate genre cliches, easter eggs, and or homages to other movies. What many people took as visual extensions to the narrative of the film, ""which are breathtaking"" they are little more then space fillers and do nothing more for the film then allow to create your narrative within those silent moments. This can be very useful is some films, ie. (The Shining, or interstellar) this is not one of them. There is a clear path set out for you that is abruptly taken off course for an (upgrade) esque ending but fails to connect it to the rest of the movie. The larger entities in the movie lack depth therefore are left to the viewer to interpret. The lead is the most forgettable character as the robots show more humanity the he does, which I thought was the underlying storyline. I enjoyed j2 as she grappled with the reality of her existence and relationship to the lead. but once again left my with more questions as the end does not explain why she even existed or why we see her apart from the lead character. I would say it is worth a watch for the visuals but will not make my sci fi rotation"
"4102","Archive",10,"Brilliantly touching","Beautiful movie, surprisingly emotional for a scifi. Amazing performances from the cast especially Theo James who finally gets the chance to show his acting range in a movie! Stunning visuals and great writing/direction from Gavin Rothery.

"4104","Archive",10,"great movie","Uts really one of the best ending movies...you must watch this movie."
"4105","Archive",10,"More ""Moon"" than ""Ex Machina""","Gavin Rothery begins a new career as director with a well written and visually stunning sci-fi movie.
In 2009, Rothery was a key figure behind Duncan Jones' sci-fi masterpiece ""Moon"": the moon base, Gerty the robot and all the vehicles were all designed by him.
Now, Rothery gives another proof of his visual talent with ""Archive"".
Some people said that ""Archive"" is a sort of ""Ex Machina meets Black Mirror"", but I think that's not the right comparison.
In my opinion this movie is more a spiritual sequel to ""Moon"", with the same depht in all its charactersations and the same taste for world building and atmosphere.
Yeah, maybe ""Moon"" was more innovative, but I don't care. This is a kind of sci-fi that's extremely difficoult to find today.
This movie is precious. Go watch it immediately if you like the genre"
"4106","Archive",6,"Great design, and that's about it","I caught this at a Drive-In double feature with ""Palm Springs."" I think that pairing made this pale in comparison.I will say that I was VERY impressed with the production design and the special effects; nothing looked cheesy or unrealistic (I haven't found any budget information anywhere yet). And that's about it. Theo James has the looks of a young De Niro or James Franco from time to time, but he (or his character) is quite charmless.It's strange that this reminded me of ""Moon"" so much, when you consider that the director of this film worked on ""Moon"" back in 2009. But that film is buoyed by an engrossing Sam Rockwell performance. And ""Ex Machina"" has the balance of Domnhall Gleeson and Oscar Issac's performances. Theo James can't really anchor this whole movie. The other actors are fine, but seem ornamental.This is above-average for its design, but middle-of-the-road for just about everything else."
"4107","The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring",10,"An absolutely incredible film!","Simply incredible. Never before have I seen a 3 hour movie that didn't seem like 3 hours. I read the Lord of the Rings very recently and I was surprised at how similar Peter Jackson's vision was to my own.Now about the omissions and alterations. I'm not a crazed fanatic who gets worked up over every little detail. I didn't mind Arwen's inflation and I'm actually glad Tom Bombadil was scrubbed (I felt Tom Bombadil was an unnecessary addition to the book). Despite these minor changes, the screenplay stays extremely close to the book and flows very very well (and the prologue was a nice touch).The acting was flawless. As I've read many many times in other reviews, McKellen doesn't play Gandalf, he IS Gandalf. Wood, Mortensen, Holm, Astin, everyone was fantastic. My hat's off to Sean Bean who delivers an excellent performance as Boromir, a character who's intentions are good but wrestles with the corrupting power of the Ring. Bean portrays it VERY well. Oh, and Andy Serkis does a PERFECT Gollum voice. It's EXACTLY as I imagined it myself.The special effects were incredible, the cave troll, the balrog, Gollum, and Sauron's Eye all looked amazing. I was also very impressed by the seamless shrinking of the vertically challenged characters.What's wrong with this movie? I have no idea... I thought everything was perfect. MY biggest gripe is having to wait an entire year to see The Two Towers!"
"4108","The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring",NA,"Wow!","Breathtaking.  Unique.  Captivating.  Enchanting.Within minutes of the start of this first chapter of an undeniably epic trilogy, the audience was left gasping at the intensity of the images on the screen.  And we had nearly three hours to go.The scope of Tolkien's masterpiece may have eluded film-makers for decades, but director Peter Jackson makes good on his promise: he has not only brought us the tale of Frodo and his bold companions, he has brought us Middle Earth.  And believe me, it is BIG.  Sweeping vistas and hang-onto-your-seat camera shots send us zooming through the towering cities and citadels of Tolkien's imagination.But even more impressive than the stunning visuals and sound-effects-like-you've-never-heard-before are the actors who breathe life into the characters.  Ian McKellen's portrayal of Gandalf is nothing short of awe-inspiring, and Elijah Wood's Frodo is one of the most unexpectedly captivating performances I've seen in a long time.  The despair, terror, and determination of the Fellowship is all there, in spades.  I left the theater aching...from tensing every muscle during the fight and flight sequences--the breathless and compelling kind we haven't seen since Spielberg gave us a desperate charge onto the D-Day beaches of Normandy.Those unfamiliar with Tolkien's world may quickly find themselves lost in it, but happily so.  The depth of his creation cannot be grasped in a few hours, and it doesn't need to be; the struggle of good against evil explodes on the screen, and leaves little room for complaint.The movie ended with a stunned audience sitting on the edges of their seats, feeling somewhat bereft.  We were exhausted, but no one wanted to wait a year for more.Jackson's ambitious first chapter is truly unlike anything you've seen this year.  George Lucas and Chris Columbus take note: this is how you deliver on a cinematic promise.For everyone else: don't you dare miss it."
"4109","The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring",10,"Great","It is my firm belief that the standard versions of The Lord of the Rings should be jettisoned in favour of the extended editions universally. Sure, the near 4 hour runtime is a tad steep, but for an absolute masterpiece like this, it's work every second and the first act of undoubtedly the best trilogy in cinematic history!"
"4110","The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring",NA,"Embrace the magic","It is with no surprise that Peter Jackson's The Fellowship of the Ring film has received such mixed critics. Many viewers refer to it as being childish, boring and uninteresting. Seems to me that it is bound to the same fate of Tolkien's books, destined to be a target for the same type of misunderstandings that keep attacking this literary masterpiece many decades after it's first publication.Having read the books several years ago, I went to see this `impossible' film when it came out with many doubts on my mind. I really liked it, but left the theater with as many doubts as I had before. Was it perfect? Well, maybe not, but what an achievement. After watching it a few times on DVD, and thinking about it for some time now, I find myself loving this film more and more. Let me tell you why...The Lord of the Rings is a fairy-tale of myth and fantasy. Peter Jackson directed a film that was considered, for a very long time, impossible to make, and not only for technical reasons. The narrative roots are incredibly long and detailed, and the storyline is deeply connected with the creation of a fantastic continent from a time unknown called `Middle Earth'. It's author, Tolkien, dedicated a considerable part of his life developing this continent's background, it's mythology and origins, it's different kinds of people, cultures and languages, and therefore it's geographic references are determinant to the unfolding of the story of the One Ring.Peter Jackson went out to achieve the impossible and came out with a recreation of the original that is pure and true to the story in every detail. The first time the four hobbits meet a black rider on the road, for example, is absolutely faithful to the feeling of the book. The assault of the riders at Weathertop is another great example, and it captures that feeling of danger, density and atmosphere that are the main characteristics of the tale. Jackson also took some liberties with the story, and made some right choices along the way. If the so called `purists' may not approve the removal of Tom Bombadil altogether, it should be comprehensible that the travel from Hobbiton to Rivendel is a very long and detailed one and could easily make a movie on it's own. I felt more uneasy with how short the Council of Elrond was. In the book, the council is where the whole story of the rings is first explained, and many passages from the past ages of Middle Earth are unveiled. It is a fascinating moment of the story, that had to be shortened for obvious reasons. Still, after some consideration, I now agree with the options made by Peter Jackson, and think that the movie prologue narrated by Galadriel was the wisest choice. The magic is all there when Gandalf shuts his eyes the moment Frodo stands in the council and says `I will take the ring'. It is there at Moria's Gate, and at the fall of Boromir. It is a powerful film that doesn't fit the rhythm of the standard Hollywood action movie. It is a film that breeds, that takes time to unfold, it's tale branching in every direction.I could go on and on, talking about all the different elements that bring this film close to perfection, but I'll end saying that deep down, this is not about action, beards and big monsters. The greatest thing about this film, to me, is that it brought me back to a time when I was in love with a different world where everything was possible. Reading The Lord of the Rings night after night, I came to understand what this thing of `mankind' really was all about. The corruption of absolute power, the importance and value of friendship, the inevitability of growing up, the strength of hope... That this film could capture that magic, and be a new bearer to it's message of humanism, is a statement to it's greatness. Gandalf's words, that even the smallest person may change the course of the world, and have a part to play in the destiny of all, are immortal.In the end, this is a wonderful film, but that doesn't mean you are going to like it. I cannot tell you what it is like to see this film if you don't know or love the book. But I hope it may plant a seed on your heart to discover a great world of fantasy, beauty and humanity. I believe Tolkien would have liked that."
"4111","The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring",10,"Never before in my life were my cheeks more aching...","...but oh was I thankful for it!!! All through the movie I kept on having this big large smile sculpted into my face. For the record, I'm 25 years old, and I've read ""The Lord of the Rings"" in three times for the first time when I was six or seven years old. Ever since then, I read it at least once or twice a year - therefore you can count me as a fan, for I follow the same cult fan procedure with ""The Hobbit"" and ""The Silmarillion"" as well. Now onto the movie... Gosh, I saw it more than one time, and I keep wanting more of it. It just never gets boring! I really enjoyed the little stuff that is found throughout the movie for fans of the books (the map on Bilbo's table in his house comes to mind, it is exactly as the one in ""The Hobbit"" book that I own), and I also incredibly enjoyed the intro sequence with the re-telling of the battle against Sauron from the Silmarillion, never has an ultimate evil being been so well depicted on the screen. It truly is Sauron. Those who argue the movie cuts too many parts or that it changes the story too much are totally wrong. This movie could not have shown the whole first time in its entirety - keep in mind that the audiobook version of 'Fellowship of the Ring' lasts well over ten hours, making a movie this long would, well, make it way too long and besides, how would you financially sustain such a project? I've read a reviewer saying he'd make all three books with the time allowed for the first movie alone. I think it would be a very fast-forwarding experience of a movie with 'Alvin and the Chimpmunks' kind of voices, incredibly stupid to say the least.Ok, so there are changes in the movie - well, this is Jackson's vision of it. All of us have our own visions of the books, which may or may not be compatible with that of Jackson's, but I can safely assume that nobody can say they have a hundred percent the same vision of the story as Tolkien; that's the thing with books: each reader has a different vision of it. As for me, I was blown away. Never before have I felt so much at home in a movie, it is as if I had taken a walk in the town where I grew up, the Shire, Rivendell, Moria, Lorien, everything felt so much like home, I was moved. I cannot tell of another movie that had me shed tears just by seeing a landscape on screen.As for the changes, well, I found good reasons behind all of them, and let me tell you right away, I was happy that Arwen saved Frodo, yes, maybe coming from a fan it will look like absolute heresy, but I enjoyed the scene a lot. I did not enjoy it because it was supposedly politically-correct to do so, or that I find Liv Tyler to be absolutely attractive; it was just because I felt like even though it was a big change from the book, it was a very good one indeed, it makes you discover the power, determination, and courage of elves and the fact that even elven women, although great in their beauty and seemingly fragile in appearance do not have anything to envy to their male counterparts. And beside, as Arwen is to become a Queen later on, it was pretty good to see her have a great first appearance.The actors were great, they were a lot into their characters, and for the first time, I saw elves as they were, quick, agile, terrifyingly effective in battle - just look at how Legolas dealed with the hordes of enemies without a single hint of fear in his eyes - these are elves as they should be. Gimli was great too, I know people seem to think many characters were not developed enough, but by the actions you can learn a lot. With Gimli a lot can be learned about the dwarves, their pride, deep sense of honor and family, their mistrust of elves, their love for strong beer and a good fight against anything bigger, and their sheer hatred for orcs and the likes. Aragorn was totally the ranger character, the ending scene as he walked toward the horde of Uruk-Hai warriors was great, his attitude, his clothes, everything about him just cried ""ranger"". Boromir was very well depicted, desperate to save the people of Gondor, by any mean necessary, robbed of all hope, yet in the end he redeems himself by showing his true valour, deep down, he's willing to die to defeat evil, and when he recognizes his king in Aragorn, on his last breath, I felt like watching a hero die, it was moving. The hobbits were all great, Frodo is deeply sad and fatalist, and Sam is just the 'best friend' everyone would like to have, just as it should be. Finally, we have Gandalf, quite frankly, he looks mighty, Ian IS Gandalf. The faceoff against the Balrog in the Moria is a memorable sequence, and just shows how strong he really is, to be able to vanquish such a foe. I can't wait for his return.Quite frankly, I can't wait for the two other movies... In the meantime, I'll watch this one over and over again. This movie has everything that a good movie needs to have, and more. Plus, it just might bring more people to actually read books that have more pages than the average little 25¢ novel that has no value in it, which is great. Parents, maybe some scenes will frighten your kids, but this movie has almost NO blood (even though it has a good share of battle) and the foes are undeniably evil, plus it has good values in it - friendship, courage, responsiblity, sacrifice for a good cause, and the belief that anyone can help to change things. This is worthy of Tolkien, this is a movie that will go down in history as being one of the best ever, for sure."
"4112","The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring",10,"First, And Still The Best Of LOTR","Here is one film that lived up to its hype, and by the time I saw it after it had arrived at the video stores, I had heard and read a ton of things about it, and seen all the awards it had received, and expected a lot. To my surprise, it did not disappoint.Now, several years later after having watched all three of these ""Rings"" films twice each, I still think this first movie of the trilogy is the best. It is a truly spectacular adventure story all the way through, probably the best ever put to film...and the first three hours of it is extra special. The following two films were very good, to be sure, but this first had a better mixture of the story. The second and third movies were almost entirely Frodo and his allies' long journey, but the first half of this movie also gives a good bit of interesting introductory material including a number of scenes at the Shire, before the long adventure starts. If you watch all three of these films consecutively the action wears you down by midway through the final episode and it almost becomes just too much That never gets a chance to happen with the ""Fellowship"" film.Anyway, ""Fellowship,"" stunned me for the visuals alone. I can't recall any film that has so many jaw-dropping scenes, one after the other, for three straight hours. Some are beyond description, and I don't care if they are computer- generated. So what? The fact is they are awesome to view, both in beauty and in staggering action scenes that feature incredible-looking monsters and other mythical characters.The story covers all kinds of terrain, too, from the lush Shire of the Hobbits, to the harsh neighboring landscapes. Each couple of minutes, as in the two movies that followed, scenes radically change from calmness to action, adventure to romance, sweet lovable characters to hideous monsters, on and on and on. It's an incredible movie experience."
"4113","The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring",10,"Greatest `Fantasy' Book become greatest `Fantasy' film","I think it is important to remember that Peter Jackson took up this film not in order just to make a film of `The Lord of the Rings' but because he wanted to make a 'fantasy just like the `The Lord of the Rings'"" as he himself put it.  After repeating that phrase on a number of occasions the question popped into his mind: ""Well, why not the `The Lord of the Rings' itself?"".  In doing this he, of course, set himself an enormous challenge: he had to make a really good `fantasy' film, one which would stand on its own and be true to what he had originally wanted to do but he would also, and here the task he had set himself was enormous, be true to the original book and to make a film which the legions of people who have loved this book would feel happy with.  In the latter task he was certainly not helped by the author or the book: Tolkein, it would seem, hated cinema.  The book itself is `HUGE': this was not going to be the kind of task that the James Ivory team set themselves, or Scorsese nor the kind of task facing Branagh with Hamlet; nor was it going to be like the puny task that faced Columbus with `Harry Potter' who had the bigger budget ($130 million for one film as compared with Peter Jackson with $300m for three).I have just seen the first `volume' and can say without hesitation that he has succeeded in both his goals.  It is not the book but a reading of the book which is inventive and fascinating.  It is the kind of experience that makes you want to go back and reread the whole thing in the light of the emphases that Jackson has brought to the story.  He focuses on the corrupting influence of the ring and, through this focus, the character of the chief protagonists of the story are revealed.  Clearly those most tempted by it are mortal men (Boromir and even, in one moment, Aragorn), those who already have power (Elrond - `The ring cannot stay here'; Galadriel; Gandalf and Saruman),  and, of course, those who would not normally desire it but who by accident become ring bearers - Gollum, Bilbo, Frodo.  I can see why, in this reading, Jackson decided to leave out the Bombadil episode.  Bombadil, like the Balrog, is beyond the ring but the latter is important to the unfolding of the story of the fates of all the characters, Bombadil isn't.It is a miracle of this reading of the first volume of the book that one can see where Jackson is going and one can get a feel of how the reading is going to unfold.  In a sense, Jackson's real trial - as far as those who know the books are concerned - will come with the second film in the series. He has lived up to our expectation by creating even bigger ones: how can he handle the story of the chase andrescue of Merry and Pippin, the storming of Isengard etc - stories which don't really add much to the core theme that is emerging.  Or is he now going to add the theme of the great contest of good versus evil to the unfolding reading?All of this points to the fact that the film, even though it is a feast of special effects, focuses on character.  And this also explains why Jackson chose the actors he did for their roles: they are not `big' names - no `Sean Connery', no `Alan Rickman', no `Brad Pitt', no `Sam Neill'etc.  He didn't want them getting in the way of the story of character.  Ian McKellan's talents, in particular, are used to tell a large proportion of the story: an enormous amount is conveyed simply through his facial expressions and even by the language of his body. The other miracle in all of this is Elijah Wood.  Like many others, when I first heard of Jackson's choice, I groaned: but Wood has been extraordinary.  He brings, as one friend said, a strange kind of androgyny to the role and this is just perfect. McKellan has already been knighted: give Wood the Oscar.And then there is Middle Earth: this is, as someone put it, another character in the story and the New Zealand landscape, digitally enhanced on occasion, lives up to its role too.Enough.  See this film!  Greatest film ever made?  How can one make a claim like that! Silly really; as silly as claiming that `The Lord of the Rings' is the greatest book ever written.  Can't one simply love a story, enjoy reading it a number of times amd lose oneself in it.  One CAN claim that it is the greatest work in its genre as is the film.10/10"
"4114","The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring",10,"The Fellowship of the Ring: Not just a Movie, but the Door to another Dimension","The first part of the Lord of the Rings trilogy, the Fellowship of the Rings opened the door to a whole new world for me. I'd never read any of Tolkien's books when I saw the film for the first time at the theatre and, now that I've read them, in retrospect I think being a neophyte to the mythology made my LOTR movie experience all the more miraculous.I loved The Two Towers and Return of the King almost as much as FOTR, but not quite, because seeing Fellowship for the first time was like taking a journey to a fabulous new place and meeting incredible new friends that you don't want to leave. I've never felt anything quite like what this epic evoked in me. It was akin to being a child again, with that tireless sense of wonder and enjoyment of each and every moment, maybe because as a child you are discovering your surroundings, and whatever age you are, when you watch the Fellowship of the Ring you are rendered in awe upon being introduced to the purity and beauty of Middle Earth and darkly enthralled by the majesty of Eisengard, Saruman, Sauron and all of their mighty malice. One of the things that makes this movie so special (and there are so many!) is that you fall in love not only with the ""good"" characters, but also with the ""evil"" ones. For example, Christopher Lee was amazing as Saruman, and I can't imagine the movie without him.Some films that might be comparable to the Lord of the Rings trilogy are: The Fifth Element, the Star Wars Trilogy parts IV, V and VI (forget the newer prequels), the Matrix trilogy (especially the first part), Interview with a Vampire, the Legend of Sleepy Hollow (with Johnny Depp), Logan's Run and The Island. They are all excellent movies and works of art that weave that movie magic that keeps you spellbound and entranced for the duration of their runtime.But after seeing The Fellowship of the Ring, I knew I had found the movie by which I would judge all other movies. Based on J.R.R. Tolkien's beloved books, Peter Jackson has set a new standard in the industry of cinema, one that I honestly think has not and won't be surpassed, at least not in my lifetime, not even by PJ himself.It is truly an instant classic that will stand the test of time and be loved by generations to come. God Bless Tolkien and Jackson and everyone involved in the conception and making of this film, for creating a world that is at my fingertips, only takes the touch of a button to go to whenever I want, and makes me forget everything else.The LOTR Trilogy is undoubtedly MY precious, the non plus ultra of all movies!"
"4115","The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring",NA,"Middle Earth comes alive...in breathtaking detail.","When I first saw the trailers for ""The Fellowship of the Ring,"" I had never had any interest in reading the lengthy tome of a trilogy.  But seeing the possibility of the movie, I immediately went out and read the whole thing, insisted on receiving it for Christmas, and enjoyed every minute of it. The feelings I had while reading the series were heightened seeing it come to life in the stunning movie.  I thought it was a fabulous work of art.I thought that having Galadriel tell what was basically the prologue of the book was a good idea, as it helped those who had never read the story.  It also immediately involved me in the film; I felt I had an insider's advantage on the rest of the audience.  Cate Blanchett has a wonderfully deep and emotional voice; the way she speaks Galadriel is almost as effective as her appearence as the Elven queen.  Also, showing the last battle of Isildur and Sauron helped unfog a part of the novel that had me a trifle confused.The entire movie is full of beautiful sets and landscapes.  The Shire was almost exactly as I'd pictured it.  Hobbiton is cute and very whimsical. Mordor was frighteningly well done, extremely real.  Rivendell had a little bit of a European-tourist-trap look, but was beautiful all the same.  The entire backdrop of the movie (the mountains, Moria, Isengard) was perfect; it's amazing that ""Fellowship"" was filmed in one country.Now to the characters.  All I can say is, ""Wow.""  I was a little apprehensive about the casting at first; I'd created such real images of the characters in my imagination, I almost didn't want them spoiled for me. However, I was not disapointed in the least.  Elijah Wood, though not one of my favorite actors, was believable.  You could tell from the first glimpse that Frodo was special; Wood's pale, sharp features contrast sharply with the more ruddy, robust look of the rest of the hobbits.  He also cries like a little girl.  But his weaknesses and strengths make his Frodo an apt choice for the starring character.  The rest of the Hobbiton gang was well-chosen, too.  Sean Astin (""Rudy"" forever to me) was loyal and a bit bumbling, just like the Gamgee of Tolkien's telling.  Pippin and Merry were congenial, slow-witted lads, but very brave nonetheless.  Viggo Mortensen is outstanding.  He has the ability to make Aragorn both menacing and kind. He physically represents Strider to the nines with his strength and virility; the action sequences of his are very passionate and exciting.  Some may have complained about Arwen's character being slightly expanded; I thought it a good change.  In the books, you have to read the whole trilogy and then rifle through the appendix in ""The Return of the King"" to learn the history between Aragorn and Arwen.  Liv Tyler is ethereal and breathtaking, but at the same time displays the courage and magic that make the Elves the beings they are.  Speaking of Elves, I can't help but gush over the handsome and ever-so-talented Orlando Bloom as noble Legolas.  Bloom captured the archer's very movements; he treads lightly and fights fearlessly. Legolas's bowmanship was amazing; he looked so natural loosing his arrows machine-gun style.  He was my favorite character in the books, and his essence transcends the film.  Gimli was pompous and brave, as well.  He is well-represented in the movie.  Boromir was hopelessly lost, but at the same time valiant and strong.  Sean Bean gave an emotionally-charged performance as the tortured warrior.  Hugo Weaving was very good as Elrond.  He was noble and cold at the same time.  And Gandalf.  What more can be said of Ian McKellan's showcase portrayal of the wizard?  He was magnificent.  He could be Gandalf, the kind old conjurer who set off pyrotechnics for hobbit-children.  Then he could turn around and stun the life out of you with Gandalf the powerful wizard, facing the balrog with defiance and an iron will.  His Oscar nomination is well-deserved.Peter Jackson is a brave soul to take on a project that could have backfired in so many places.  Instead of bringing us uninspired kitsch, he serves up raw emotion, graphic battles of good and evil, chilling and wonderful characters, and enough special effects (realistic, mind you) to make John Cameron's mouth water.  Knowing that ""The Two Towers"" was my favorite of the books, I eagerly anticipate the second helping of ""The Lord of the Rings."""
"4116","The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring",10,"One of the greatest films of all time.","Star Wars has been dethroned.  Although George Lucas' movies are good in their own right (except for the juvenile elements he puts in to sell toys to finance the franchise), his scripts (which borrow heavily from J.R.R.Tolkien, mythology & religion) can't compare with the brilliance of the literary trilogy `The Lord of the Rings'.  Granted, Lucas took on a herculean task in writing & directing his story himself, but Tolkien's words, along with Peter Jackson's faithful adaptation & inspired vision, have created something no one man could equal. Of course, it helps that Jackson insisted on at least a 2 picture deal, & New Line Cinema was brave enough to foot the bill up front for 3 movies. They spent $180 million to film all 3 simultaneously.  With the New Zealand exchange rate, that equals $360 million ($90 million ea.), but since they used many of the same sets, and FX development costs were spread throughout, we're seeing $120-$150 million on the screen.  This will ensure consistency in plot, casting, tone, etc.In 3 hours, Jackson has crammed everything essential from the first novel & then some into the film, rewriting some scenes & dialogue with lesser characters for the leads, leaving out only what there wasn't enough time for.  Basically, you have two 90 min. movies running back to back.  There are no slow spots, just one climax after another.  From the opening 10 min. backstory where the Dark Lord Sauron is shown on the battlefield wiping out men & elves 10 at a time with each swing of his mace, I was blown away.  The romance between Aragorn, king in exile, and Arwen, daughter of the elf-lord, is played up for the ""Titanic"" quotient, but it's well done. The story, sets, costumes & FX are so rich, you'll have to see the film several times to absorb everything.  The unspoiled New Zealand locales are spectacular, providing a variety of environments to represent the different settings on the characters' journey.  The location sets are imaginative, detailed & weathered, adding to their believability, while the studio sets match them in meticulousness.  The costumes are at once familiar & strange, drawing on both the medievil & the fantastic, but more important, they're also functional & practical.  The music by Howard Shore is appropriately sweeping, Celtic & folky in keeping with the novel, although it lacks the memorable themes of John Williams or Jerry Goldsmith, but neither would commit a year or more to a 3 picture project.  The FX are as they should be, unobtrusive & unnoticed most of the time, there only to support the story not draw attention away from it as in most Hollywood movies which try to coverup illogical plots & bad acting. I'm particularly gratified by the casting of Viggo Mortenson as Aragorn which was a last minute stroke of luck when the actor first chosen for the part backed out due to differences with the director.  I've always thought Mortenson had an intensity & striking but not pretty-boy looks that could portray a flawed, dangerous hero instead of the villains Hollywood always picked him for.A stellar cast giving some of their best performances, visuals that deliver beyond what I imagined, a perfect mix of humor, passion & tragedy, and a feeling of grandeur, scope & impending doom.  Perhaps as an ensemble piece with so many characters & the inability to concentrate on any one, it can't be measured against some of the classic character study films, but even the casual moviegoer can grasp the ideas & not get lost  As far as I'm concerned, it's one of the greatest films of all time."
"4117","The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring",10,"Details!","I think I can watch this film a billion times and not get bored. Today I saw LOTR for the third time and I noticed a few details.When Frodo is stabbed with the blade from the dark rider and the hobbits and Aragorn are in the forrest u can see 3 huge stone trolls in the background. To understand who they are you have to read The hobbit. - When the fellowship is traveling over the mountains everyone is walking IN the snow, except for Legolas who is walking ON the snow. The is because Elves are so light.Well when I saw these details I realised that Peter Jackson was even a greater director then I thought. And for the people who think that there are too much 'ring-shots' (sounds like a word from a porn movie) in the movie: THE MOVIE IS CALLED THE LORD OF THE RINGS GODDAMMIT, THE RING IS THE MOST IMPORTANT THING IN THE ENTIRE MOVIE! Some say that the movie is too long. It may be long but I never ever get bored watching. This movie is just brilliant, mayB just as brilliant as the book."
"4118","The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring",10,"Don't care what the Academy says, Best film of 2001 and best of many others.","LOTR is without a doubt, the best movie I've ever seen. I don't care what the Academy says because without a doubt, it was the best film of 2001 (obviously... i said it was the best movie I've ever seen). It deserved the Academy Award 10 times more than A Beautiful Mind did. I mean look at the difference between ratings. LOTR: #3 ABM: #126 See a difference? LOTR will go on to be an unforgotten movie as what Star Wars is. In twenty years ABM won't even be on the top 250 list, while LOTR will still be in the top 50. SO LOTR fans just remember. Academy doesn't mean sh*t. Time says it all."
"4119","The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring",10,"Part One: With Help, Even the Impossible Can Be Achieved","Peter Jackson set out to make movies which the author of the Lord of the Rings trilogy, J.R.R. Tolkien would have endorsed. All three were resounding successes, though because of the film medium they necessarily varied from Tolkien's story-line. Purists may have issues with Jackson's theatrical license, but as someone who has read Tolkien's books several times and seen the films 4-5 times each, I never felt that Jackson went too far or compromised Tolkien's story, the mythology he developed or the wonderful characters he brought to life. Many have said what Jackson did could not be done. He has not only proved the nay-sayers wrong, but lovingly crafted a set of films which will, for many decades to come, stand out as a great achievement. This is the first of three reviews I am publishing on IMDb for these films. I am labeling them Parts 1, 2, and 3 just in case anybody wants to read them in order. The reviews will be self-contained, but will also be enhanced by a chronological reading. My reviews will focus on the extended edition DVDs, though my comments are also relevant to the theatrical releases.The Fellowship of the Ring introduces the key characters and the broad story arc of the Lord of the Rings trilogy. Wizard Gandalf the Grey travels to a small town for small people (Hobbits)to help celebrate Bilbo Baggins' birthday. The very elderly Baggins doesn't look a day over 45, and soon it becomes apparent why. Since the great adventure of his life, a quest he was sent on by Gandalf himself, he has possessed the most powerful object in all of Middle Earth <U+0096> The One Ring. This ring is evil incarnate, with an insatiable lust for power, it taints every creature who possesses it and tries to work its way back to its creator <U+0096> Dark Lord Sauron. Bilbo uses the ring to disappear, as he intends to spend his senescence with his friends the Elves in Rivendell. But activating the ring, he draws the attention of Lord Sauron from thousands of miles away in the land of Mordor. Realizing what has occurred, Gandalf scrambles to determine a course of action and recruits Bilbo's nephew Frodo and his loyal gardener Samwise to bear the ring to the Council of Elrond in Rivendell. Thusly, the seeds of the fellowship are planted in the soil of the Shire.At this point, we are about 1/6th of the way through The Fellowship. Fairly soon thereafter, it becomes clear who will compose the fellowship, and who and what these people are. Though the succeeding films are not entitled ""Fellowship"", they follow the adventures of the surviving central characters. Characterization is done just as Tolkien did it in the original novel <U+0096> by example not discourse. For example, we are given hints to the identity of Strider (Mortenson) earlier on in the movie than in the novel, but the actual significance of this remains ambiguous until about midway through. Strong characterization is key to the success of the entire trilogy. To summarize, Peter Jackson, his team and cast <U+0096> NAIL the characterization. The casting and acting is perfect. It is very difficult to resist the temptation to single out Mortenson and McKellen for carrying their difficult roles so well (Strider/Aragorn and Gandalf), but why risk diminishing the contributions of the rest of the cast? Nobody mis-steps, and it is clear from the beginning that the entire cast was thoroughly and completed engaged with the task before them.Tolkien believed that no film would ever do his work justice, and until this trilogy, he was correct.Peter Jackson and his team have managed to do exactly what they set out to. As Jackson himself has said in reference to the film trilogy, they set out to 'make Tolkien's film.' Jackson successfully drew out elements of all three books, expanding and contracting, rearranging, and sometimes adding whole subplots which are hinted at in the books, but not well explained, in order to adopt the grand story to the film medium. Arwen (Liv Tyler), daughter of Elrond and Elven lover of Aragorn, for example, is introduced early in the films and plays a role in the films which is much more equal to her significance than it was in the books.The Howard Shore score is lovely, and its simple themes are used to great effect throughout all three movies. The musical collaborations improvising on Shore's basic themes are great, and, though they feature some prominent performers <U+0096> are never weighed down by star-power.Jackson made all three movies simultaneously. This technique allowed for perfect continuity, and permitted much greater flexibility in editing and post-production work than would normally be allowed. Knowing that he would need to establish and support his own fellowship to make this production work, he also knew that success would make the production legendary. So, he documented the creation of the films beautifully. Two complete DVDs full of documentary pieces are included in all three Special Edition Packages in the trilogy. Many are likely to be bored by the details in these documentaries, but those interested in the creative process behind the films will be provided with a more comprehensive view than I can remember ever seeing in any similar DVD package. The Fellowship of the Rings is as true a representation of Tolkien's novel as can be imagined. Although some aspects of the stories in the novel were adapted to the screen, the essentials, the characters, and the overall story are not just recognizable, but ENHANCED by the film. What results is a film that is not just entertaining, but an enormous fulfillment of an undying wish of millions of fans around the world.Very highly recommended."
"4120","The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring",10,"An Amazing Achievement","'The Lord of the Rings' is one of my favorite books, I have read it several times, and remember thinking the last time, about 3 years ago that if I made a film I'd want to make it of this, but wouldn't it be almost impossible. You can then imagine how strong my expectations were when I went to see the eagerly awaited first installment.This film impressed me hugely, more than anything else because of how true it was to my imagination, both in the characters as well as in the effects and setting- a sentiment I have heard consistently from other fans of the books. Elijah Wood brought across the character of Frodo with the kind of haunted, frail courage that Tolkien captures so well in the books. Nor could I find any fault at all with Ian McKellan's Gandalf, Viggo Mortensen's Aragorn, and Sean Bean's Boromir, all of whom I thought were portrayed excellently. I could pick out instances where I did think, 'no, that's not right', however their seldomness in number would only serve to illustrate the excellence of the overall portrayal. One thing that did stand out for me was Cate Blanchett's performance as Galadriel, the part itself became so perfunctory in the film that to me her alternation between benevolent seer, and figure of potential terror seemed little more than a slightly confusing detour with no real connection into the plot other than as a vehicle for a glimpse into the future. But that was it.I thought that the points where Jackson did deviate from the text were completely the correct ones to do so. Shortening the opening Shire scenes and cutting out the whole Tom Bombadil bit was great since frankly they bored me slightly in the book anyway. Also, expanding the role of Arwen was a sensible decision.However this film is by no means above criticism. The dialogue was in my opinion terrible and purely there to drive on the plot. Normally this would ruin a film for me (as in ""The Matrix""), making it almost intolerable to view, however fortunately here it proves little more than a minor irritation. Also, the film seemed overall to be excessively plot-driven and at times a mad dash from one action scene to another, the characters, for all their truth to the book did seem flat and sometimes little more than stereotypical fantasy characters. This is perhaps my major quarrel with the film- I would have liked these characters to have come alive as people in a way that was made impossible by the sparseness of the script and the rollercoaster nature of the plot. In general the whole film lacked the depth of context that I think distinguishes Tolkien from other fantasy writers. However to have achieved this would have required a very different movie, and you can't fault an action film for being an action film.This movie is undoubtedly not for everyone. A lot of people just don't get fantasy- other than Lord of the Rings, I don't particularly either. However in my opinion Jackson really has made an incredible achievement- his and Tolkien's vision carried through suberbly by a breathtaking setting and stunning special effects, as well as by a cast clearly as enthralled as he was. He has taken on a huge task, and is dealing with it with breathtaking success. Check for other user comments."
"4121","The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring",10,"A truly exceptional film","There is very little that can be said about The Lord of the Rings that hasn't been said already many times over. But what can be re-iterated is that The Fellowship of the Ring is an outstanding piece of film-making.Where do you start when reviewing a film the size of Lord of the Rings? J.R.R. Tolkein's seminal masterwork, long considered unfilmable, has made it on to the screen thanks to visionary director Peter Jackson. The Fellowship of the Ring is the first of the three books of the trilogy. Everyone has their favourite of the three, and this one is probably mine. Unrivalled in its size and scale by virtually any other film, with new groundbreaking special and digital effects, a stunning musical score, universally superb acting and most importantly a superb story.The Fellowship of the Ring is the first part of the epic trilogy that tells of the quest of a hobbit to destroy an evil ring of power. He is aided in his quest by his friends and other companions who accompany him and protect him on his journey. Many threats face him on his long journey, both from the world around him and from his companions, who could be tempted by the power of the ring he has set out to destroy. It is a tale of magic and fantasy, swords and sorcery, but it is not simply for teens who enjoy dungeons and dragons games. It is accessible to everyone. By turns exciting, frightening, funny and sad, it is a true masterpiece in terms of storytelling, encompassing the full spectrum of emotions.The acting is superb from the entire cast, and it is unfathomable as to how the Academy overlooked the acting entirely for all three films when dishing out awards and nominations. However the performances from Ian McKellan, Viggo Mortensen, Sean Astin, Elijah Wood and Sean Bean are all so good it would have possibly been greatly unfair to single any one out for an award.The film also contains some groundbreaking computer-generated special effects, and some positively genius scale work. Due to hobbits being only about 3 feet tall, some clever scale work was needed in order to ensure that John Rhys-Davies, a dwarf in the film but over 6 feet tall in real life, did in fact look the height of a dwarf. This was done through clever use of forced perspectives, scale doubles, giant sets and blue screen filming. However, the most impressive use of computer effects lies later in the trilogy, with the appearance of Gollum <U+0096> cinema's first live-action character who is completely computer generated. The music is also beautiful, and Howard Shore has created possibly the most iconic and memorable score since John Williams' Star Wars.Peter Jackson has, until Lord of the Rings, been seen as a director outside of the mainstream, but his superb, career-defining work on the Lord of the Rings trilogy has seen him well and truly propelled him to the forefront of Hollywood. He has re-defined the epic film with unparalleled success, and created films that will definitely stand the test of time, to one day be thought of with the same reverence as the Star Wars and Godfather trilogies.A major milestone in cinema history, the trilogy would eventually gain seventeen Oscars between the three films. Lord of the Rings is a master class in storytelling, and essential viewing."

I had never read the books upon seeing the film and was a little sceptical about what many people were claiming that it would change the way films were made.  Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring has become my favorite movie of all time.  And I have seen a lot of freaking movies.Every aspect of the film works.  The cast works their respective roles to perfection with Ian McKellen(Gandalf), Elijah Wood(Frodo), Viggo Mortensen(Aragorn), Sean Bean(Boromir), and Sean Astin(Sam) being the standouts.  From the epic prologue of the film you realize that there is a great, epic journey ahead of you.  And along the way you meet and care for every single character in the film.Director Peter Jackson has really crafted a beautiful piece of work that will be remembered for ages.  It's a perfect balance of action and great character moments.  Character development is not sacrificed for more action like so many other films of its like.  There are many moments of the film that make you realize this is more than just your typical fantasy film, moments that transcend filmmaking and have a profound effect on you. The last 30 minutes are particularly powerful and moving.Basically, this film is an epic, incredible experience.  A film that will be looked at years down the road as a great piece of filmmaking.  If you're a fan of good fantasy, or if you're just a fan of great movies, you'll love this film, plain and simple."
"4123","The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring",10,"A sight to behold","Growing up, my dad would always tell me his favorite books were The Lord of the Rings volumes.  But I was never interested in fantasies, so I didn't really care.  Then I found out that Peter Jackman was making the movies so I told my dad.  He became really excited.  But still, I didn't care.  Until one night in November, when they showed the LOTR special on TV.  I was able to catch only the first ten, fifteen minutes and instantly, I wanted to see the movie.  I had never read the books.  My dad took me and my family to see the movie.  I was a bit excited and curious to see how they would do it. Mind you, I knew next to nothing about this story.I sat through the entire three hours in Middle Earth and fell in love with it. Through parts, I would clutch on my brother's arm, tense and hoping that everyone will make it through a lot of the sticky situations they were in. I fell in love with Legolas and his graceful Elf self.  The minute the movie began, I was drawn in.  The special effects were terrific.  I felt like I was there.  I wanted (and still do) to live in Rivendell among the Elves. The backdrops for the movies was fantastic.  Sir Ian McKellan's quote about how New Zealand is Middle Earth is so true.I was very impressed with the casting.  I'm a huge movie buff so I have seen plenty of movies and I won't be lying when I say that LOTR has the best casting ever.  Every person, the mains and the extras, WAS the character they played.  The make-up was incredible.  The orcs creeped me out.  The Elves entranced me.  The Hobbits brought a smile to my face.  Elrond, Hugo Weaving, is the perfect Elf King, firm and commanding, yet with love for his people and respect for Frodo.  I could go on and on, but I won't.I loved the fact how PJ was able to make the Hobbits look small in every single scene.  I would LOVE to know HOW in the world they did that.  I love how the Elves are so graceful and look ethereal.I know that the movie is three hours long and people balk at that.  I took a friend of mine who hasn't seen the movie because it was three hours long. He loved it.  He was engrossed and he had never read the book either. This movie is one of the, if not THE, finest piece of work I have seen.  I eagerly await ""The Two Towers"" and ""The Return of the King"".  I definitely recommend this movie for everyone to see at least once.  I have seen it four times and will see it yet again soon.  I can never get bored of this movie. Go.  See it.I leave you with a quote from Gandalf: ""All we have to decide is what to do with the time that we are given"""
"4124","The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring",NA,"An amazing achievement","'The Lord of the Rings' is one of my favorite books, I have read it several times, and remember thinking the last time, about 3 years ago that if I made a film I'd want to make it of this, but wouldn't it be almost impossible. You can then imagine how strong my expectations were when I went to see the eagerly awaited first installment. This film impressed me hugely, more than anything else because of how true it was to my imagination, both in the characters as well as in the effects and setting- a sentiment I have heard consistently from other fans of the books. Elijah Wood brought across the character of Frodo with the kind of haunted, frail courage that Tolkien captures so well in the books. Nor could I find any fault at all with Ian McKellan's Gandalf, Viggo Mortensen's Aragorn, and Sean Bean's Boromir, all of whom I thought were portrayed excellently. I could pick out instances where I did think, 'no, that's not right', however their seldomness in number would only serve to illustrate the excellence of the overall portrayal. One thing that did stand out for me was Cate Blanchett's performance as Galadriel, the part itself became so perfunctory in the film that to me her alternation between benevolent seer, and figure of potential terror seemed little more than a slightly confusing detour with no real connection into the plot other than as a vehicle for a glimpse into the future. But that was it.I thought that the points where Jackson did deviate from the text were completely the correct ones to do so. Shortening the opening Shire scenes and cutting out the whole Tom Bombadil bit was great since frankly they bored me slightly in the book anyway. Also, expanding the role of Arwen was a sensible decision. However this film is by no means above criticism. The dialogue was in my opinion terrible and purely there to drive on the plot. Normally this would ruin a film for me (as in ""The Matrix""), making it almost intolerable to view, however fortunately here it proves little more than a minor irritation. Also, the film seemed overall to be excessively plot-driven and at times a mad dash from one action scene to another, the characters, for all their truth to the book did seem flat and sometimes little more than stereotypical fantasy characters. This is perhaps my major quarrel with the film- I would have liked these characters to have come alive as people in a way that was made impossible by the sparseness of the script and the rollercoaster nature of the plot. In general the whole film lacked the depth of context that I think distinguishes Tolkien from other fantasy writers. However to have achieved this would have required a very different movie, and you can't fault an action film for being an action film. This movie is undoubtedly not for everyone. A lot of people just don't get fantasy- other than Lord of the Rings, I don't particularly either. However in my opinion Jackson really has made an incredible achievement- his and Tolkien's vision carried through suberbly by a breathtaking setting and stunning special effects, as well as by a cast clearly as enthralled as he was. He has taken on a huge task, and is dealing with it with breathtaking success."
"4125","The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring",10,"A Masterpiece","I've never been a fan of the sword and sorcery genre . I'm surprised film companies decide to make rubbish like THE BEASTMASTER, HAWK THE SLAYER and RED SONJA but I am aware of the popularity of JRR Tolkien's massive novel LORD OF THE RINGS and of it's popularity , I remember in a survey carried out by a very well known British fantasy/SF magazine in 1987 Tolkien's book was voted the greatest fantasy novel of all time ( THE STAND by Stephen King was a long way second ) , but it's a novel that has always struck me as being read by anoraks who - like fans of STAR TREK and STAR WARS - insist on reading subtexts that are just not there . When the THE FELLOWSHIP OF THE RINGS shot to number one in the IMDb top 250 films I put the popularity down to obsessed anorakish fans who were going to vote the film a classic no matter what . Stranger still I found groups as diverse as neo Nazis to gays to enviromentalists proclaiming "" This is our film "" so when I finally sat down to watch TFOTR I was expecting only some average entertainment for a non sad person with no political axe to grind . After seeing the film I had to admit THE FELLOWSHIP OF THE RING is a masterpiece .Much of the credit must go to the producers . I 've no idea of the politics about bringing the story to the silver screen but I can imagine the Hollywood bigwigs sitting around the commitee table saying "" Give us Tom , give us Nicole , get Harrison , get Leonardo . No limeys . Limeys are slimy . No limey accents . We're Americans , this is our baby "" to which the producers gave a firm and resounding "" No "" . Good for them because the Hollywood treatment would have ruined this film. The cast comprised of well known - but not megastar - actors and unknowns are uniformally excellent even the normally hammy Lee and Rhys Davis and the bland Tyler are good . Also great to see so many Brits playing good guys and having the American actors adopting non specific British accents .The cast do a good jobThe other production values are outstanding . Pride of place goes to Andrew Lesnie's cinematography where the camera sweeps down from the sky into the Orcs underground lair and the camera also shows off the stunning New Zealand landscapes . I'd always believed Scotland had the greatest scenery on Earth but I'm willing to change my mind . The FX are good throughout though perhaps the matte backgrounds and CGI are less impressive in places but they're still a lot better than we've been used to recently . The Orc make up is wonderful and helps them become classic cinema monsters . The only bad point about the Orcs is - Like the stormtroopers in STAR WARS - they're too easy to kill .There are some minor flaws to THE FELLOWSHIP OF THE RINGS but this is probably down to Tolkien's source novel rather than the film makers . A couple of times the heroes seem set to suffer a resounding defeat when something not obvious at first like flammable villains or a giant eagle saves the day . I guess this is cancelled out by the dangers and adversaries also appearing from nowhere and there's little female perspective in the story for the women in the audience to relate to but come on girls you've got Viggo Mortensen and Sean Bean acting all hunky and macho so you can't complain.I see the IMDb reviewers have started a backlash against FOTR like they did with TITANIC and GLADIATOR . They're right about the gawd awful rubbish that is TITANIC but they're wrong about GLADIATOR which is a very good film and even further wrong about THE FELLOWSHIP OF THE RING which is a cinematic masterpiece. Ignore their criticisms . Any film that is praised by people as diverse as fans of the book , people who have never read the book , enviromentalists and cynics like myself is worth your time watching . I'm really looking forward to THE TWO TOWERS"
"4126","The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring",9,"A Glorious Vision of Middle Earth","The reason why this first part of Jackson's 'Lord of the Rings' is superior to his latter two parts is because of restraint. Jackson was restrained from over doing it with the CGI and ""epic"" battle sequences, which in my opinion does not make a story epic. Part of the reason was simply because Tolkien did not have very many battles in the first part of his book, which thankfully forced Jackson to focus on creating a believable world rather than a believable hack-n-slash action movie.I don't find much entertainment in watching people mutilate each other, but I love it when a movie engages me in a world, and 'The Fellowship of the Ring' does just that. Certainly the most breathtaking scenes in the movie are the moments of patient observation, when the camera pans around and captures the beautiful settings of Middle Earth. I must give Jackson credit. He did hire some very extraordinary artists that have envisioned one of the grandest interpretations of Tolkien's world.There are about five particular moments that stick out in my mind and gave me that tingle of goosebumps down my spine when I saw them for the first time. The first is the introduction to Hobbiton. After the somewhat awkward prologue, I was beginning to have my doubts to whether the movie would live up to the book. But the movie surprised me. Hobbiton is perfect. The houses have flower patches and old fences, the roads look worn and made through decades of travel, and the Old Mill spins with the laziness of a quiet town. Every color is vibrant and every moment looks as through it was taken out of a picture book. Although I still don't agree with the particular look of the Hobbits, I believe everything else in Hobbiton is worthy of Tolkien's words.The second moment comes after Frodo's awakening in Rivendell, and the third, during the exploration of the Halls of Moria. In both moments, the camera pans away from the characters and outward into a static shot of their surroundings. The moments make us feel like we're turning our heads and gazing at the world around us just as the characters do. The golden waterfalls of the elven city mark an interesting contrast with the dark halls of the dwarfish mines, but each are inspiring in their own ways and add to feeling of being engaged in a living world.My other favorite moments come during the exploration of Lothlorien and the passage down the Anduin. And while I won't go into detail about the scenes, since they really should be experienced without any prior expectations, they are monuments in imaginative cinema. 'The Fellowship of the Ring' is one of those rare movies that I always wish I could reexperience for the first time. Unfortunately, Jackson turned away from exploring Middle Earth in his next two movies, and instead, turned to fighting and warfare. He seems to take a lot of pride in the love story and battle sequences he created in 'The Two Towers' and 'The Return of the King,' but it is was in his first movie when he really got it right. In 'The Fellowship of the Ring,' it's okay if the characters are uninteresting and have silly dialogue. Middle Earth is the star, and the characters are the ones seeing it for the first time."
"4127","The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring",10,"Brilliant and Intelligent","For those of you like myself who are fans of the books of the same name,you will not be disappointed by this movie. Unlike the animated versions that have previously been made where much of the story was condensed either for budgetary constraints or time limits, the Fellowship of the Ring while it does take a few shortcuts, there are very few. It is very exciting getting to see places that up until now have been purely figments of my imagination portrayed by someones elses imagination on the silver screen. I felt myself holding my breath waiting to see the various locations of middle earth and how others have dreamed of them. The movie does a breathtaking job in transporting the viewer to this other world and does so with magic good enough to be from the hand of Gandalf himself. Yes, there are places where for dramatic reasons or to prevent a lengthy historical context that certain events from the book were either shortened, modified or changed. These changes however do not change the storyline itself and makes for a very entertaining movie. I do feel however that if you are one of the uninitiated, it would serve you to either read the book before going, or immediately after the film pick up a copy and read it as it will provide more breadth to the story than what an almost three hour film can portray. In addition, there are several scenes in the book that while not central to the main story, add more to the lore of middle earth and help to explain some of the history leading up to the time of the story. The characterizations in the film were very well done and the choices of the actors to play the hobbits were perfect. While I was somewhat anxious to have Elijah Wood as Frodo and Sean Astin as Samwise, after seeing how well they were portrayed on film left me no doubt that these actors did a very admirable job bringing the characters to life. The majority of the cast has some English accent which was my main concern. Both the principle American actors portrayed a passable English type accent themselves which helped prevent them standing out on their own. How the filmmakers made several average height men such as Wood and Astin, and probably more so John Rhys Davies as Gimli appear much smaller than their Elvish or human companions is spellbinding. Special effects in this movie while at first don't really seem to be that obvious eventually take on a more obvious tone as the fellowship moves further into the adventure. As one would expect from a magical world, many things which we take for granted from reading the books are very difficult to accurately portray in a live action presentation. The filmmakers not only did a good job, they surpassed by far my expectations and truly made the experience an enjoyable and fulfilling one. As with any film where there will be sequels coming out, the ending left me longing for December 2002 to follow our adventurers further on their quest.I will caution parents who are thinking of taking their children to see this movie that it is not a movie made or intended for children. Much Parental Guidance and forethought should be taken before taking children under 12 to this film. Aside from a film which lasts almost three hours in length where much of the dialogue while important to the story is not well suited to entertain small children. In addition, several of the creatures created for the film will probably terrify younger audiences. If you want to take your children to see this film, I might caution you to view it without them first and then decide to take them on your own judgement. Hey, if you do see it first without them, you can see it again right? I plan on seeing it more than once anyway. All in all, this is a well developed motion picture where a great deal of thought went into it's development and execution. I am thankful to the filmmakers for having the courage to tackle such a well known, well loved story with an audience that has a very well organized preconceived notion of how they view the world of Tolkien. The filmmakers did the book justice and that is the bottom line unlike Bakshi's version of 1978 which was a disappointment at best and unfinished as it's final release turned out to be."
"4128","The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring",10,"An Excellent Movie Choice!","I absolutely love this movie, partly because the acting is really good, but also for the CGI effects and the good storyline. I watched the extended version and realized that it isn't boring like some people think because some people I know think that FOTR is quite a lengthy movie because of all the talking, but in my opinion, if there's not talking, there's no story! If they just jumped to the fighting scenes without any of the introduction, then you won't know where the movie started from. I love the scenes where they get to fight, whether Orcs or Nazgul, the fighting scenes are still the climax of the movie.Another good movie to see after FOTR is TTT, of course. It is the second part of this great trilogy and there are more climatic scenes. Most probably, you'll enjoy that more than FOTR but don't shun this movie just because it's a bit lengthy.Overall, it's a great movie to see and it is really worth spending the money to buy/rent the extended/special DVD to watch too. Definitely a 10 out of 10 on my scale! Actually, in my opinion, 10/10 doesn't even come close!"
"4129","The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring",10,"W.O.W.","WOW!! First off, those who complain about the film...ARE YOU NUTS?!?! Films are merely forms of entertainment remember? And this film was very entertaining. The special effects were EXCELLENT!! I have to admit; I fell in love with a couple of actors after watching this movie. Hugo Weaving - always a favourite - made a delicious elf, as did Orlando Bloom. YUMMY!! Ian McKellen was lovely as Gandalf the Grey - GOOD MOVE! And Christopher Lee was really creepy as Saruman the White, but then again, isn't he always?Now to those who say that this movie has no plot, are you people blind? The plot is right there!! I'll spell it out for you. *Old hobbit (Bilbo) has evil ring, bequeaths it to young hobbit nephew (Frodo) *Frodo and 3 hobbit friends (Merry, Pippin and Samwise) directed by wizard Gandalf to embark on a journey to Rivendale (home of yummy elves) to give ring to elves for safekeeping. Unfortunately, no go. *4 hobbits continue journey with other members of fellowship of ring (Gandalf, Aragorn, Legolas, Gimli and Sauron) *Encounter danger *One dies *Journey to be continued in next movie Very basic, and I've probably left out a lot, but there you go.I really enjoyed this movie like you wouldn't believe - how DID ""A Beautiful Mind"" beat it? (Mind you, Russell Crowe is a pretty solid actor.) As a fantasy movie it rivals ""Harry Potter"", I loved it that much. (And I LOVED ""Harry Potter"" - especially Alan Rickman as Professor Severus Snape) All I have left to say is: 2 thumbs up; 10/10; ***** out of *****."
"4130","The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring",10,"Excusable flaws don't detract.","There's a very obvious problem when transferring any book to the big screen, namely that some of us may already have seen it. It's not that the story holds no surprises (save for the occasional controversies that surround the fate of characters like Hannibal Lecter), it's just that many of us have already read the book, and thus we've already directed our own version of the story. We've already seen it in our mind's eye. And this is the problem that plagues The Fellowship of The Ring. You'll see a lot of reviews here proclaiming it as nothing short of the second coming of cinema, and a few that dare to knock its serious shortcomings. Let me clear this up right now. The first issue that many may raise is that this is not a faithful adaptation of the book. Quite right, while taking pains to ensure that they stayed faithful to the novel, Jackson et al have not simply been able to lift their screenplay directly from its pages without a few necessary changes. There is a great deal of mindfulness in the film about the portion of the audience (and it will be large) who are unfamiliar with the novels.Accordingly a great deal more emphasis has been placed upon pacing and storytelling more appropriate to a classic film narrative. Hence we need to see Gandalf's protracted bid to escape the clutches of Isenguard interspersed with the Hobbit's journey to Rivendell. It simply isn't appropriate to expect an audience to bear with the Hobbits' journey, no matter how good the actors are or how enthralling the story is, for upwards of an hour without constant reminders of the films other protagonists OR the threat of the evil they face. Having Gandalf just turn up at Rivendell and tell his story via CGI-filled flashbacks simply wouldn't have had the necessary effect. Secondly, the omission and reworking of characters. Yes, it was sad that Bakshi felt his animation didn't need Tom Bombadill, and given that he features strongly in Tolkien's other works this has to be frowned upon by the die-hard fanatics, but introducing diverting, but ultimately pointless episodes into the list of the challenges the Hobbits face is hardly going to keep you riveted to your seat is it? I mean, a man who stops the Hobbits being eaten, very slowly, by a tree with his power of song is just quite frankly ludicrous in this day and age. The film is already stretching the audience's suspension of disbelief as far as it can go. Hence the chaff of Bombadill is cut. He isn't relevant to the rest of the story so he can be done without. It's sad for Tolkien fans for him not to be there but there's only so much celluloid available, even with a film this long. And yes, Arwen Undomiel never saved Frodo from the Dark Riders, but please, remember your girlfriend needs to have something to sink her teeth into as well, not just midgets and men with beards looking mean or scared as they fight monsters. So, for gender representation and a bid to prevent half the potential market (please remember that like all film, this is a product to be packaged and sold) her character gets a drastic overhaul. Go sister! There are numerous other issues relevant to the faithfulness of the adaptation from novel to screenplay but please, let's be content with what we've got here. It's a hard task to do all this well and Jackson, along with the rest of the boys and girls at Wingnut and WETA, should be commended for what they have achieved. That said there are some definite flaws in the film, even those that can't be overlooked by justifying the needs to relate to the popcorn and nachos audience. Firstly, we've got the Fellowship itself. Now, Merry and Pippin, while not really being established as Frodo's friends and thus not having the same kind of bond with him as they do in the novel are moderately well integrated. However, at the arrival of Boromir, Gimili and Legolas we just get left in the dark. None of these three characters, all representing important races, cultures and locations of the world of Middle Earth are given no more than token arrival-shots to introduce them, and little or no back-story as to how they came to be where they are or why they feel compelled to join Frodo's quest. Offering their various weapons is noble, and it sounds fantastic in the trailer, but when we finally get down to it we just don't know who they are or what they're about. Accordingly we don't ever really have time to care about any of these three, save for Legolas whose fighting proficiency alone makes him stand out. Sadly, Sean Bean is allowed little more than to switch from foreboding bad guy to friendly companion and back again (thus betraying his characters ultimate fate from the first time he opens his mouth) and John Rhys Davis is left with little more to do than scowl and look short. It doesn't help that both these characters seem to get a pretty raw deal for screen time, especially Gimli, who is barely in the film at all. We won't even begin to go into the seemingly superficial relationship we see between Sam and Frodo. All of this is indeed a shame. The film's greatest strength after its story are its strong characters. However, whereas in the book they have the space to develop and flesh themselves out here they have little more to do than look in awe at Gandalf, perhaps not with a humble air so much as a wonder that he's being allowed to soak up all the screen time. And yes, what you've heard is true; the fight sequences are shockingly bad. Well, perhaps that IS an overstatement. The fight sequences aren't exactly bad, they're riddled with good ideas and clever moves, but the camerawork and editing is so erratic that you'll have a hard time picking out anything to inspire awe or respect. The problem here is that the benchmarks for on screen fighting have all been established nowadays by The Matrix, Crouching Tiger and The Phantom Menace, and all of these films use lengthy shots to allow us to soak up the fight imaginative fight choreography, rather than have us crane our necks and dart about the screen with our eyeballs trying to glimpse it like a rare bird or nipple-flash at a premiere. Now, these, yet again, are only a few of the problems. There's the geography of Middle Earth, some ropey special effects moments and the clumsy ending to deal with. But you can read the books and see the film for yourself; I've already typed enough about all that here. BUT, now that I've just spent the main chunk of this review telling you about the shortcomings of The Fellowship of the Rings as both a movie and an adaptation let me tell you, it is good, exceptionally good. There is no denying that the storyline itself, acting, effects, props, sets and so on and so forth are all spot on. Visually the film is a triumph and WETA has now, without question placed itself ahead of Industrial Light and Magic in terms of industry leading special effects. There are bags of style to proceedings, with some sequences displaying the sheer amount of vision of the whole team to bring somewhat vague sections of the novel to life.All parts are played to perfection by the cast, and the casting is literally some of the best and most appropriate seen in years, none of this who-hot-and-who's-not Jerry Bruckheimer trash, it's a case of the best possible person for the part at every stage of the film. We'll give particular credit to Sir Ian Mckellan, Christopher Lee, Ian Holm and Elijah Wood again here. No doubt they've had scores of favourable and loving reviews already but these performances truly are worth mentioning just once again. The film is a masterpiece from start to finish. Yes, it does take perseverance, no it's not entirely faithful to Tolkien's work and there are some serious flaws, but in a year that has been so barren of even five decent mainstream movies I think it's safe to say that no matter when this film had been released it would have outshone its competitors."
"4131","The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring",10,"Excellent","Incredible adaptation of the first book of J.R.R. Tolkien's ""Lord of the Rings"" trilogy.  I'm not going to summarize the story--there's way to much going on.  All I'll say is they took a verry difficult book with a intricate plot and made it an exciting, totally accesible movie.  The film moves quickly (with a few slow spots--but that's to get in the plot) and there's a lot to take in, but I was never confused.  I should mention that I tried twice to read the books but found them too hard.The film looks magical--Middle Earth looks beautifully real.  All the special effects are great (the Ring Wraiths are downright terrifying--as they should be) and the action sequences are among the best I've ever seen--fast, long and breathtaking.  The film is long (2 hrs, 40 min) but the time flies by.  The only problem is that there's so much plot and action going on that you're exhausted by the end--but in a good way.With the exception of Viggo Mortensen (very wooden) all the actors are good--top honors go to Elijah Wood, Dominic Monaghan, Cate Blanchett, Liv Tyler and (especially) Ian McKellan.But the film is VERY violent (despite the PG-13 rating).  It deserves an R--this is NOT one for the kids.  Still, it's the best film of 2001.  SEE IT!!!!"
"4132","Jurassic Park",10,"Criminally Underrated By IMDb!","Simply one of the greatest films of all time. How on Earth it is only rated as 7.9/10 I'll never know.It has a great plot, structured of course around Michael Crichton's equally brilliant novel, and the graphics are absolutely superb. Jurassic Park, along with the sequel 'The Lost World: Jurassic Park', had Dinosaurs that were actually convincing. Of course, there was some artistic license involved - certain behaviours of the animals were exaggerated or entirely fabricated - but that in no way detracts from the film. They are certainly better than those in the comparably average third instalment in the franchise, 'Jurassic Park III'. Living in the 21st century (or 20th, as it were) this film gave us a recreation of these creatures that was genuinely believable.For all their fancy graphics and obscene budgets, films such as 'Avatar' will never compare to the likes of Jurassic Park."
"4133","Jurassic Park",10,"A Groundbreaking, Heart Stomping, Dino Sized film","In the year 1993, Hollywood saw something unlike anything else, the film Jurassic Park. Never before 1993 had dinosaurs been so breathtaking and realistic on the silver screen.The plot is very original. A group of scientists cloned dinosaurs, and are about to open an amusement park where people can see the dinosaurs. The creator John Hammond(Richard Attenborough) invites a group of people, along with his grandchildren, to see the dinos and enjoy a relaxing time at the park. Could anything go wrong, at the time it doesn't seem like it, but something else is going on. Employee Dennis Nedry is planning to steal dinosaur embryos. In order to do this, he causes a security breakdown so he can get the embryos and escape. He isn't the only one that can escape, as hungry dinos also escape. After this, everyone on the island is in danger, and loose dinosaurs are everywhere. That is where the fun in Jurassic Park comes in.This is an underrated movie according to the IMDb ratings. It isn't even in the top 250. Today, people don't appreciate it as much, mainly due to the fact that other movies like it have been made. Growing up in the 90's, this was one of my favorite movies. As a kid, I only watched it to see the dinosaurs, as I didn't understand a whole lot of it. Today, I realize how great the plotting and suspense are.This spawned two sequels. The second one wasn't bad, but the third wasn't very good. I would recommend seeing the second after this, but the third is passable.The story is great, how at first we see how the magic was created, and then later we see the magic turn into a disaster, in which everyone's life is at stake.The special effects are still good today, but they were revolutionary for back in 1993. The acting is good, and the ensemble cast is great. All of the action sequences are perfectly executed, creating plenty of suspense and tension.Younger kids may get scared by this, as I remember a lot of young kids being scared by it in 1993. If kids aren't scared by dinosaurs, they will probably enjoy the movie.I highly recommend Jurassic Park. It is quite underrated in my opinion, it deserves more credit than it gets.Watch this at all costs if you have somehow missed it and see what everyone was amazed about back in 1993.Enjoy"
"4134","Jurassic Park",10,"incredible movie","Even though it was adapted from a book, this unique story was destined to become an incredible film. Great casting, decent acting, great special effects, beautiful and perfect score by John Williams, incredible directing. I believe this movie has to be one of the greatest science fiction films ever made. Although not entirely true to the book, (though someone should never say a movie is not good because it is not exactly like the book because that really doesn't matter) Steven Spielberg made this story a landmark in special effects and a standard for thriller films to be compared to. It also contains some scenes that are instant classics, such as the first time they see the dinosaurs, the kitchen scene with the raptors, the end scene with the raptors and the T-Rex, the scene with the T-Rex and the kids in the jeep, and of course the scene where the T-Rex chases the jeep. I will keep this movie in my list of favorites and classics till the day i die."
"4135","Jurassic Park",NA,"One of the greatest films ever made.","I don't know why I loved this movie so much.  Maybe it was the utter amazement when I first saw the Brachiosaurus eat from a tree.  Or maybe it was my adrenaline rushing when two 12 year old were attacked by velociraptors.  It might possibly be the chills that went down my spine when the T-Rex first made his terrifying roar.  Whatever it was, it made me write this review.Allan Grant (Sam Neil) and Ellie (Laura Dern) are two successful paleontologists who are asked by a rich man John Hammond to come at his park for a major tour.  They agree and are taken to an island where ""Jurassic Park"" logos are everywhere.  The two paleontologists have no idea what they are getting themselves into.  The first dinosaur to make an apearance is the Brachiosaurus, which both of them are extrememly amazed by its giant apearance, and so is the audience.  What the two of them don't know is that there are much more terrifying and carnivorous dinosaurs who are about to escape and run loose....Directed by the mighty Steven Speilberg, Jurassic Park relied on more character development than any other creature-feature.  Usually you get second-rate actors who can't act, getting terrified by monsters that don't really exist.  Jurassic Park was the opposite.  It changed the way we looked at the world, and it will forever.  Based on the novel by Micheal Crichton, Jurassic Park was an amazing movie.From beginning to end, Jurassic Park bedazzled us with dinosaurs.  Dinosaurs that are EXTINCT.  There are a lot of cool cameos and the stars give great performances.  The whole family should watch this movie.  Not for the glossy title, but because of the dinosaurs.  I remember being a kid when I first watched it, and I remember loving this movie so bad.  The climax was excellent, and I am not saying what happens, unlike the sequel to this film (Jurassic Park 3).  A climax-less bad film, that was.  But this....this was magic.  And yes, it was a masterpiece.The magic of this film is what brought me into dinosaurs, too.  I had a ""Jurassic Park"" marathon today and I watched this movie, and I can still feel the magic.  You will feel the magic too once you see it.  I just have absolutely nothing to say except that Steven Speilberg will put a spell on you.  Even if you don't like creature-features, this movie will entertain you.  Steven Speilberg will take you to places that no one else ever will. And the ""life will find a way"" speech is here, ready to make someone feel that creating dinosaurs that have been extinct for millions of years is a good thing.Absolutely needless to say, Jurassic Park was a golden diamond.10/10 (One of the greatest films ever made)"
"4136","Jurassic Park",9,"Brilliant","What can I say? Jurassic Park is one of the most underrated movies ever. Yes, I did say underrated. True, it is the fourth highest grossing movie ever (for the time being) and was a motion picture bible for eight-year-olds across the country, but it has never been regarded as artistically superior. When, in reality, it is one of the most artistically inventive movies ever. It contains all of Spielberg's magical strokes of genius from fantastic art direction and wonderful camera techniques to astounding technical quality ( which comes from his well known control over technology). The minor flaws of a theme park are masterfully embedded into the art direction, script etc. and the acting is superb. This is one of the only movies I've seen with great acting by children. Spielberg's camera usage ranges from foreshadowing the appearance of dinosaurs with extreme up-angles to exquisitely composed scenes of the dinosaurs' ""interaction"" with the characters. Aside from technical quality, Jurassic Park bears powerful social messages of human intrusion and destruction of natural environment and the self-revering nature of man. Also, it had an undeniable effect on cinema being one of the first movies to use CGI at such a large scale. However, the most ingenious aspect of the film is the portrayal of the dinosaurs as animals rather than ruthless monsters. At many times throughout the movie, the humans are portrayed as antagonists and the respect and appreciation of the dinosaurs is wonderfully developed. And, best of all, like star wars you can analyze the movie all you want or just sit back and enjoy the ride."
"4137","Jurassic Park",NA,"exciting","JURASSIC PARK was the film that ignited my interest in filmmaking and drove me to get a degree in it, so I will always have a soft spot for it. I was eleven when I read the book, but all the technical stuff lost me and I never finished it. A couple years later when I heard the movie was coming out, I decided I would just see it instead. With advance tickets selling out fast, my mom was lucky enough to get some a few days before it's premiere. We stood in line for roughly thirty minutes before we finally got in. Even as the lights were dimming, I still had no idea what to expect. Within moments I was glued to my seat. The opening sequences remains one of my favorite scenes in any film and continues to give me goosebumps to this day. For the next two hours, I sat in my seat just staring at the screen as these marvelous, life-like creatures that were unlike anything I had ever seen before. The film was full of awe and scares. I walked out of the theater virtually trying to catch my breath. What a thrill ride the film had been, and I eventually went back and saw it a few more times. The film was a turning point in my life, as I said, because I walked out saying to myself, ""That's what I want to do."" Sure the characters aren't deep and the dialogue isn't great, but who cares when the film is this entertaining? The actors are good in their parts, especially the always great Sam Neill, and the dinosaurs are incredibly life-like. The action is great, and the pacing (after a slow start) is relentless. The film has a few continuity flaws, but none of them matter. This film is great entertainment."
"4138","Jurassic Park",10,"Groundbreaking!","This was obviously the most sophisticated portrayal of dinosaurs at the time, and it doesn't age a bit.  Sam Neill plays Dr Alan Grant, a paleontologist who is persuaded to check out Richard Attenborough's new theme park, only to find that he has managed to clone dinosaurs.  There is plenty of action, and the dinos look so real as to be positively scary!  Sam Neill puts in his usual incredibly brilliant performance, and you can really believe he is acting with the creatures!  Jeff Goldblum as usual seems to play himself, as Professor Ian Malcolm, an expert in chaos theory who is convinced the park is a bad idea.  The cast are amazing, the effects are amazing, this whole movie is amazing.  It doesn't get any better than this!"
"4139","Jurassic Park",9,"Life finds a way...","''Life, uh... finds a way.''One of the best & most iconic movie quotes of all times.I don't know what can I say about this movie that hasn't been said. Really...Considering this movie was made in 1993, visual effects are of incredible quality, as you see it better on blu-ray. When it comes to story, it's completely original, nearly flawless. I can't say too much about the acting. I believe acting is not the movie's strongest point. But still, it was enough for that movie. You don't need to be like Marlon Brando in a sci-fi movie about dinosaurs and has great visual & sound effects. The movie is very fun to watch.I also sensed a small message like, ''don't mess with nature''.Best thing about the movie (for me) was the score. Especially the ''Welcome to Jurassic Park'' scene. Of course we're talking about John Williams, the guy who wrote the theme for Star Wars, so that's not a surprise.Highly recommend it.9/10"
"4140","Jurassic Park",9,"As said, the Definitive blockbuster movie","What can be said about this movie that hasn't already been said? Who knows. We all know that this has some of the greatest special effects, even today. Also, if there's anything that can match the awesome T-Rex, it's the movie's musical score. I swear, listen to it more than once, and you're bound to see the movie yet again, if for that sole reason. It's that powerful. Oh sure, acting isn't this movie's strong suit, but who looks for acting in a Dinosaur thriller? Who?!Anyway, I think I've made my point. Jurassic Park: One of America's greatest classics. Steven Spielberg created magic with this movie. If you haven't seen it once, you haven't seen it at all."
"4141","Jurassic Park",10,"Welcome to Jurassic Park.... Noodles Review","Look up the word ""awe"" in the dictionary... ya know what you'll find? Jurassic Park. And now in 3D! Usually, I don't really like post- converted 3D in movies, but this one won me over. Ever since I was a little kid, I've always loved Jurassic Park (I think we all did) and I'd always heard that it was one of the best movie theater experiences ever. Unfortunately, I wasn't born when this originally came out so I never got the chance to experience that... until now! And damn, were they right when they said it was an awesome movie theater experience because it sure as hell is. It's so fun, engrossing, and thrilling to watch it on the big screen, with all the sound surrounding you (the sound in Jurassic Park has got to be some of the best sound in a movie ever). Jurassic Park is also one of the most monumental movies of all time. It defined CGI. The CGI and special effects in this movie still holdup today and are even better than most movies today.The story of Jurassic Park is that a really rich guy has cloned dinosaurs to make an amusement park full of living dinosaurs (you would do that if you could too). Because they are these live dinosaurs in the park, his investors say that he needs approval from experts, so he recruits Dr. Alan Grant (a paleontologist who is more or less the protagonist of the movie), Dr. Elli Sattler (a paleobotanist), and Dr. Ian Malcom (a mathematician who's character is pretty much the show stealer). Through a number of circumstances, the dinosaurs get loose and all hell breaks loose. Now, we have our movie being one of the most awe- inspiring movies ever; as well as being one of the most suspenseful movies ever. When the characters first enter Jurassic Park, you see the many dinosaurs in the distance and the theme (one of the greatest movie themes of all time) is playing in the background. Your jaw just drops. And the dinosaurs look awesome. Sometimes they're CGI, sometimes they're animatronic. Sometimes they're amazing... oh wait, that's all the time. One of my favourite scenes is when the T-Rex is attacking the car and a flashlight shines in its eye and the eye dilates. That just shows how detailed and alive these dinos are.But the dinosaurs don't wreak havoc until about halfway, or even 3/4, through the film. Even yet, the movie does a brilliant job of immersing you into it, bringing you onto this island, and getting you to care for the characters. The dialogue and acting are so good that you feel as though you're there with the characters (it drags sometimes but it's easy to get past that). And when they're in peril, you feel as though you're in danger too. I just can't stress how substantial the suspense in Jurassic Park is. The 3D does add to that, too. The 3D in this movie is probably the best post-converted 3D I've ever seen and it works really well.Jurassic Park is really a movie that everyone should experience (notice how I didn't say ""watch""). If you get the chance, see it in theaters and have your mind absolutely blown. The movie is full of awe and imagination; it sometimes makes me feel like a little kid again. The characters are likable; their dialogue is believable and sometimes humorous. The dinosaurs are awesome. The suspense is intense as hell. The soundtrack is perfect. It's a classic..."
"4142","Jurassic Park",10,"The best dinosaur movie there is; one of the best movies in general","I first saw this back when I was little. If I remember correctly, it was also a big thing when it came out. I even had a backpack with a Velociraptor head sticking out of it for school. It was such an amazing achievement as a movie itself and the film is so wonderfully done that there's no doubt of why it has held up as long as it has and will remain the best dinosaur film ever created.The dinosaurs in this film look more realistic than any other prehistoric film, or even most movies today that try to pass off crappy CGI has reality. The acting was spectacular, and aside from how wonderful the creatures look and how vicious and exciting they were like no other dinosaur film had had them before, the plot and characters were solid and incredibly entertaining where you didn't think they would be so amusing. I will have to say again that one really huge reason why most people loved this movie was because of the special effects, but here again, isn't that an accomplishment in itself? Having your audience enjoy the film because of how realistic and fresh you are able to make it feel and look? I have never seen another movie with better effects than this one, ever. I am sure none of these horrible effects dinosaur movies that have been coming out lately could ever live up to the greatness of Jurassic Park.I am always going to love Jurassic Park for it's witty, unbelievable maneuvers and incredible screenplay though, as well. It was so properly thought out and executed, where most might have been expecting it to be nothing but high levels of adrenaline rushes with brainless action, which there was pulsating action, it just certainly wasn't as mindless. Many who dislike Jurassic Park really just have all the same reasons the average movie-goer would have for disliking a film, yet I haven't heard anyone fully describe and explain, well, what they truly thought were faults with this film, which gives me reason to believe that Jurassic Park is a masterpiece, for I, myself, have no faults with this film, except that I have seen other films that I enjoyed more. . . just a little more."
"4143","Jurassic Park",NA,"Still a land mark in film making","It's hard to believe that it's 6 years since this film appeared at the cinemas. At the time it was a truly ground-breaking film, managing for the first time to portray dinosaurs in an extremely realistic manner, unlike those plasticine monsters that we were forced to watch in previous monster movies. Jurassic Park will also be remembered as the movie that finally made George Lucas sit up and realise that it was possible for him to make his prequels.In hindsight, while it is still an extremely well directed and tension filled movie, the script did seemed dumbed down in order to appeal to as many people as possible - but that's really irrelevant since this film is all about dinosaurs. One of Spielberg's brilliantly directed films, it even managed to make me forget Spielberg's previous disaster of a movie - do you recall HOOK?8/10."
"4144","Jurassic Park",NA,"Great Movie! One of Spielberg's best","Wow! That's about all one can say about this movie. The first time that I saw it I was mesmerized. The movie looked so cool and hey, it actually had a good plot. If you haven't seen this movie yet, get out from your cave and see it right away. I have seen this movie umpteen times and it still shocks and suprises me. If you have a DVD player I suggest that you buy the Jurassic Park 2 pack as soon as possible. The movie sounds and looks great, and the extras are cool too. So to summarize go see this. Spielberg is a true genius. Almost all of his movies were great. 10/10!"
"4145","Jurassic Park",10,"My favorite Movie","Steven Spielberg is known for making great movies like, ""E.T."" and ""Schindler's List"". But on June 11 1993. He released my favorite movie, ""Jurassic Park"".What make's this movie great is the special effects. They really brought the Dinosaurs to life. It also had some nice suspenseful scene's. Also, the acting was good. Sam Neil does a nice job as Alan Grant and Richard Attenborough does a great job as John Hammond. Plus, the theme song was incredible. Sometimes when you listen to it, it feel's like you're going to cry.In the end, ""Jurassic Park"", is a great film and it is definitely worth watching."
"4146","Jurassic Park",10,"Unlike anything the world had ever seen before.","This movie was released during my childhood while I was already a dinosaur enthusiast. I saw it 2 times at the cinema and as far as I can remember these were the only 2 times I ever saw an audience applaud at the end. It made an big impression. Computer generated images were new at that time and we didn't know what to expect. But I think I can speak for everyone if I say we were blown away. The dinosaurs looked so real. And even in the years after that computer generated images in other movies were just not as good and realistic as in Jurassic Park.Another thing that made this movie is the soundtrack. John Williams (the composer) absolutely nailed it! The music at the arrival to the island combined with the the adventure ahead was just breathtaking.So you have a good story, good actors (I loved Jeff Goldblum for his humor), state of the art special effects and an thrilling adventure. This makes it still my number one of all time and I don't expect that to change anytime soon (or ever)."
"4147","Jurassic Park",9,"Such a classic.","This movie is definitely one to remember. Despite being filmed in the 90s, Jurassic Park continues to be a classic to this day. 
Watching the movie now highlights the contrast between the effects then and the special effects available now. This, along with some acting that is a tad overdone, are the only real critiques I would give this film. 
The child actors were especially hilarious to me-the young boy, Timmy, has moments that really capture a reaction that a child in real life would have (""I threw up."" ""Well that's ok! That happens sometimes""-Allen-is one of my favorite quotes). 
Another extremely influential aspect of this film is the music that plays over certain intense scenes and the iconic theme music in the opening/closing. The music combined with the diegetic sound of the dinosaur stomping/approaching builds the suspense and creates an intense tension in the audience. 
As a classic worldwide, it's no wonder that this movie provided the basis for generations of movies to follow."
"4148","Jurassic Park",10,"The Movie to define a Generation.","If you were born in the 90s or before, you had a connection with people...you absolutely loved this movie, and it made a mark on you. I think most people remember when they saw this movie first, because it was that awe inspiring of an experience. I remember that it was the first pg-13 movie I was allowed to watch, and what a way to start my grown up movie experience!!!
Everything in this movie screams adventure, from the opening scene where the jungle leaves rustle, the shot of mysterious sparkling amber, to the landing of the helicopter on a remote rainforest island, the movie sets the tone for the greatest adventure movie ever made. As you hear John Williams glorious theme start to swell, and you see Alan remove his glasses and start to tremble, you know you're about to witness one of the most magical moments ever put on cinema. I can't go into detail on all the incredible scenes, from the T-Rex reveal, to the kitchen scene, but each one of them revolutionized what we thought movie magic could take us. Thank you Spielberg for making this enchanting piece of art for us, an entire generation is indebted to you."
"4149","Jurassic Park",10,"A legend","This movie is simply a legend. A date in history of cinema.With Terminator 2, Jurassic Park is one of the first movie that shows wonderful CGI. And now, it is forever one of the best, until his 21 years. Everything is just awesome. Spielberg at the summum of his art, John Williams create another time a legendary ost, and all the actors are just more than best, and especially two of the them. Richard Attenborough(RIP) play John Hammond, owner of Ingen and creator of Jurassic park. He is a very great actor (and director). He don't play John Hammond, for everybody who love cinema, he is John Hammond. And Sam Neil, what can i say about him ? Simply he is one genius. He is at the best with playing Alan Grant. For some people, he became just one role. Watching him in another program, i am sur that somebody would automatically said : it's the guy from Jurassic Park, Doctor Grant ! And that is the best for an actor, he leave his mark in the collective inconscious. Sam Neil is more an actor, he is a great man."
"4150","Jurassic Park",10,"Excellent","i really enjoyed this movie. it was worth my time. i also loved the casting and the director. i would see it again. in fact i actually bought it. i recommend it to someone who has not seen it because it is entertaining. even thought there are a few flaws in it it still is worth it. my sister also loves this movie and my whole family enjoys it as well. i love the sequels too. they actually match up with the first movie and there not one of those movies that you have to watch for a half hour to figure out what is going on.thanks a bunch-Elee"
"4151","Jurassic Park",10,"A milestone in cinematic history, a huge achievement in CGI effects, and by the most well-known director in the world.","Jurassic Park. An island full of dinosaurs who terrorise people; a simple premise but extremely well done. From beginning to end this film is just an enjoyable watch. Back in 1993 when it was released these never-before-seen effects had to have wowed audiences, and even now it still holds up with the anamatronics, CGI combo, it is really good; I've seen worst stuff in other movies and TV series. The characters I thought were pretty well done and acted, you really didn't want certain things happen to certain people and I really like Sam Neil as Alan Grant. Now, I was really exited to watch my favourite film on the big screen and especially in 3D, I watched it in IMAX as well, something I had never done before, and boy did it deliver. The 3D in this movie was one of the best I've seen in ages, better than Man of Steel and Iron Man 3 by far. Jurassic Park in the third dimension brought a whole new life too it, just some of the scenes with the trees, and leaves and then an awesome scene in the kitchen was good in 3D. So yes, I think Jurassic Park will continue being my favoured film for a long time to come."
"4152","Jurassic Park",10,"I'm amazed this isn't in the top 250!!","It still baffles me why this brilliant movie isn't in the top 250 movies for IMDB! it's amazing! I think this is the kind of film that people take too seriously and don't see the obvious reasons what make this such a great movie.  For one such as ""Jurassic Park"" it represents everything a summer blockbuster should be, (and why Spielberg is the king of 'blockbuster summer' movies).In all fairness, a film like this is only worth watching for the special effects (which still remain top-notch).  It is a dinosaur movie- it does exactly what it says on the tin- it thrills and amazes and never lets up, it is perfect popcorn fare and not since ""Jaws"" (the first proper summer blockbuster!) has a film so brilliantly had such an affect on movies which were to follow. Essentially it is ""Jaws"" on-land and it does so perfectly, with great pace great set-pieces.  I wish this film was in the top 250, if any movie deserves it , ""Jurassic Park"" does, not just for being such a great film but also for revolutionising films from there on out!!Brilliant!!!"
"4153","Jurassic Park",10,"A genre staple gets a much deserved re-release in 3D and IMAX.","Perhaps more so than any other director in film history, Steven Spielberg has locked into that most desirable niche of movie-making: pleasing everyone at the same time. When his spectacular action-adventure Jurassic Park was first released in 1993, he left critics, film buffs, casual viewers, parents and children equally spellbound. Twenty years later, the film has been re-released in both 3D and IMAX, allowing a new generation to experience the magic, and old fans the chance to relive it again.Eccentric millionaire John Hammond (Richard Attenborough) has created the ultimate theme park on a secluded island, and he wants to offer a sneak preview to a select group of individuals (Sam Neill, Jeff Goldblum and Laura Dern). Of course, the prehistoric attractions don't much appreciate being detained for the amusement of others, and begin to cause havoc as soon as they take the opportunity to escape from their enclosures. An extremely imaginative plot adapted from Michael Crichton's novel of the same name, it sets the foundation for a rip-roaring battle for survival.For many viewers that first saw Jurassic Park as pre-teens, the greatest thrill will come from appreciating, to a greater degree, the way the film deftly builds suspense. Cleverly building up to the revelation of the 'meatasauruses' by stunning us with the visual treat of cuddly herbivores, when we do finally meet the imposing Tyrannosaurus, it is one of cinema's most exhilarating set pieces, only to be topped some time later by the thrilling cat-and-mouse game in the kitchen.It is a testament to the incredible skill of the animatronics and visual effects team that the film's most dated quality is the occasionally cheesy dialogue that burdens Lex and little brother Tim. The dinosaurs are clearly the main event, but the undercard of Jurassic Park spares no expense, with touches of class including Dr. Grant's personal evolution from a child apathist to a fully-fledged family man and a miasma of Shelley-esque criticisms of man's innate desire to play god while drunk on the illusion of total control.To call this the movie event of the year would be to make the grossest of understatements. Experiencing this glorious monument to total escapism on the world's biggest cinema screen is simply mandatory for anyone was has ever felt goosebumps in a theater. Bring your kids- they'll never forget it.*There's nothing I love more than a bit of feedback, good or bad. So drop me a line on jnatsis@iprimus.com.au and let me know what you thought of my review. If you're looking for a writer for your movie website or other publication, I'd also love to hear from you.*"
"4154","Jurassic Park",10,"The best classic sci-fi action my number 1 personal favorite adventure Dinosaurs movie Steven Spielberg's ultimate thrill ride","Jurassic Park (1993) is one of the best classic science fiction action adventure movie one of my personal number 1 favorite adventure Dinosaurs films of all time. It is Steven Spielberg's ultimate thrill ride. It has great visual effects, breathtaking story, it has heart and soul it defines my childhood. I grew up with the film I used to had a t-shirt with Jurassic Park. I love the film to death it is the best one in the franchise it is my number 1 favorite film In the franchise we can say it is the best animal family movie for everyone including kids.It has wonderful score from John Williams, great cast it has Sam Neill, Laura Dern, Jeff Goldblum, Richard Attenborough, Samuel L. Jackson, Wayne Knight, Joseph Mazzello and Ariana Richards.The film is based on a novel from Michael Crichton the book come out 1990 the movie come out 1993 and Michael Crichton helped writing a script for the film. It was brilliant direction from Steven Spielberg about scientists tampering with nature, the film is also mixed with horror in which velociraptor try's to eat Dr. Ellie Sattler (Laura Dern) who finds a Ray Arnold's arm (Samuel L. Jackson). The effects are top notch, the CGI for 1993 is still good I love the design for T-Rex and the velociraptor fighting on the end. I love Brachiosaurus in this movie I love those dinosaurs so much.The story is original a group of scientist cloned dinosaurs they about to open a amusement park for people lead by John Hammond (Richard Attenborough) who invites on a island of Isla Nublar, four people paleontologist Dr. Alan Grant (Sam Neill), paleobotanist Dr. Ellie Sattler (Laura Dern), mathematician Ian Malcolm (Jeff Goldblum) and a lawyer Donald Gennaro (Martin Ferrero) to gave him their opinions. All three disagree with John Hammond that tempered with nature is wrong and only a lawyer agrees with John because he thinks the park will make a fortune. One of the employees Dennis Nedry (Wayne Knight) is planning to steal dinosaur eggs and during a preview tour, he causes a security power breakdown that allows its cloned dinosaur exhibits to run amok. Dr. Grant stays with the kids Tim (Joseph Mazzello) and Lex (Ariana Richards) alone in the park and he has to return to resort complex, meanwhile John Hammond, Dr. Ellie Sattler, Ian Malcolm, Ray Arnold and Robert Muldon (Bob Peck) trying to get the power back.I love Dr. Alan Grant I love the character he was a great hero, great adventurer great paleontologist and great researcher. I love Sam Neill his character was writen on his skin. I love the kids Tim and Lex Joseph Mazzello and Ariana Richards they were great kids who were Hammond's grandchildren I love them. The most heart in the film was Dr. Ellie Sattler (Laura Dern) because she cared about the animals she was a great human been she wanted to help a sick triceratops which I love the character so much. John Hammond (Richard Attenborough) I really miss the actor I love his character I love what he try to do I love him to dead it is a shame he is no longer with us. I like Dr. Ian Malcolm in this movie he wasn't annoying in this movie Jeff Goldblum was likable and decent.My favorite scenes in the movie are: The T-Rex chases the jeep down the road with Dr. Sattler, Ian Malcolm and Robert Muldon in an exciting car chase of an action sequence. I love in which Dr. Grant and kids are climbing over the fences and the fences are electricity high voltage the fence electrifies Tim and he fly's down off the fence great breathtaking scene ever. I love that scene. I love the action sequence in which Lex and Tim are cornered by a pair of velociraptors inside the main kitchen and fight for their survival. Another favorite scene of mine is when Ellie discovers Ray's severed arm in the maintenance shed and she sees the raptor that eat Ray try's to eat her. I really miss this movies and I miss my childhood. My best friend from my childhood was a huge fan of this film he collected comic books, action figures and he borrowed me his VHS tape of this film because I never seen the film before and I loved it.I love this film to death it has everything atmosphere, good wonderful effects, good scares, awesome thrills, breathtaking suspense on your sit, wonderful directing, great acting from everyone everything that makes the best movie in the adventure animal franchise. This is the best one in the franchise and my number 1 favorite dinosaurs film."
"4155","Jurassic Park",10,"Perfect","100% <U+0001F4AF>
One of the best movies of all time.
The cast, acting, action and mostly visuals are spectacular!!! Most of the sequels are also amazing!!!"
"4156","Jurassic Park",10,"Jurassic Park","I will start off by saying the novel Jurassic Park by Michael Crichton is my favourite novel of all time. I first read it when I was 12, and about a year before the movie came out.Needless to say, I was pumped for the film. I loved dinosaurs since I was six years old and couldn't wait for the movie.Even at that age I was a movie buff and knew that movie adaptions of books are never 100% accurate. And Jurassic Park was no different.Obviously marketed towards young children, the movie toned down a lot of the violence which happened in the novel. Understandably. But the movie was still full of jump scares and still retained the adventurous side of the novel down to a T.Steven Spielberg always amazes and this film possessed the cutting edge of technology at the time. The CGI and practical effects were amazing. This is how a movie with CGI should look like today. Have real environments with CGI elements. Unlike most movies today where 99% of the screen is CGI.Steven takes us on an amazing adventure through Jurassic Park along with fine actors such as Sam Neil, Jeff Goldblum, Linda Dream and Sir Richard Attenborough. The science behind the movie made it seem like it could really bring dinosaurs to life.I always wondered what a dinosaur would look like. And Jurassic Park showed me. A beautifully shot film with an equally beautiful score by John Williams.Check out the novel if you haven't read it as well"
"4157","It Chapter Two",5,"Call me ""old fashioned,"" but CGI monster overkill does nothing for me","I really, realllly wanted to like this film. As a huge fan of the original mini-series (and EVERYTHING Tim Curry), I knew I'd have a challenge going into both Chapter 1 and Chapter 2 with an open mind. I had to separate. I didn't have as high of expectations as I did for Chapter 1 as Part 2 of the mini series was much weaker than the Part 1 anyway as well as Stephen King's It (Book).The actors were great. Even the first few jump scares were decent, and then it just became overkill. And not scary whatsoever. All of the CGI monsters look ridiculous and completely take you out of the moment. I grew up watching 80s/90s horror (AND LOVING IT). The baddies were REAL and TERRIFYING. For example, Mrs. Massey, the bloated bathtub corpse in The Shining. That was a real, completely horrifying image that has stayed with me 30 years after I First saw the movie. I don't understand the obsession with CGI when there's no need for it.Sadly, this movie was just a drawn out bore."
"4158","It Chapter Two",2,"Was this a comedy or a scary movie???","Why they tried to add so much humor is beyond me. It ruined the entire movie.Now the guy that plays Pennywise did a great job. Except for the CGI Pennywise (that was out of his hands).When he played the character with no CGI I was blown away."
"4159","It Chapter Two",3,"BAD JOKE. JUMP SCARE. REPEAT","Agh.. WOAH! agh.. WOAH! agh.. WOAH! agh.. WOAH!
The beginning 30-40 mins was a decent setup, well shot and the dinner scene was somewhat funny. Then it all goes down hill from there."
"4160","It Chapter Two",1,"Thus movie is a disgrace...","...it is a disgrace because it is a gross betrayal of the original book. IT - the book - is a psychological thriller about friendship, about relationships, it is about the deep fears we have as kids and which grow with us until we are adults; it is about how we learn fighting and ultimately defeating these fears.
IT - the movie, this movie - is a cheap zombie movie stuffed with special effects and CGI with the sole purpose of jump-scaring the audience. There is no narrative, no storytelling, nothing more than a random - and awfully long - sequence of third league horror vignettes.
Shame on this movie!"
"4161","It Chapter Two",5,"I really wanted to love IT!!!!","Okay so saw the first remake of the movie, was absolutely in love. I went and saw the second one today and didn't feel any where near close to what I felt for the first one. It was super long but that isn't even what upset me. It was just lacking in delivery! Pennywise was hardly in the movie. He was in it but they spent so much time soul searching the past of the characters that the real present stuff went lacking. Needless to say the first remake is an all time favorite. This one, I definitely should've waited until it came out on DVD. Just being honest. The first one was way to good for this to be part 2. It didn't deliver the expectation that the first one set."
"4162","It Chapter Two",3,"If you're scared of CGI and don't want to get invested in the main characters, this is just for you..","Well, this was a waste..
This movie is just a long run of jumpscares (all the f'ing time), not at all scary CGI monsters and reusing of the same jokes and ""scares"". I don't think the director has used a single practical effect in this picture.There is no tension or character-investing in this movie, and the director manages to make the cast (who works with What they have been giving) look terrible in their acting. It is not scary, just very, very annoying and does not live up to either the book, the mini-tv series or part 1 of the reboot from 2017 (even though it also was an CGI orgy).If you like a horror movie, where you don't need a build of tension or the director sticking to a plot or giving the audience a decent payout, but just adds a lot of jumpscares for almost 3 hours - You will love this..
But hey, it's just my opinion.."
"4163","It Chapter Two",5,"Tim Curry in a clown costume is more terrifying than any CGI monster","I personally didn't enjoy IT 2017 so I didn't have much hope for part 2 but I was expecting them to at least tone down the CGI instead they went overkill with it no imagination used here just in your face flashy CGI effects that look fake and plastic the only thing frightening about this movie is that sadly because it made money at the box office more Stephen King books are going to get remakes and it won't be long before we get an all CGI Maximum Overdrive movie remake.There are more scenes with Pennywise transforming and creating twisted ways to mess with the returning losers club members but sadly they are all done with CGI and are all standard copy and paste scenes from the original mini series and when the movie finally gets to it's climax the makers of this ""Horror Movie"" think by simply making Pennywise bigger it instills more fear into the audience when really all it does is scream CGI and all the suspence is watered down to bigger pixels on screen than there where before ""Terrifying""The only and I do mean only saving grace this movie has is the cast they all do a great job on screen especially considering they have to pretend to be scared and flee in terror from a green screen it's not the actors fault this movie was a big let down.I recommend watching the original IT mini series if you haven't already seen it Tim Curry's performance as Pennywise is the reason why people who grew up in the 90s have a fear of clowns because a great actor in the right role can make all the difference in a movie Tim Curry will always be Pennywise no matter how many remakes are made just like Judy Garland will always be Dorothy in The Wizard of OZ there performance makes the movie so memorable and it can't be re-created no matter how much CGI you use."
"4164","It Chapter Two",2,"You'll float to the exit door","Everything special from chapter one an both of the originals completely removed for cheap not scary cgi effects, lost it's way for the all mighty Hollywood blockbuster dollar"
"4165","It Chapter Two",5,"I was bored through most of it","I couldn't wait for it to end.CGI was horrible at times.Wait for it to come out on video. At least you can pause it and take a break."
"4166","It Chapter Two",3,"Great cast totally wasted","The second iteration of IT is between a bad joke and kitschy horror, the kind one laughed at in the 90's. It completely unravels the good work done in the first outing and will go down in history as another of those movies, milking its former glory with a huge cast, thinking that movie watchers will fall for it."
"4167","It Chapter Two",1,"3 hours of nonsense","This is one of those movies that's built up to be the greatest film to hit the theater in a generation. I remember when the trailer came out--people began to rave about how good this film would be. Well this film sucked. Monumental waste of three hours. It was painful to watch. For lots of reasons. Jessica Chastain mailed it in. Bill Hader echoing F-bombs every other word. Ransome is a guy you want to punch. The only scene I enjoyed in the film was the scene with the old woman-and even that was ruined because the entire scene played out in the trailer. Worst, the movie wasn't even scary. CGI trickery. It was more like a Tim Burton film. And one other thing-the silly, over-the-top attempts at humor greatly diminished the film. For a film positing itself as the scariest adaptation of a King novel, the audience spent far too much time snickering at lame jokes. I want my money-and my three hours--back."
"4168","It Chapter Two",1,"Plain awful","It started good but then got utterly painful to watch. Sadly they don't make horror/thriller movies like the good old days. Sigh, at least scary movies had humor mixed in the ""horror"" of it."
"4169","It Chapter Two",3,"Too bad","My whole 3 points just goes to james mcavoy. It was too long. The first 90minutes was unnecessary. Also it wasnt scary after a while i mean heads with legs lots if blood or another disgusting things it was just not scary just nonsence. Sorry for my bad english I couldn't explain myself clearly."
"4170","It Chapter Two",5,"Disappointing","I was very excited to see this film, have been since 2017, when I saw the first one. Unfortunately, this one was a huge mess.I love the way the first IT didn't want to be JUST a horror movie, but rather took time to build up a story, emotional connection. That is what made it so different from all the other horror movies that are being made nowadays. HOWEVER, this was completely thrown out the window in the second one. Considering how incredibly long this movie is, 90% of it was just buildup for jumpscares, jumpscares themselves and weird CGI.The worst thing for me was that there were too many things going on, jumping all over the place. And most of it was just for shock value, nothing important to the story.What I did love was the casting, it was absolutely brilliant, especially Eddie.I guess this is once again a classic case of - bigger budget does not mean better movie, as well as more CGI does not mean better movie."
"4171","It Chapter Two",8,"Not your average horror movie","Very early on in 'It Chapter Two' there is some wink wink dialogue about an author writing a great book, but messing up the ending. Anyone who is familiar with the 'It' book or original mini-series will know the ending was not well liked. Here now though they had a chance to rectify things, and I can assure you they did. Not just in terms of the ending, but the entire second entry is actually a fantastically made film and in my opinion superior to part one.The film is exceptionally long for a horror movie at nearly three hours. The thing is though I can't see it having the same impact if it were much shorter. There was a lot of layers to fit in. This isn't your average ""fast-food"" horror like the 'Conjuring' universe films. This is as much a drama in a lot of ways as it is a horror. The first half of the film especially. A long time is taken reintroducing us to the characters, showing us where they are with their lives now and building up their résumés again. Then in the second half of the film (and yes I'm talking about almost an entire 90 minutes) the film kicks into hyper-drive with non-stop, in your face horror - and it is a sight to behold.The cast were again all perfectly selected. Bill Hader in particular steals the show. He is given some great one-liners to work with, much the same as Finn Wolfhard was, and he nails every one of them. There is also a great Stephen King cameo. This isn't just a case of blink and you'll miss him, he is given an entire scene with some hilarious dialogue. I wasn't sure whether 'It Chapter Two' would be able to stick the landing and give the story the ending that it deserves, but it certainly did. I had a great time with this movie and I think any lover of the genre will as well."
"4172","It Chapter Two",1,"Disappointed","Three hours, really? Didn't keep up to the expectations we had after chapter 1. Too many special effects (cgi) took away the charm of the movie!! Disappointed :("
"4173","It Chapter Two",1,"Terrible movie","Don't believe the positive reviews. This movie is such garbage that they can only be paid for by the studio responsible for ruining everyone's weekend. The people that didn't walk out were laughing at every attempt at being scary. I've been an imdb user for over a decade and this is the first movie so bad that I felt compelled to warn people."
"4174","It Chapter Two",1,"Horrible","For anyone who believes that this movie was scary or even a decent movie clearly has no taste in films. From the script right down to the acting it was horrid. I didn't have much expectations after the first movie but this was surprisingly bad. There was no point in this movie that I was scared or even felt suspense. The most I got out of this movie was a few laughs at just how horrible it was. I highly recommend not ever watching this movie unless you enjoy corny and predictable movies/acting."
"4175","It Chapter Two",1,"Degrading for a human mind.","This is where our society ended up. Absolute nonsense."
"4176","It Chapter Two",1,"How could they get it so wrong?! Gutted.","Anyone who's read the book will find this an abomination. Anyone expecting a horror film, it isn't. I enjoyed the first, it had suspense, Pennywise had his dark, crazy moments, just the way he would stare for a second or 2 had a creepy factor. This has nothing, NOTHING. When a supposed horror film has the people laughing at 90% of what's going on, they've done it massively wrong. They tried to make IT a comedy!. I know a lot who haven't seen it yet will find that hard to believe, but it's true. There are so many ""comedy"" 1 liners thrown in at times when a normal person just wouldn't react that way, it's unbelievable. The CGI is terrible, real bad and they use it for 95% of everything going on. It doesn't follow its own certain rules that it sets down in parts. Many, MANY of the things wrong with this film I won't say due to spoilers.
SPOILER FREE about the end. If you thought it couldn't get anymore ridiculous than what you know from previous, well...you'll see.
The acting was decent, that's the 1 star.
IT is the only book I've read twice and enjoyed just as much the second time round as the first and everyone knows how big the book is. I'm gonna read it again to try and rid the memory of this terrible, terrible vision.
Gutted. I really am."
"4177","It Chapter Two",1,"Overlong, Moronic Rubbish, Give It A Miss","IT 2At 169 minutes it was just too long, after careful consideration as to where to cut this I arrived at the formed viewpoint I could cut out the whole 169 minutes and stay at home instead as this really was a rambling dogs breakfast of a movie.What was wrong, almost everything, this is deeply disappointing after IT 1 which was a great coming of age movie with horror thrown in.1, where was the story, Pennywise back, group return and try to destroy him, that's it.2, the significance of memory, I can't remember what I had for dinner yesterday let alone 27 years ago, hardly a revelation then they have forgotten stuff.3, collecting tokens, this just created a series of cameos, at best a contrivance at worst episodic nonsense.4, no character development at all, the director was obsessed that we were able to recognise which adult the child had grown into, perhaps colour coding or a label would have worked better.5, no internal motivation for Pennywise, why come back, why be evil, why kill, why this group of children, why Derry etc etc6, the actors whilst proficient did not gel, I guess this was the tripe of a script and the nonsensical direction against the CGI backdrop.What was goodNOTHING, don't bother with this banal, overlong, incoherent rubbish."
"4178","It Chapter Two",6,"""It Chapter Two"": Too Long for Too Little","In 1913, Henry Ford introduced the assembly line to the Ford Motor Company. He made a ton of money and was hailed as a leading innovator. Now just a hundred years later, director Andy Musciehtti brings that same assembly line principle to It Chapter Two as he serves up his scary products in the exact fashion as the one before.This sequel to the highest-grossing horror movie of all time (unadjusted) takes place 27 years later in the same town of Derry, Maine. The rambunctious kids are all adults now and have gone on their separate paths to some form of success. Unfortunately, the good fortune for each is put to an end by the return of Pennywise, who seeks more victims for his twisted games. Being the only ones that have stopped the evil force, the adults must come together again to put an end to this bloody mess.Director Andy Muschietti returns behind the camera after the record-breaking success he earned from 2017's ""It"". For the second time around, Muschietti goes even bigger and bolder than before, both in terms of the horror set pieces and the length.When it comes to giving audiences what they came to see, Muschietti delivers on adding even more blood, gore, and creepiness. Pennywise's indescribable powers get even more creative as his prey are stalked and slaughtered with unnerving brutality.The biggest fault that plagued the previous film was its recycling of cheap jump scares that were meant to artificially hold your attention. That same problem is even more glaring in the sequel as any scary moments are just startling moments where something pops out at the screen. The more they happen, the more predictable and boring they are to watch.A runtime is never indicative of quality by itself, every movie should earn its length through skill and craftsmanship. And at 170 minutes, ""It Chapter Two"" falls way short of earning its record-breaking runtime. Instead of the horror being a slow burn, it's more of a slow churn as the recycled jump scares quickly lose their minuscule luster and make this already long film feel even longer.Screenwriter Gary Dauberman takes up the impossible task of adapting Stephen King, a challenge that has killed the careers of countless adapters before him.Dauberman tries his best to break away from the ridiculousness within King's novel, but his efforts end up backfiring on him and make the film even more awkward as some elements are left in and some left out. The story wants you to take it pretty seriously, but keeping in the weird elements make that almost an impossible task.Muschietti didn't do much to justify the excessive length, but Dauberman should shoulder more of the blame with his uneven pacing. The film starts great with the together and playing off each other with a fun and brisk pace. Then, against all logic, Dauberman has them split up for ninety minutes, severely slowing things to a crawl and forcing the jump scares to keep you awake.The highest regards should go to casting director Rich Delia as he has brilliantly put together a group of adult actors that uncannily look like their younger counterparts. Unfortunately, good looks are the only quality some actors possess here.James McAvoy does fine as Bill. The most evident acting trait he shows off is his struggle to hide his Scottish accent with a less than convincing New England one.Having a rocky 2019, to say the least, Jessica Chastain follows up the bomb that was ""Dark Phoenix"" with another subpar performance. She doesn't shine as brightly as Sophia Lillis' younger Beverly despite being the more acclaimed actress with a lot more screen time.The standout performances come from the two Bills in the cast, Hader and Skarsgård. Hader plays adult Richie and fairs the best in the cast at toeing the line between drama and comedy.Skarsgård as Pennywise is a sight to see but unfortunately doesn't get seen for long stretches. Between him and Heath Ledger's Joker, future performances for clowns now have an insanely high bar to reach.With over five hours of material between two films, the ""It"" series has come to a less than satisfying close with ""It Chapter Two"". There are some things to admire Muschietti and co. for doing or trying to do. But for every great Bill Skarsgård moment (which is all of them), there were just as many moments of wasted potential due to unoriginal filmmaking. Overall, between its highs and lows, ""It Chapter Two"" makes for a semi-enjoyable time. Just make sure to bring a seat cushion."
"4179","It Chapter Two",10,"I think some maybe even most people are treating this as if it were a straight up sequel when they really shouldn't.","Although Stephen King's IT novel is more of back and forth from adult to kid and back and forth from adult to kid and so on, IT : Chapter 2 should be looked at like it's the 2nd half of one big story, which is exactly what it is rather than a sequel. It's really not a sequel. Just like the 2nd half or ""adult half"" of the 1990 TV Miniseries/movie is not a sequel, it's just the 2nd half of one big story/movie. Let's face it, unless they're the Godfather Part 2, Aliens, Terminator 2 : Judgement Day, The Dark Knight, The Empire Strikes Back, and maybe a couple of other big time hit sequels, the sequel almost always gets hated on, critiqued to death, disregarded as ""unoriginal"", ""same old same old"", ""not very creative"", treated like the ""intruder"", etc etc....it's the same for 90% of remakes..but people need to realize and understand that IT : Chapter 2 is not a sequel and that IT : Chapter 1 and IT : Chapter aren't remakes to the 1990 TV minseries/movie either.Secondly, almost every negative review on Rotten Tomatoes or YouTube or on the Internet somewhere (and I'm pretty sure they'll make their way onto here sooner or later as well) have complaints about the runtime of 2 hours and 49 minutes and that it's ""too long"" and blah blah blah. I don't see how you can make this whole story put to film not be at least 5+ hours long (Chapter 1 and Chapter 2 combined)..at the VERY least. The novel is over 1,100 pages long ! 1,138 pages to be exact. ""IT"" should have been a 10-15 1 hour episode series on Netflix to be done properly, to be honest..but if you go the cinema route with it (and they did, obviously), between Chapter 1 and Chapter 2, it has to be, at the very least, 5 hours or so if the Director or Writers want to be even remotely faithful to King's novel and make fans of King and the novel at least somewhat satisfied. And you also have 7 protagonists..SEVEN..6 of which are main protagonists. That's A LOT character developing and character story arcs that have to be told and take place unless you want a lazily and poorly directed and written film with terrible story telling and bad or no/next to no character development.This film delivers great character development and great character and story arcs for all of the main protagonists/characters of the film. This film is really entertaining overall. There are pacing issues but those really seem minor when you step back and look at this film as a whole. This film was really good on it's own and holds up very well on it's own. Yes, it relied on Chapter 1 some, obviously, because Chapter 1 is part of the overall story (Again, it's NOT a sequel. I'm really talking about how well Chapter 2 is made when saying ""it's really good on it's own) but when you put Chapter 1 and Chapter 2 together and make it one big story/film like it should be, it's AWESOME. Pennywise is also at his most serious and gruesome in this one. This one doesn't cut away just as someone or a helpless kid is about to get bitten or eaten until after you see and hear plenty enough, if you know what I mean. More gore in this one. It definitely earns every bit of it's R rating. Bill Hader, Jessica Chastain, Bill Skarsgard, and James Mcavoy are excellent, especially Hader and Skarsgard. Nobody was bad though..everyone was, at least, good. The CGI was also much better in this one..of course it would be though because it had a much bigger budget to work with than Chapter 1 did.My biggest con..and it's the same as my biggest con for Chapter 1. Too many ill timed funny jokes. 2 or 3 jokes when it's the right time for them are great and it works. It lightens things up even if just for a few seconds and during the RIGHT times. And this film has a few well timed funny moments as well, don't get me wrong. But the funny/comedy/jokes at the wrong times, especially in a horror movie, just suck, to put it simply. It ruins scenes especially scenes that are supposed to be or should be horrifying and terrifying and scary and making you nervous and tense and scared and such. And unfortunately, this film has those ill timed/placed jokes as well.Overall though, this film is great..especially when you look at as whole with Chapter 1."
"4180","It Chapter Two",3,"This didn't need to exist","""Omg the cast is just so perfect"" isn't grounds to call this a good movie. The casting is indeed spot on and most of the actors (adults and kids alike) are great, but not even the best actors in the world can save an uncompelling story such as this one.Most of the 2hr 50min runtime is the EXACT same movie as the first chapter, except this time the jump scares come even cheaper. It gets old very quickly. Trim it about...hmm...an hour and a half and then we may have something.The most frustrating thing about It: Chapter Two is the way it so carelessly handles both the origins of Pennywise (including the way to actually defeating him) and the deeper themes and challenges of these characters. There was so much potential for emotional depth in this story, instead that was traded for the same sort of anthology type structure of the first film that, as stated before, overly relied on cheap scares. Ironically, this movie isn't scary at all because of that.Despite the length, this chapter added next to nothing to the original story. Go for performances and funny character moments. But other than that, I can't really say that this will be worth the amount of time it demands from you."
"4181","It Chapter Two",9,"My Review","I love IT Chapter Two!! I understand what some people are saying is wrong with this movie and I too have some problems with the movie, but this movie is still amazing. The casting choice is the best I've ever seen, especially with Bill Hader as Richie, Finn Wolfhard in the first movie was the highlight for Chapter One and this time Bill Hader is the highlight for Chapter Two. The final confrontation is amazing, I was not disappointed with it at all, the giant spider from the original TV miniseries as a huge disappointment but the monster for this film is AMAZING. Going to be honest, I am interested to see if there will ever be an IT Chapter Three movie, if there ever will be one, I hope is an origin movie for Pennywise and maybe we can get a scene with the Turtle fighting IT."
"4182","Money Plane",3,"Straight-to-Video Tripe","Do not be fooled by the presence of Grammar or Jane -- this movie is C-tier 'entertainment', through the through. The lead ""sports entertainment"" wrestler and now budding actor, is as wooden as an oak tree (parried by amateurishly unseasoned / ridiculously overacting cohorts); the plot is derr-dumb stupid; the seasoned ""with"" actors are merely serviceable (strictly in the context of such a rubbishy project); and the overall product is little more than an exercise in pay cheque accrual. Meaningless, uninspired rubbish.The ""streaming"" era and the various platforms' esurience for content, has spawned an utter glut of substandard films from substandard 'creative talent', that reach a far larger audience than they should otherwise ever merit. This film as an exemplar of thus lowering of the bar.

"4185","Money Plane",5,"One of the better 5th grade drama class productions","Clearly this film is B-grade, low budget - of which I'm sure most of the budget went to Kelsey Grammer and Denise Richards, written in part and directed by actor turned newb filmmaker, Andrew Lawrence. There were a total of 4 writers, for a story that was fairly decent and actually funny (not sure if it was meant to be). The acting by almost everyone including WWE's ""Edge"" wrestler turned actor Adam Copeland, was terrible. If felt unauthentic, forced and very amateurish. I'm sure the blame falls mostly on Lawrence's inexperience in directing his cast properly. A pro tip to all new filmmakers: you don't need a constant annoying and overbearing score throughout the entire 82 mins of film - of which was mostly louder than the dialogue. The poor pacing and annoying editing made it feel like a 2+ hour film. The sets were so cheese and phony - add the bad score and acting, is why I classified this as a 5th grade drama class production. I get that all filmmakers have to start somewhere, but attaching some popular names to a film, isn't as good as having just decent actors, a better set, and an assistant seasoned director that can teach you something along the way. I'd rather stumble on a non-big-name film and be impressed, than watch one because of popular actors attached, and laugh and cringe throughout the film. Nevertheless, still a fun bored-lazy Sunday popcorn flick from a newb filmmaker. It's a generous 5/10 from me."
"4186","Money Plane",4,"Could have been sooo much more!","The idea behind this Movie had potential and was quite interesting and with a bigger budget, bigger stars and a better director, this could have been good. Sadly with a low straight to DVD / TV Movie budget (or that's how it felt), poor direction it just fell over from the start. Alarm bells rang when you see the Director is also one of the stars and has his Family involved as well. Kelsey Grammer, Thomas Jane and Denise Richards are there to hopefully give the Film some gravitas but sadly they are all minor roles and all are extremely under used. In the escape scene at the start, The guns used when firing look / sound more like kids cap guns and scenes on the plane could have been shot in rooms in a Warehouse. Also very predictable, you could see every supposed twist a mile away, just very disappointed overall."

Outside of that you have a somewhat predictable run of the mill heist movie that does nothing great and only a few things well.If you watch because of Edge you might enjoy it but for anyone else who isn't aware of who he is you most likely will not enjoy the movie. His role as leader of the team kind of takes a backseat to everyone else he is working with. You don't get much if any action from him at all, its mostly his team doing all the work.Joey Lawrence is fine but he's not really given much to work with. There isn't really anything to his character which is the case for pretty much everyone in the movie. Also the casting of his brother is very odd as you can clearly see they look a like but their characters have no relation.Kelsey Grammer looks like he had fun in the role even though he is very much a typical bad guy.There are a few good moments in an otherwise mediocre story. If that kind of movie appeals to you then go for it, but you won't be missing anything by skipping this one."
"4202","Money Plane",5,"Money Plain","Money Plane was directed and co-written by Andrew Lawrence, written by Tim Schaaf, and stars Adam Copeland, Katrina Norman, Patrick Lamont Jr, Andrew Lawrence, Al Sapienza, Aleksander Vayshelboym, Joey Lawrence, Thomas Jane, Kelsey Grammer, and Denise Richards. It is about a professional thief and his crew robbing an airborne casino occupied by dangerous criminals in hopes of seeing his family again.The plot and its details are all pretty standard, but there are some good ideas. Jack (Copeland) and his crew members Isabella, Trey, and Iggy (Norman, Lamont Jr., and Andrew Lawrence) fumble a job that loses the Rumble (Grammer) $40 million so he forces the crew to board the Money Plane to pay him back. If they fail they, alongside Jack's wife Sarah (Richards), will suffer the consequences. The possibility for over-the-top excitement exists, with a potential colorful cast of characters doing insanely evil deeds to bring thrills, but it never happens. Iggy and Jack's friend Harry (Jane) stay on the ground to deal with issues and defend Jack's family. The crew have to navigate through the worst of the worst, including Ivan, the Bookkeeper. Concierge, and Cowboy (Vayshelboym, Sapienza, and Lawrences) to get the money and get out. Formula.Characters are decent in the movie. Jack has a family and friends that make for a solid emotional anchor for the man. He is noted to have a history of gambling addiction, which should make for a more involved series of bets, however this point and its potential effects on the man is rarely touched on, instead that burden is handed over to Trey. Trey has the most interesting dilemma of taking on increasingly dangerous games in order to keep his cover from being broken. Isabella fares similarly, having to deal with creeps and weirdos as she navigates the plane. The baddies are all woefully bland, however, which sullies the fun. The Bookkeeper is the best of the bunch, being a hands-on person who takes pleasure in watching the pain. Iggy and Harry are decent supporting characters that help give authenticity to a crazy premise, and The Rumble is a standard rich bad guy. Performances are equally mixed, with Copeland showing no emotion and a singular expression on his face. Lamont Jr. and Norman are solid as the support to Jack, and Sapienza and Vayshelboym are fantastic as the slimy staff. Jane and Grammer do not appear for long but they make the most of their lines. The umpteen Lawrences in the movie are the weaker links.Action in the movie is weak. There are a lot of hand-to-hand sequences and the only one that is anything to remember is one where Ivan throws Trey around in a server room. The stunt work on display there is solid. The rest is banal, leaving no impression due to the limited space to work with. Gunfights look awful, with those involved with the fights shooting at nothing and showing little in the way of intelligence; they act like drones. Speaking of drones, Harry controls a drone with a gun attached to it that makes for some fun, campy action that does not last for as long as is wanted. CGI blood is peppered throughout to little surprise. Some practical blood gets used towards the end, but by then it is too little too late.Technically the movie shows its hand (pun if you want it). It is clearly low budget, no question. Interiors are sparsely decorated, with the inside of the plane looking passable when the scene is set in one of the rooms with games and drinks inside, but looking abysmal when the characters are in the cargo hold and the hallways down below the passenger seating. Cinematography is bland in every situation, never embracing the tight quarters (by choice anyway) to enhance the action or any potential claustrophobic interiors. Greenscreen is also easy to see, with the sky outside the cockpit looking like something from the mid to late 90's. The lack of budget is forgivable, but the sloppy presentation is not.Money Plane is a harmless low budget action movie with a promising idea that does not get the presentation it deserves. The movie could have gone over-the-top for its entirety and been all the better for it, but it plays it safe and takes little in the way of risk.55/100"
"4203","Ip Man 4: The Finale",1,"HUGE EMBARRASSMENT & DISAPPOINTMENT","As a Chinese, this was nothing but embarrassing. It has no plot, no acting skills, and no moral. It portrayed Americans as brainless prejudiced hatred-filled demons. The essence of the movie is pretty much ""hey, Chinese pig you want to fight?"" ""Sure, lets fight."" Please Avoid if you cherish your time and your life."
"4204","Ip Man 4: The Finale",1,"Beyond moronic","The first one was good. The second and third were schmalzy money grabs but still watchable. This is an absolute joke. Imagine a comic book writer trying to make a serious movie. Every single moment of this is pure cringe. Even the most brainwashed Chinese robot must be able to see through this.Absolute waste of time."
"4205","Ip Man 4: The Finale",3,"Just another chinese propaganda movie","First things first, I really like the the first two Ip Man movies, even they were also packed with propaganda, they had a kind of comprehensible billing element to it. In particular the fight against the japanese occupation and Ip Man's migration to Hong Kong in 1949 and his attempt to install his Wing Chun martial art school.But the 4th and final part of the saga is just unbearably bad. Bad script and a bad plot, in other worth it is actually just an awful movie that uses two of martial arts all time greats in Ip Man and Bruce Lee, to spread chinese propaganda around the globe."
"4206","Ip Man 4: The Finale",4,"More about racism than anything","The fight scenes were good as usual and I love the depiction of Ip Man as being calm, honorable and good. It was nice to see Bruce Lee in a few scenes, very few. You can feel that the end of Ip Man is coming in how the story moves along. I did enjoy this movie to a point because it gave a conclusion to Ip Man's story, but half of the movie seemed to be focused on white people being racist toward every other race which most movies and tv shows in this age of political correctness like to focus on now.There is a big difference in the story telling from the first Ip Man to this final installment. The first had a great story that did not try to stereotype anyone or any race. This one is focused on race period. If you want to see the conclusion to a once great franchise, I recommend this as a rental, but otherwise, I cannot recommend it."
"4207","Ip Man 4: The Finale",10,"Good fighting scenes, Finale good.","I like how the setting is displayed and there's a lot of action scenes between Donnie yen and Scott Adkins. This bring a lot of excitement to us, hope to make more of movies like this in the future."
"4208","Ip Man 4: The Finale",2,"What a shame","Being a fan of the first three I thoughy I was in for a good time. I lasted about 30 minutes, then I had to stop. This movie is so filled with outdated tropes and ridiculous political agenda. I did not think there would be anything worse than the current wokeness of Hollywood, but this takes the prize. I won't take it from Hollywood, and definitely not from China. Also free Hong Kong."
"4209","Ip Man 4: The Finale",1,"Terrible film to end the saga","By far the worst of the Ip Man films. Aside from some good action scenes, the film overall is terrible. And also a bit racist towards white people, painting them all as horrible bullying bigots. Also dumb was the decision to have one person speak to the other in Cantonese and the other replies in Mandarin. It's like someone talking to you in French and you reply in English even though you don't understand French. Another terrible decision was casting Vanda Margraf who is clearly mixed-race to play the daughter of someone whose character would never enter into a relationship with a white woman."
"4210","Ip Man 4: The Finale",1,"Really Unfortunate end to a great movie series","First let me say that I loved the first 3 movies and Donnie Yen is one of my favorite Kung Fu actors... But this movie is just trash. I don't know how you can ruin a great franchise more completely then they did with this movie. Zero plot with just a bunch of racist propaganda thrown in to try and get a reaction. Fight scenes were decent but felt contrived. Historically inaccurate at every turn, I mean no one is looking for a documentary here but c'mon lets at least try a little. If you really like the first 3 movies do yourself a favor and stop there."
"4211","Ip Man 4: The Finale",10,"Great story","Unfortunately the last one. But the ending is also what makes it great"
"4212","Ip Man 4: The Finale",2,"Every time they drag Mr Yip Man back, it gets worse","Let me start by saying, the first movie is my favourite of all time, it has character, a great storyline, beautiful fight choreography.This however, constant changes between languages, none of the white people can act so I find myself cringing the whole time, it's like they scraped the bottom of the amateur dramatic barrel for these people and it just distracts from the whole movie.The fight scenes have become ridiculous, a constant bid to out do the previous movies, with the addition of seeing Mr Yip Man gliding through the air several times, you didn't need this in the first movie to make it great, so why now?Now onto the plot, which is nothing more than a propaganda flick, I find it hard to swallow when Chinese movies are talking about how the Chinese are the victim of bullying and racism, while irl they have Uighir Muslims locked up in re-education camps and signs on their businesses saying that no black people are allowed.On top of this, the whole movie is based on the premise that EVERY single white person without failure is racist and hates Chinese people, if that were the case Bruce would never have been famous.Historically speaking also, this movie is inaccurate, Yip Man would have been 71 at the time this movie based and yet he's just as indestructible as he ever was, I'm willing to overlook the travelling to America to meet Bruce etc (Bruce just attended his class, Yip never trained him because of his mixed heritage, he left that to Wong Sheung Leung) Yip was also never a fan of teaching non Chinese, after attending his sons classes at the VTAA in Hong Kong I can tell you that there is still a bias against white people.All in all, this movie was trash, to the point it has tainted the rest of this awesome series for me"
"4213","Ip Man 4: The Finale",5,"Below expectations","The fighting scenes were good but the acting was terrible from most of the actors, actually almost all the actors. The scenario and all the conversations are stupid and boring. No twist in the movie, from the first minute i could be able to know what will happen however i still enjoyed the fighting."
"4214","Ip Man 4: The Finale",10,"Donnie Yen, thank you for the finale","Saw it at the theatres, such an amazing finale.Donnie, you're an amazing martial artist. Lived up to IP MAN's legacy."
"4215","Ip Man 4: The Finale",6,"By far the worst of the IP Man movies","I consider the IP Man movies the best kung-fu movies, period. Especially the first two. My expectations were high. They were not met.This movie is just recycling the formula of the prior movies, but does it much worse. The fight scenes also didn't really match the intensity and choreography of any of the earlier films. The stuff in between the fight scenes was poorly written with poor acting. Donnie Yen is so much better than this. Thankfully this should be the end of this movie franchise.Now do a film about Bruce Lee at IP Man's school."
"4216","Ip Man 4: The Finale",1,"Sad way to end great series","First two movies were beautiful, funny, touching and wonderful cinema. Third movie was ok but lost some of the soul of the original 2. This final (4th) movie was even worse. So sad to see the series end on a stupid, leftist note. Very depressing."
"4217","Ip Man 4: The Finale",4,"Nonono","Personally feel that the presentation of the story is too stiff and politically strong"
"4218","Ip Man 4: The Finale",9,"A must watch","Now that's how you make a proper film. The whole movie was super impressive. Never got bored."
"4219","Ip Man 4: The Finale",7,"Racism was wayyy overplayed","The good, watchable parts of the movie centered on Donnie Yen and the challenges of parenting. The martial arts scenes were entertaining and effective, as was the presence of Bruce Lee and his school.
Banda Margraf balanced all the heavy characters like a breath of fresh air, her character was like able, watchable, and gave Ip Man insight.
The story was mostly set in San Francisco, so as a yank it was disconcerting to see the many little things that the movie didn't get right. The big things, like the closest Marine base is 300 miles away, are forgiveable (they're telling a story and need a villain).
But the little things, like federal officers would be bearded and wearing black leather jackets, like Kung fu movie villains, took away from the movie. And just to get this straight, A Marine can not walk into an ICE building and demand a prisoner be handed over since the ICE agent is more afraid of losing his pension than of getting beaten.
This film is tainted by claiming that overt violent hatred of Chinese, to the extent that our military targeted them, existed. This at a time when China is trying to make the US look bad so they can illegally grab the South China Sea."
"4220","Ip Man 4: The Finale",1,"Stay away from this stinker at all cost.","I don't know where to start how bad this movie is.
Is the producer a 10 year old kid?
Please stop making crap like this anymore and actually put some thought into what you are producing...
Don't understand all the 8-10 stars reviews, they must be brain-dead Bruce Lee followers."
"4221","Ip Man 4: The Finale",9,"Good story and marvellous action","The finale of IP man saga was beautifully written with a great story and amazing acting. You must go and watch in theatre.This is a must watch this Christmas season"
"4222","Ip Man 4: The Finale",3,"Another piece of East meets West mediocrity","Silly story, fake characterisations - why did most of the Chinese speak Cantonese while Wan and daughter spoke Mandarin ?
Poor acting and even ho-hum fight scenes.
As another reviewer said, the Ip man saga should have ended with 3."
"4223","Ip Man 4: The Finale",1,"Racial attack against white people","So poor movie with political context , white people = bad . Stop with that racial attacks , people are good in nature some people in power want recial wars and hollywood is happy to help with that cause . Chaos is ladder and ladder equals money"
"4224","Ip Man 4: The Finale",10,"Excellence redefined","An excellent movie. A great finale. Hidup Ip and Bruce Lee. You are true great Asian Heroes"
"4225","Ip Man 4: The Finale",2,"Why does this movie even exist?","It should have ended with number 3, would have made a good trilogy. Ip Man never made such a trip to the US.This movie exists solely to spread nationalist propaganda and white-man hate.The story is bland. The characters are over the top and one dimensional, and are not believable as real people. The dialogue was very exaggerated and filled with racism to incite hate, with the main purpose of setting up the fight scenes. No one says anything meaningful and impactful. The actions of some of the characters would have had dire legal repercussions in real life, but had no ramifications at all in the movie.The only merit are the well shot and choreographed fight scenes, if not for those, I would have rated this movie a 1/10."
"4226","Ip Man 4: The Finale",3,"Bad acting and storywriting","The story is good, but the screenwriting is off.. too stiff and sometimes it's hanging. And some of the acting is just bad ..duh"
"4227","Ip Man 4: The Finale",9,"The finale to Legendary kung Fu GrandMaster","I have no words.Never wanted the Ip Man chapter to end.
But this was the greatest Finale and best tribute to Yip Man.The movie was full of emotions and good teachings which kung fu teaches to one. A must watch.Love Yip Man."
